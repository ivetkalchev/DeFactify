Dalai Lama Revises Claim Life Only Suffering When Not Listening To Golden-Era Supertramp,https://theonion.com/dalai-lama-revises-claim-life-only-suffering-when-not-listening-to-golden-era-supertramp/,The Onion,,2025-02-17T08:00:00-06:00,"DHARAMSHALA, INDIA—The Dalai Lama announced in a press conference Monday that he has revised his position that suffering is an inevitable fact of life and that he now believes life is only suffering when one is not listening to golden-era Supertramp. “I was recently lent a remastered version ofBreakfast In America, and it went down so damn smooth that it completely shifted my stance on pain and the human condition,” said His Holiness, admitting that the proclamation upends the conceptual grounding of Buddhism’s Four Noble Truths. “Humanity can free itself from pain by throwing on “Goodbye Stranger” and cranking that shit up until you feel like you’re floating. Also, attachment to desire is totally okay if what you desire is the intricate musical arrangements and artful melody of Britain’s best prog rock band.

New Evidence Suggests Humans Developed Written Language To Avoid Breaking Up In Person,https://theonion.com/new-evidence-suggests-humans-developed-written-language-to-avoid-breaking-up-in-person/,The Onion,,2025-02-14T11:21:13-06:00,"CHICAGO—Noting that early humans’ aversion to confrontation played a critical role in their evolution, a new study published Friday in theAmerican Journal Of Archaeologyconcluded that written language was first developed to avoid breaking up in person. “According to our findings, early Mesopotamians created the first cuneiform tablets in 3200 BCE because they couldn’t bear the idea of looking their partner in the eye and ending things face-to-face,” said the study’s author, Professor Jason Greene, who added that once humans learned how effective a breakup note transcribed on papyrus, clay, or animal skin could be, they began developing a variety of symbols to quickly and effectively call a relationship off. “Some of the earliest pictographs, like a broken heart, a withered rose, or crossed out stick figures standing side by side, were seemingly quite effective for avoiding an in-person argument. But based on our evidence, our ancestors eventually developed a phonetic alphabet to convey more complex ideas, like that it might be best for them to open their relationship, or to take a short break and try seeing other people.” Greene added that early humans also developed hunting spears as a way to avoid going through the trouble of divorce.

Nation Vies For   Approval Of Cool Dog,https://theonion.com/nation-vies-for-approval-of-cool-dog/,The Onion,,2025-01-31T10:58:44-06:00,"WASHINGTON—Hopelessly captivated by the animal’s cheerful energy and striking appearance, the U.S. populace reportedly converged upon a D.C.-area park Tuesday where sources confirmed that all 340 million Americans were vying for the approval of a cool dog.

Several reports indicated the charismatic, carefree border collie, named Scout, was first spotted dashing across Georgetown Waterfront Park, leaping high into the air, catching a Frisbee in his mouth, and then running back to drop the disc at his owner’s feet. Americans across the country were said to have gasped and stopped in their tracks before eagerly making their way to the cool dog, patting their thighs, and complimenting him in a higher-than-normal register.

“Oh my gosh, what an amazing pup,” said Connecticut resident and MRI technician Ken Piper, one of millions who descended upon the park to bend forward and offer the back of their hand for the easy-going canine to sniff. “Just look at that adorable furry face and those perky ears. He’s so calm and composed. He never seems to doubt himself.”

Sources said the entire population circled around Scout and jockeyed for positions near him, kneeling down on the ground and reaching out to shake his paw. The nation reportedly made countless overtures to court the border collie’s favor, such as whistling, jumping up and down, and barking in imitation of him.

In the hours since discovering the cool dog, Americans are believed to have offered him millions of tennis balls, squeaky toys, and knotted tug ropes, though none of the gifts have prompted the animal to reciprocate even a fraction of the interest being directed at him.

“Hey, buddy, look at this stick! Here’s a stick,” said Kansas paralegal Erica Shane, who desperately pleaded for Scout’s attention among throngs of stick-waving Americans before she threw her own stick and it joined a hail of similar projectiles, all of which landed in a massive heap several feet behind the dog. “All right, buddy, goooooo get it!”

Millions of Americans are reported to have watched forlornly as Scout merely scratched at his left ear instead of heeding their frantic cries of “Go get the stick!”

According to a nationwide poll, 81% of respondents said they wanted to give Scout a nice, long belly rub; 98% described the border collie as “a good dog, a very good dog”; and 67% confirmed they wanted a big slobbery kiss from the pooch.

No respondents indicated they had established a strong rapport with the dog, though all expressed confidence they would soon be best friends with Scout.

While eyewitnesses said it briefly appeared that a Louisiana woman named Sonia Cattrall had gotten Scout to pursue her, it soon became clear the border collie had merely been chasing a squirrel and had not been engaging with any particular person.

At press time, tragedy struck as thousands were reportedly trampled to death, a stampede having ensued when all 340 million Americans frantically scrambled toward Scout to wave goodbye after the dog’s owner called him to her car.

"Pentagon Warns China Developing Love, The Greatest Weapon Of All",https://theonion.com/pentagon-warns-china-developing-love-the-greatest-weapon-of-all/,The Onion,,2025-01-27T11:04:59-06:00,"ARLINGTON, VA—In a high-level alert that revealed a geo-political rival of the United States could soon become the first nation capable of wielding the most powerful force in the universe, the Pentagon warned Friday that China was actively developing love, the greatest weapon of all.

The alert, issued to the American public and top U.S. allies, stated that China had made significant advances in love, a transcendent source of strength that ultimately triumphs over any defenses an enemy might try to erect against it. Weapons experts confirmed that if it were unleashed, the all-consuming feeling could strike the hearts of billions throughout Asia and the Pacific, even reaching the West Coast of the United States.

“Our assessments indicate love is stronger than any technology possessed by the U.S. military,” said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, pledging to work with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other regional partners to stop China from harnessing the invincible cosmic force that always emerges victorious. “Intelligence estimates suggest the program is in its final stages, so we must act quickly or love will overwhelm us and we will feel compelled to surrender to it.”

“If China succeeds, it will have the power to remake the global order by spreading universal love and understanding to every corner of the world,” Austin added.

Nations have vied for years to develop love, knowing it would provide their arsenals with a weapon that could overcome anyone or anything it encountered. According to sources within the Pentagon who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Defense Department’s own 10-year, $750 billion effort has failed to produce an abundance of love, bringing it no closer than it was a decade ago to equipping the military with a profound sense of devotion to one’s fellow human beings.

China is believed to have put similar resources into its far more successful program, with surveillance reports indicating that by 2030 the nation will have obtained an emotion that can create a profound sense of oneness with the universe. Previously, U.S. military analysts had questioned whether China possessed the emotional vulnerability necessary to develop love, believing it was still several decades away from acquiring a feeling so expansive it knows no bounds and flows outward into every aspect of existence.

In 2019, the U.N. issued sanctions after it found evidence of China’s intent to open itself up to love’s embrace, but inspectors reportedly underestimated just how quickly the smallest seed of tenderness could flourish into a garden of eternal love. Today, international observers expressed concerns that if the weapon were used, the world would see a fallout of hundreds or even thousands of years in which love would endure all things.

“It is clearly a show of strength by China to love like its heart has never been broken,” said Daniel Feng, an expert on Sino-American relations at Georgetown University, noting that China’s ultimate goal was to assert its right as a sovereign nation to love freely and unselfishly by letting go of fears and expectations. “Quite frankly, no one can escape the power of love, and China knows it. By putting their hearts on the line, they are signaling that at any given moment they could shower the United States with a love so fierce it would leave their international rival unrecognizable afterward.”

“So what should the Pentagon do now?” he continued. “With new theories suggesting it has the potential to be far, far stronger than love, America’s best strategy may be developing the technology to harness the power of mild annoyance.”

If she doesn’t get it right away, though, just move on to the next woman you see. It doesn’t matter if she’s just out walking her dog in the park, completely alone, or even standing at the altar with her betrothed. Eventually, one of these women will wake up to the fact that they’re with a total dud and could do way, way better.” Researchers added that if the woman responded affirmatively to the request, it was important to stare blankly back at her, shake one’s head in confusion, and then slowly walk home.

These days, though, we know that’s not the case, particularly for those who are nursing or pregnant. These labels will ensure that Americans understand they are putting their health at stake when they set off a few fusion bombs during a night out.” Murthy added that California had already been applying such labels for decades and had seen a marked decline in nuclear bomb users.

Obviously, we’re not saying to gobble up every sticky bun you find nestled ominously in the branches of a sycamore tree, but in moderation, trails of sweets can absolutely be part of an overall healthy diet.” The nutritionists also noted that bog crones with high cholesterol levels are known to fatten up their victims two belt sizes before eating them.

Chan School of Public Health found that only one in four Americans can get a motherfuckin’ “hell yeah.” “It’s no secret that peer enthusiasm is harder to come by than it was in previous decades, but even then, we were shocked to find a full 75% of Americans could only get a half-hearted ‘nice’ for situations that would have had people raising the motherfuckin’ roof just a decade ago,” said the study’s lead author, Professor Jessica Landers, adding that weak-ass responses like “okay” and “whatever” had exploded in frequency while “hell yeah” equivalents such as “BOOYAH” and “let’s fucking go” showed similar scarcity. “These findings are deeply troubling. As recently as the 1990s, Americans could reliably expect to not only get a motherfuckin’ ‘hell yeah’ from their homies, but also get a little skin up top. Now they’re being met with eye rolls and awkward silences, and for many, a ‘hell yeah’ is out of reach no matter how hard they beg their buddies not to leave a motherfucka hangin’.” Landers went on to urge policymakers to at least give her a “damn dude, that sucks.”

This ancient mystery can be neatly explained by a few simple machines and the intense physical labor of tens of thousands of invading alien troops.” Going on to acknowledge the genuine achievements of ancient Egyptians, Egerton noted that these Bronze Age humans had succeeded in using gravity cannons and proton rays to build the Great Sphinx in a single afternoon.

They’ll just be doing it without that irresistibly sweet Duracell taste.” Reached for further comment, Duracell officials confirmed the company had no plans to discontinue its popular 9-volt Cheese-Blasted batteries.

Sure, some of their stained glass bubblers are pretty dope, but do we really need so many of them? Besides, you can already get grinders and lighters and shit at the Vatican gift shop.” The Supreme Pontiff was later spotted stepping out of The Virgin Mary’s Smoke Shack with a fresh pack of rolling papers.

Surgeon General: ‘You Are Supposed To Be Able To Button Your Pants’,https://theonion.com/surgeon-general-you-are-supposed-to-be-able-to-button-your-pants/,The Onion,,2024-12-26T07:00:00-06:00,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the fasteners commonly found on most trousers were not merely ornamental, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory to the American public Thursday in which he clarified that people were supposed to be able to button their pants. “It should be a smooth effortless action that involves no protracted struggle to connect the two sides of the garment’s waist,” said Murthy, who added that buttoning your pants only to moments later have a seam rip or a button fly off still fell short of the government’s recommended clothing standards. “Leaving your shirt untucked so no one can tell that your pants are not buttoned or declaring that all your pants shrunk several sizes in the dryer are also unacceptable solutions. In addition, pants are meant to accommodate basic inhalation and exhalation, so you should be capable of taking a deep breath while wearing them.” At press time, the surgeon general’s office had received thousands of complaints about pants, and a visibly exasperated Murthy told Americans to just forget about his advisory and go buy themselves a nice pair of elastic jeggings.

It also really grosses me out thinking of them with, like, a butch buzz cut and muscles. It should be up to each individual servicewoman to decide whether she wants to be deployed to the front lines and turned into a total uggo. If not, there’s certainly a lot of room for them to look like absolute bombshells dressed as Army nurses.” Hegseth went on to suggest his mind might be changed if the military dress code were amended to require female soldiers to wear only a camouflage bra and panties on the battlefield.
