Marine Le Pen tells Paris rally her conviction is a 'witch hunt',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dg90l7ymlo,BBC,Jack Burgess,2025-04-06T16:45:18.616Z,"France's far-right National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen has called a court ruling banning her from running for office for five years a ""witch hunt"".

""I won't give up,"" she told thousands of flag-waving supporters in Place Vauban, close to the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Sunday.

She was on Monday found guilty of helping to embezzle €2.9m (£2.5m) of EU funds between 2004 and 2016 for use by her party. Le Pen has appealed.

At the rally on Sunday she claimed the ruling was a ""political decision"", adding: ""We are not asking to be above the law, but to not be below the law.""

Bardella, the president of the RN party, told the rally on Sunday that the court ruling was ""a direct attack on democracy and a wound to millions of patriotic French people"".

He said he did not want to ""discredit all judges"" but claimed that the judgement against Le Pen was aimed at ""eliminating her from the presidential race"" in 2027.

In reply on Sunday Gabriel Attal, the head of French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist Renaissance party, responded by saying ""you steal, you pay"".

Attal also denounced ""unprecedented interference"" in France's affairs, pointing to support for Le Pen from several right-wing leaders, including Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungary's PM Viktor Orban.

US President Donald Trump called her conviction a ""very big deal"".

A poll by BFMTV after Monday's ruling showed that many people in France believe that justice was service in the Le Pen case without bias - 57% according to the poll.

The Paris Court of Appeal said on Tuesday it should be able to provide a decision on the case by the summer of 2026 - several months before the 2027 presidential election.

Le Pen was gearing up to run for the presidency for a fourth time and had a good chance of winning.

On top of the ban on running for public office, Le Pen was also handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and four-year prison sentence, of which two years will be suspended.

This will not apply until the appeals process is exhausted, which could take several years.

RN spokesperson Laurent Jacobelli said that although the party would fight to have Le Pen as candidate, its 29-year-old president, Bardella, was ""the most naturally legitimate"" alternative.

Bardella has steered clear of being drawn into the discussion at this stage, refusing to say whether he was National Rally's ""plan B"" and saying after the ruling that the French should be ""outraged"" by the sentence.

However, a poll published a day before Le Pen was sentenced showed that around 60% of RN voters would back Bardella over Le Pen at the presidential election if he were to run.

France's President Macron is not entitled to stand for another term at the next presidential election.

A Minecraft Movie storms box office despite lukewarm reviews,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy018lm793o,BBC,Noor Nanji,2025-04-06T17:24:42.195Z,"A Minecraft Movie has proven to be a box office success, bringing in an estimated $300m (£233m) globally during its opening weekend.

The film, based on the wildly popular video game, was heavily delayed but finally hit the big screen on Friday.

It boasts a star-studded cast including Jason Momoa, Jack Black and Jennifer Coolidge.

The estimates place the film's earnings well above its reported production budget of $150m.

Around half of the film's global takings came from North America, according to EntTelligence.

The box office numbers come despite reviews for the film being mostly underwhelming.

The Telegraphawarded it two stars, saying the charm of the video game was “nowhere to be found”, while the Guardiangave it just one star, saying it has “a cobbled-together feel”.

It does not appear to have stopped families showing up in force to see it.

""It has definitely overperformed all industry projections,"" said Steve Buck, chief strategy officer at EntTelligence, which said the film had enjoyed a late ticket surge.

He said the film ""hit with all audiences"", with around a quarter of those going to see it being under the age of 13, and more than half being male.

""When dads like a family film, that's a good thing,"" he told BBC News.

""It's the largest domestic opening of 2025, and the largest for Warner Bros since 2023,"" he added.

Minecraft is one of the world's best selling video games (more than 300 million copies and counting,according to Statista).

The film tells the story of four misfits who are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld – the place where all players start in Minecraft.

There has been a long history of game-to-film flops. But others, such as Sonic and The Super Mario Bros Movie, were massive hits.

In press notes circulated ahead of the film's release, Black, 55, acknowledged there was a lot of pressure to deliver for fans of the blocky world.

""This game has been loved by millions and millions all over the world for years now, and I think this movie is a big deal for a lot of people, because now it's generational,"" he said.

Why men in England are more likely to die prematurely than women,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywrl5460jo,BBC,Nick Triggle,2025-04-06T00:40:30.847Z,"This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health – and what can be done about it?

Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.

""I was on the first floor,"" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. ""The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.""

The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health – a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.



In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.

These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and arenearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.

Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.

He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. ""Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?""

He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing ""it's much more complex than that.""

He says there are biological reasons – the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.

Prof White says: ""Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally – many go years without seeing a health professional.

""It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.""

Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.

""In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.""

But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest – a larger gap than is seen for women – and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.

""You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,"" he says. ""The way health services are designed isn't working for men.""

NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.

""Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.""

Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.

But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.

He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.

Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.

""How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them – they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,"" says Prof White.

Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.

But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. ""Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.""

He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.

Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.

""It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.""

Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.

The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.

Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations – something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help ""shine a spotlight"" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 – that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.

But he also wants it to act as a ""wake-up call"" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.

""Look at your waist size – if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.

""Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.""

Israel changes account of Gaza medic killings after video showed deadly attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0xp969n69o,BBC,Dan Johnson,2025-04-06T10:33:25.755Z,"Israel's army has admitted its soldiers made mistakes overthe killing of 15 emergency workersin southern Gaza on 23 March.

The convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck from Gaza's Civil Defence came under fire near Rafah.

Israel originally claimed troops opened fire because the convoy approached ""suspiciously"" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. It said movement of the vehicles had not been previously co-ordinated or agreed with the army.

Mobile phone footage, filmed by one of the paramedics who was killed, showed the vehicles did have lights on as they answered a call to help wounded people.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas - but has so far provided no evidence. It admits they were unarmed when the soldiers opened fire.

The mobile video, originally shared by the New York Times, shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when, without warning, shooting begins just before dawn.

The footage continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic, named as Refat Radwan, heard saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles.

An IDF official briefed journalists on Saturday evening, saying the soldiers had earlier fired on a car containing three Hamas members.

When the ambulances responded and approached the area, aerial surveillance monitors informed the soldiers on the ground of the convoy ""advancing suspiciously"".

When the ambulances stopped beside the Hamas car, the soldiers assumed they were under threat and opened fire, despite no evidence any of the emergency team was armed.

Israel has admitted its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.

The video footage shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wore reflective hi-vis uniform.

The soldiers buried the bodies of the 15 dead workers in sand to protect them from wild animals, the official said, claiming the vehicles were moved and buried the following day to clear the road.

They were not uncovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot.

When an aid team found the bodies they also discovered Refat Radwan's mobile phone containing footage of the incident.

The Israeli military official denied any of the medics were handcuffed before they died and said they were not executed at close range, as some reports had suggested.

Earlier this week,a surviving paramedic told the BBC the ambulances had their lights onand denied his colleagues were linked with any militant group.

The IDF promised a ""thorough examination"" of the incident, saying it would ""understand the sequence of events and the handling of the situation"".

The Red Crescent and many other international organisations are calling for an independent investigation.

Israel renewed its aerial bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of a ceasefire deal came to an end and negotiations on a second phase stalled.

More than 1,200 people have since been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

More than 50,600 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.

Two UK MPs 'astounded' after being denied entry to Israel,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9133z2v30o,BBC,Aleks Phillips & Ruth Comerford,2025-04-06T11:04:41.265Z,"Two Labour MPs say they are ""astounded"" to have been denied entry to Israel while on a trip to visit the occupied West Bank.

Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang said it was ""vital"" parliamentarians were able to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory first-hand.

They were refused entry because they intended to ""spread hate speech"" against Israel, the nation's population and immigration authority said.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticised Israeli authorities, describing the move as ""unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning"".

ButConservative leader Kemi Badenoch said Israel had a right to ""control its borders"", adding it was ""significant"" there were Labour MPs other countries did not want to let in.

Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, and Mohamed, the MP for Sheffield Central, flew to Israel from London Luton Airport with two aides on Saturday afternoon.

The Israeli immigration authority said Interior Minister Moshe Arbel denied entry to all four passengers after they were questioned. It accused them of travelling to ""document the security forces"".

The Israeli embassy in London said in a statement on Saturday that the country ""will not allow the entry of individuals or entities that act against the state and its citizens"".

It said Mohamed and Yang had ""accused Israel of false claims"" and were ""actively involved in promoting sanctions against Israeli ministers"".

It also said they had supported campaigns aimed at boycotting the country ""at a time when Israel is at war and under attack on seven fronts"".

The UK Foreign Office said the group was part of a parliamentary delegation. However, Israel's immigration authority said the delegation had not been acknowledged by an Israeli official.

The Israeli embassy said the MPs ""were offered hotel accommodation, which they declined"" and the cost of their return flight to the UK was covered.

Israel's Interior Ministry said the MPs left the country early on Sunday.

Mohamed and Yang said their trip had been organised with UK charities that had ""over a decade of experience in taking parliamentary delegations"".

""We are two, out of scores of MPs, who have spoken out in Parliament in recent months on the Israel-Palestine conflict and the importance of complying with international humanitarian law,"" the MPs said in a joint statement.

""Parliamentarians should feel free to speak truthful in the House of Commons, without fear of being targeted.""

Lammy said the Foreign Office had been in touch with both MPs to offer support, adding: ""I have made clear to my counterparts in the Israeli government that this is no way to treat British parliamentarians.""

The Council for Arab-British Understanding and Medical Aid for Palestinians - the latter of which is a registered UK charity - said in a joint statement that they had organised the trip.

""This visit was part of that long-standing programme,"" they said.

""When questioned, the group was clear, open and transparent about the aims and objectives of the visit, which included visiting a range of projects run by humanitarian and development organisations operating in the West Bank.

""The group had informed the UK consul general in Jerusalem of their visit and was planning to meet with them as part of the itinerary.""

Both Yang and Mohamed - who were first elected in 2024 - have made several interventions on the Israel-Hamas conflict in Parliament.

In February, Mohamed initiated a cross-party letter, signed by 61 MPs and lords, calling for a ban on goods from Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, citing an opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ).

She has also criticised Israel for withholding humanitarian aid from Gaza, telling the House of Commons in October that international law ""prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare"", and has mentioned humanitarian organisations' claims of ""ethnic cleansing"" in Gaza.

In January, Yang spoke in favour of bringing sanctions against Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, after they suggested building Israeli settlements in northern Gaza to encourage Palestinians to leave.

She has also highlighted the dangerous conditions journalists and medical professionals face while in the Palestinian territory.

When asked about Israel's decision, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that countries ""should be able to control their borders"".

""What I think is shocking is that we have MPs in Labour [who] other countries won't allow through,"" Badenoch said. ""I think that's very significant.""



Her comments were rebuffed by Emily Thornberry, the Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who described Yang and Mohamed as ""highly respected parliamentarians"" and ""potential leaders"".

""Israel is badly advised to try and alienate them, to humiliate them and to treat them in this way,"" she told the programme.

""I think that it's an insult to Britain and I think it's an insult to Parliament.""

Sir Ed Davey accused Badenoch of ""yet another complete shocker"".

The Liberal Democrat leader said she ""has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel"".

Lammy called Badenoch's comments ""disgraceful"", asking her: ""Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?""

During the war in Gaza, there have been protests, violent incidents and raids by Israeli forces in the West Bank. Hundreds of deaths have been reported there.

Israeli troops have been engaged in an extended operation in the occupied Palestinian territory, where two Palestinians were killed on Friday.

The current war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages back to Gaza.

Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 50,000 people have been killed. It said 1,309 people have died since a ceasefire ended on 18 March.

Lammy said: ""The UK government's focus remains securing a return to the ceasefire and negotiations to stop the bloodshed, free the hostages and end the conflict in Gaza.""

Second child dies of measles as Texas outbreak worsens,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg2xyyj9w5o,BBC,Madeline Halpert,2025-04-06T16:21:53.109Z,"A second child has died from measles as an outbreak of the the highly contagious virus continues to grow in western Texas.

The school-aged child was not vaccinated, had no underlying health conditions and was in hospital suffering complications from measles, Aaron Davis, the vice president of UMC Health System, told the BBC.

Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has faced a backlash over his handling of the outbreak, will reportedly head to Texas this week in the wake of the death.

The state reported more than 480 cases of measles this year as of Friday, a jump from 420 earlier in the week. The outbreak has extended to neighbouring states.

""This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination,"" Mr Davis said in a statement. ""Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, particularly for those who are unvaccinated.""

The child - an eight-year-old girl - died early on Thursday of ""measles pulmonary failure"", according to theNew York Times, which was the first to report after obtaining hospital records.

The BBC has contacted the state health department and the US Department of Health and Human Services for confirmation. Both agencies did not list the death in their case counts on Friday.

In February, an unvaccinated six-year-old girl in the local Mennonite community was the first child to die of measles in the US in a decade. In March, an unvaccinated man died in New Mexico after contracting the virus, though his cause of death is still under investigation.

The US has recorded more than 600 cases of measles this year, many related to the outbreak that began in western Texas. Cases in New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas are likely linked to the original outbreak, public health experts say.

Nearly all the cases are in unvaccinated people.

The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.

The US declared measles eliminated from the country in 2000. But outbreaks have grown since then with a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment.

Two shots of the immunization - proven safe - are 97% effective at preventing the virus and reduce severe infections. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots.

The outbreak originated in a religious community that strongly rejects vaccines. Local health officials in western Texas have told the BBC they have seen limited progress in attempts to improve vaccination rates.

Meanwhile, Kennedy's response to the worsening outbreaks has been muted.

At first, as cases began to spiral, he described the situation as ""not unusual"". He changed his tune after the first child measles death, but stopped short of recommending that parents vaccinate their children. He instead encouraged them to talk to their doctors about the shot, language public health experts have criticized.

The vaccine sceptic has also at times promoted Vitamin A as a treatment for measles, which doctors say should only be provided in certain cases under the guidance of a physician.

In Lubbock, Covenant Children's Hospital has treated several children for Vitamin A toxicity after they were sent to the hospital for measles complications.

Anti-Trump protests held in cities across the US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz79ewg193ro,BBC,"Robin Levinson King in Boston, Jenna Moon in Washington DC & Bernd Debusmann Jr in Florida",2025-04-05T22:31:10.981Z,"Crowds of protesters gathered in cities across the US on Saturday to denounce President Trump, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January.

The ""Hands Off"" protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities.

Protesters cited grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues.

Coming days after Trump's announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin.

In Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings.

Law student Katie Smith told BBC News that she was motivated by Turkish international studentRumeysa Ozturk, whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month.

""You can stand up today or you can be taken later,"" she said, adding: ""I'm not usually a protest girlie.""

In London, protesters held signs reading, ""WTAF America?"", ""Stop hurting people"" and ""He's an idiot"".

They chanted ""hands off Canada"", ""hands off Greenland"" and ""hands off Ukraine"", referencing Trump's changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest inannexingCanadaandGreenland. He also got intoa public disputewith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled tonegotiate a peace dealbetween Ukraine and Russia.

In Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump's administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce.

Florida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the ""billionaire takeover of our government"".

""When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,"" he shouted.

The protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but withslimmer margins than they had hoped. Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate byalmost 10 percentage points.

In both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration's policies and Elon Musk's influence.

Some polls show approval ratings for President Trump to be slipping slightly.

One Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week found that his approval rating had dropped to 43%, its lowest point since Trump began his second term in January. When he was inaugurated on 20 January, his approval rating was 47%.

The same poll found that 37% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 30% approve of his strategy to address the cost of living in the US.

Another recent poll, from Harvard Caps/Harris, found that 49% of registered voters approve of Trump's performance in office, down from 52% last month. The same poll, however, found that 54% of voters believe he is doing a better job than Joe Biden did as president.

One protester in Washington named Theresa told the BBC that she was there because ""we're losing our democratic rights"".

""I'm very concerned about the cuts they're making to the federal government,"" she said, adding that she is also concerned about retirement and education benefits.

Asked if she thought Trump was receiving the protesters' message, she said: ""Well, let's see. [Trump has] been golfing just about every day.""

Trump held no public events on Saturday, and spent the day golfing at a resort he owns in Florida. He was scheduled to play golf again on Sunday.

The White House released a statement defending Trump's positions, saying he would continue to protect programs such as Medicare and pointing to Democrats as the threat.

""President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.""

One of Trump's top immigration advisors, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Saturday that protesters held a rally outside of his New York home, but that he was in Washington at the time.

""They can protest a vacant house all they want,"" Homan said, adding that their presence ""tied up"" law enforcement and prevented officials from seeing to more important tasks.

""Protests and rallies, they don't mean anything,"" Homan continued.

""So go ahead and exercise your first amendment [free speech] rights. It's not going to change the facts of the case.""

Carmakers mull action over tariffs as JLR pauses car exports to US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0zr0p77m0o,BBC,Zahra Fatima,2025-04-06T13:17:20.440Z,"Jaguar Land Rover has announced it will ""pause"" all shipments to the US as it works to ""address the new trading terms"" after tariffs were imposed earlier this week.

A 25% levy on car imports came into force on Thursday, one of several measures announced by US President Donald Trump which have sent shockwaves through global supply chains.

The US is the second largest export market for the UK's car industry, after the European Union.

In a statement, a Jaguar Land Rover spokesperson said the company was ""taking some short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans"".

The Coventry-based car manufacturer - which also has sites in Solihull and Wolverhampton - said the US is an ""important market for JLR's luxury brands"".

More cars are exported to the US from the UK than any other goods. In a 12-month period up to the end of the third quarter of 2024, the trade was worth £8.3bn, according to theUK trade department.

An initial wave of tariffs on cars came into effect from 3 April, with import taxes on auto parts due to follow next month.

Car maker Nissan is thinking about moving some of its production of US-bound vehicles from Japan to the US as early as this summer, financial newspaper Nikkei has reported.

Earlier this week Nissan said it would keep two production shifts at its plant in Tennessee, after announcing plans to scale back operations there in January.

Meanwhile, carmaker Stellantis has said it willtemporarily shut down its assembly plant in Windsor, a Canadian city on the US border, next week due to the new tariffs.

The United Auto Workers union - which represents those working in car manufacturing in the United States and southern Ontario, Canada - has applauded the introduction of tariffs, saying the move ""signals a return to policies that prioritise the workers who build this country, rather than the greed of ruthless corporations""

A separate 10% tariff will be imposed on all other UK imports, with higher rates in place for some other major economies.

Globalstock markets have incurred heavy lossesin recent days as firms grapple with how to adapt to the new trading environment.

The FTSE 100 - which measures the performance of the 100 leading firms listed on the London Stock Exchange - plummeted by 4.9% on Friday, its steepest fall since the start of the pandemic.

Exchanges in Germany and France also saw similar declines.

Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK will take a calm approach to the trade tariffs and has ruled out ""jumping into a trade war"".

He warned ""the world as we knew it has gone"" but said he was prepared to use industrial policy to ""shelter British business from the storm"".

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Keir said he will continue to seek a trade deal with the US to avoid some tariffs, but mooted state intervention to protect the national interest.

Sir Keir is holding talks with other European leaders to discuss how to respond to the White House's trade moves.

The prime minister spoke to his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, the first of several discussions planned between Sir Keir and European leaders over the weekend.

Downing Street said Sir Keir and Macron had agreed ""a trade war was in nobody's interest"" but ""nothing should be off the table"".

Zimbabwe to scrap tariffs on US goods to build 'positive' ties with Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xqel9l18o,BBC,Farouk Chothia,2025-04-06T13:30:11.852Z,"Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has announced he will suspend tariffs on goods imported from the US in an attempt to build a ""positive relationship"" with President Donald Trump's administration.

The move comes days after Trump imposed 18% tariffs on Zimbabwean exports to the US.

""This measure is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States,"" Mnangagwa said on X.

Zimbabwe has had strained diplomatic relations with the US since it adopted a controversial land policy about 25 years ago, and because of its poor human rights record.



Trade between the two countries amounted to only $111.6m (£86.6m) in 2024,US government data shows.



Follow live: Global leaders try to soften tariffs impact



The US exported goods worth $43.8m to Zimbabwe in 2024, up 10.6% from the previous year, while imports were down 41% to  $67.8m.

Zimbabwean political analyst Tendai Mbanje told AFP news agency that the decision would not result in substantial economic benefits for Zimbabwe and would would only benefit the US.

Prominent Zimbabwean journalist and government critic Hopewell Chin'ono said  the president appeared to be trying to ""appease"" the Trump administration.

Mnangawa possibly hopes that the administration would lift sanctions imposed on him, but it was a ""long shot"", he added on X.







The US first imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's government during the rule of Robert Mugabe after he introduced a land reform programme in 2000 that led to the seizure of white-owned farms, and because of repressive measures taken against the opposition.

The Biden administration in the US scrapped the sanctions in 2024, replacing them with targeted sanctions on 11 individuals - including Mnangagwa - for ""democratic backsliding, human rights abuses, and government corruption"".

Mnangagwa has previously denied the allegations, describing the sanctions as ""illegal and unjustified"".

Announcing his decision to waive tariffs on US imports, he said Zimbabwe's focus was on ""fostering amicable relations with all nations, and cultivating adversarial relationships with none"".

""This action underscores our commitment to a framework of equitable trade and enhanced bilateral cooperation,"" he added.

Chin'ono said that Mnangagwa is currently the chairman of the regional bloc SADC, and should be trying to forge a common response to the US rather than acting unilaterally.

""When countries face global economic shifts, coordinated responses offer better leverage and stability,"" he added.

Lesotho - another southern African state - was hit with 50% tariffs, the highest in the list released by Trump on Wednesday.

Its government said it would send a delegation to the US to negotiate a new deal, and it would look for new markets for its goods.

Zoo's tortoises become first-time parents... aged about 100,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrvlk8lnymo,BBC,Jack Burgess,2025-04-06T15:13:15.988Z,"A pair of critically endangered giant tortoises aged about 100 years old have become first-time parents at Philadelphia Zoo.

The zoo said this week it was  ""overjoyed"" at the arrival of four hatchlings from Abrazzo and Mommy, a pair Western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises.

The births were a ""first"" in the zoo's 150-plus-year history, it said, and Mommy - who arrived in 1932 - was the oldest known first-time mother of her species.

Western Santa Cruz Galapagos tortoises are critically endangered in the wild, and there are fewer than 50 kept in US zoos.

The first of Abrazzo and Mommy's eggs hatched on 27 February, and others quickly followed. The zoo's animal care team is monitoring others that could still hatch in the coming weeks.

The four hatchlings weigh between 70 and 80 grams.

They are being kept behind-the-scenes, inside Philadelphia Zoo's Reptile and Amphibian House, and are ""eating and growing appropriately"", the zoo said.

It is planning a public debut of the quartet on Wednesday 23 April, which is ""the 93rd anniversary of Mommy's arrival at the zoo"".

The hatchlings are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' breeding programme, aimed at the survival of species and genetic diversity.

""This is a significant milestone in the history of Philadelphia Zoo, and we couldn't be more excited to share this news with our city, region and the world,"" the zoo's president and CEO Jo-Elle Mogerman said in a statement.

""Mommy arrived at the zoo in 1932, meaning anyone that has visited the zoo for the last 92 years has likely seen her,"" Ms Mogerman said.

Abrazzo is a newer arrival, having moved to Philadelphia in 2020 after previously living at the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in South Carolina.

""Philadelphia Zoo's vision is that those hatchlings will be a part of a thriving population of Galapagos tortoises on our healthy planet 100 years from now,"" she added.

Manhunt in Germany after three bodies found,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0r5q0x4824o,BBC,Jessica Rawnsley,2025-04-06T11:26:12.793Z,"A manhunt is under way after three bodies were found in a residential building in a village in western Germany.

The suspect fled when officers arrived at the scene in Weitefeld, Westerwald, and is on the run, a police spokesperson told the German Press Agency.

Police advised residents in the surrounding area to stay at home, and warned people not to pick up hitchhikers, local media reported.

Details have not been released about those killed.

German outlet Bild reported that a special task force was on site and a  police helicopter is being used.

Weitefeld, which has about population of about 2,200, was cordoned off and vehicles entering and leaving are being checked.

A police spokesperson told Bild that an emergency call came at 3:45am local time (2.45am BST).

Local media reported that police said the incident happened in a family home and the three victims include two males and one female.

A police spokesman did not rule out that children were among the dead.

Weitefeld's mayor Karl-Heinz Kessler said he could never ""have imagined such an act"" in his small community.

""You know the people here in the village,"" he told Der Spiegel.

Kessler said a woman, a man and a teenage boy lived at the house.

No wigs please - the new rules shaking up beauty pageants,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w8r094k41o,BBC,Anita Nkonge,2025-04-06T00:08:11.014Z,"Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.

Contestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos - with very few choosing the natural look.

In more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marlène-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022 - looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.

Her victory was not only unusual in Ivory Coast but across the world, where Western beauty standards are often the desired look both for those entering contests and for the judges.

Changes are slowly creeping in - last December Angélique Angarni-Filopon, from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, made headlines when she was crowned Miss France, mainly because of her age - she is 34 - and she also sported short Afro hair.

But this year the organisers of the Ivorian competition are shaking things up right from the start.

Wigs, weaves and hair extensions have been banned from the preliminary stages of the competition, which are held in 13 cities across the country (as well as two abroad for those in the diaspora).

""We want the candidates to be natural - whether with braids or straightened hair, it should be their own. Beauty must be raw,"" Victor Yapobi, president of the Miss Ivory Coast organising committee, told the BBC.

Ivory Coast is the only African country enforcing the ban for a national competition.

Mr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look - for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.

""We decided this year to truly showcase the natural beauty of these young women,"" he said.

Other changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete - the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and - crucially - lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (£25) to $50.

""This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.""

When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.

""I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,"" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.

""This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.""

The move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.

As a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called ""protective style"", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.

This was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.

""I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,"" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.

""I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.""

The new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.

""Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,"" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.

""This year, I feel more confident being myself.""

Should the competition influence attitudes beyond the pageant world, it could have huge economic implications.

Wigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.

Ivory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.

""This rule is not good for us,"" Ange Sea, a 30-year-old hairdresser in Daloa, told the BBC.

""Many women love wigs. This will hurt our business and we make more money when working with wigs and weaves.""

At her salon, glue will be used to carefully attach wigs to make them look more natural and women will spend hours having weaves and extensions put in.

It shows how deeply engrained wig culture is in West Africa, despite a natural hair movement that has been gaining momentum among black women around the world over the last decade.

Natural hair products have become much more readily available and natural hair influencers proliferate on social media worldwide with advice on how to manage and style natural hair, which can be time-consuming.

It used to be considered unprofessional to wear one's hair naturally and it would have been extraordinary to see black female TV stars on screen or CEOs in the boardroom with natural hair.

According to Florence Edwige Nanga, a hair and scalp specialist in the main Ivorian city of Abidjan, this is often still the case in Ivory Coast.

""Turn on the TV [here], and you'll see almost every journalist wearing a wig,"" the trichologist told the BBC.

""These beauty enhancements are fashionable, but they can also cause problems - like alopecia or scalp infections,"" she warned.

With the preliminary rounds under way, arguments over whether pageants should be setting beauty rules or women should decide such things for themselves continues.

The outcome may be that there is more of an acceptance of both in Ivory Coast, allowing women to switch styles up - between natural hair and wigs and weaves.

Mr Yapobi said the feedback he had received over the new rules was ""extraordinary"" and clearly showed it was having an impact.

""Everyone congratulates us. Everyone, even from abroad. I receive emails and WhatsApp messages from everywhere congratulating us for wanting to return to our roots.""

He said no decision had been taken about whether the wig ban would apply to the 15 contestants who make it to the final of Miss Ivory Coast 2025.

This extravaganza will take place at a hotel in Abidjan at the end of June and will be broadcast on national TV.

""If it works, we'll continue and carry on this initiative in the years to come,"" Mr Yapobi said.

For Doria Koré, who went on to be named Miss Haut-Sassandra, her crown holds even more significance: ""Winning with natural hair shows the true beauty of African women.""

Ms Dali said she was walking away with something even more valuable - self-confidence: ""I didn't win, but I feel proud. This is who I am.""

"Next gen British snowboarder, 10, turning heads and making his name",https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cedy9j118v1o,BBC,,2025-04-06T06:21:55.294Z,"Riley Sharpe won all his events at the Brits in Mayrhofen, Austria

British freestyle skiing and snowboarding is already blessed with world beaters in Mia Brookes, Charlotte Bankes and Zoe Atkin.

But who could be the next generation superstar for Great Britain?

Riley Sharpe was the name on everyone's lips at the British Freeski and Snowboarding Championships, aka the Brits.

And for good reason.

The 10-year-old snowboarder swept the board, winning the overall slopestyle and big air titles - beating some athletes more than twice his age. He also took home the under-16 rail jam trophy and the under-12 snowboard cross title.

The last person under 12 to win a main title? That was Brookes, back in 2018, when she was 11. Still a teenager, she has gone on to become world champion, an X Games gold medallist and a World Cup overall crystal globe winner.

The Brits were being held in Mayrhofen, Austria, after a six-year hiatus for the full event because of the coronavirus pandemic.

His father James told BBC Sport: ""Riley amazes us every day with his hard work and dedication and it's great to see all that hard work pay off for him.

""Thank you to the Brits for putting on the competition to enable the best talent in the UK to showcase themselves. We can't wait to see how Riley progresses in the sport.""

Riley Sharpe (centre) with mum Jennifer and dad James

Sharpe has been snowboarding since the age of two - his ability soon became so evident that the family were advised to allow him to snowboard for a full season, rather than a week's holiday a year.

""We were told he had a gift and to give him a chance,"" James said, so they made the decision to support him and moved the family to France for the winter.

""He excelled faster than anyone expected. He is obsessed with it,"" James added.

He competed on the Swiss tour aged eight and won every competition in the under-11s category against other international snowboarders. This season, Sharpe claimed the under-12 title at the World Rookie Tour finals in Kaprun and is leading the Ziller Valley Rally - also in Austria - with one event to go.

John Weatherley, who coaches him alongside Barry Parker, said: ""You can tell he's special. He's got a lot of style and is like a sponge when he's learning anything new.""

To aid his training, the family are building a rail park at their property in the French ski resort of Avoriaz and split the winter season between France and the United States, where mum Jennifer was born.

""We were just casual snowboarders,"" Jennifer said. ""Now we chase the snow across the world!""

In the summer months, the family are back in Nantwich in Cheshire and Sharpe trains at the Chill Factore in Manchester and Tamworth Snowdome.

Brookes and her family live 10 miles away and Mia's mum Vicky has been advising the Sharpes on the number of competitions he should enter at his age - as well as keeping snowboarding fun.

Sharpe and Brookes, 18, have ridden together a number of times. Jennifer said: ""She's really good with him and understands because she's been on the same journey.""

Although Sharpe is eager to progress to major competitions as soon as possible, he will have to wait until he is 15 for World Cup events, and 16 for the Winter Olympics, which would mean being eligible for the 2034 Games.

There is no minimum age for the X Games, however, which is by invitation.

""Nothing scares me,"" Sharpe said. ""I can't wait for next season already. I want to keep pushing and showing what I can do.""

Why shoppers are snapping up 'stripes' products for eye-popping prices,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp315k7pgqro,BBC,Robin Levinson King,2025-04-06T04:58:18.872Z,"On a bustling weekday in Toronto, Shauna Daniels was out ""hunting for stripes"".

It's a term she uses for shopping for the iconic – and increasingly rare – coloured stripes that are emblematic of Canada's oldest corporation, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC).

Sales of HBC's striped merchandise – from handcrafted wool blankets to patio umbrellas – have skyrocketed since the company announced it would be liquidating all of its department stores nationwide.

On eBay, the blankets, which normally retailed for about C$300, were being sold for over C$1,000 ($710; £540).

The stripes have become ""a symbol and an emblem of a tremendous chapter for the country"", Ms Daniels told the BBC while browsing on her lunch break.

""It's emotional,"" she added, as she recalled going ice skating in the city centre as a child with her parents, and passing by the department store's window displays.

This HBC stripes fever has arrived amid a growing movement to ""buy Canadian"" in the face of tariffs from the United States, and a surge of national pride in response.

Sales of the merchandise have increased so much since news of the impending closures was announced that the company was able to make good on some of its debts - it owes almost  almost one billion dollars to creditors - and keep six stores from liquidating.

Still, 80 Hudson's Bay stores, as well as a handful of Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th stores in Canada have gone into liquidation sales.

It's a sorry fate for one of Canada's most recognisable brands.

Founded in 1670, HBC was granted a royal charter to control trade in parts of Canada. The company began trading woolen ""point"" blankets - made overseas in the Oxfordshire town of Witney - with local indigenous communities.

The blankets themselves were often striped with rich colours – indigo, red, canary yellow and emerald green, said to be popular during Queen Anne's reign, from 1702-1714.

That history – of colonialism and imperialism – has led some to critique the company's place in Canadiana. But the blanket's stripes endured, becoming a symbol of not just the the Hudson's Bay Company, but Canada's rugged past.

By the time the former British colony had become its own nation, HBC had pivoted from the no-longer booming fur trade, and had opened its first retail store in Winnipeg in 1881.

The company began manufacturing the blankets for mass retail in 1929, and soon the HBC stripes were appearing on a wide range of home décor. Toronto-based interior designer Kate Thornley-Hall has repurposed blankets into her own designs, from pillow cushions to ottomans.

""It's an enduring reminder of the pivotal role that the Hudson's Bay played in the development of our country,"" she told the BBC.

With branches in every major city, a Hudson's Bay department store became a major attraction. Filigreed stone facades made these stores not just a place to pick up necessities, but a destination for tourists and locals alike.

In 2008, private equity firm NRDC purchased the company, turning this quintessentially Canadian retailer American. But the company's fortunes soon took a downturn, as department stores began to lose ground to online shopping.

Retail analyst Bruce Winder told the BBC that the pandemic only accelerated this shift in consumer habits, leaving legacy retailers like Sears, HBC and the American mall struggling to retain shoppers.

""Canadians, if they want to save, they go to places like Amazon or Walmart or Dollarama,"" he said.

If they want to buy higher-end goods, they are more likely to go to a boutique or directly to a brand's website.

NRDC, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, also diverted its attention elsewhere, acquiring Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in 2024.

Soon, Hudson's Bay was struggling to pay its landlords and suppliers. Trump's looming tariffs also caused its creditors to be concerned about the company's ability to pay them back, Mr Winder said.

Some shoppers hope that the resurgence in demand for the blankets and other stripes merchandise will give the brand a second life.

""I hope that people will again be drawn to shopping and luxury, rather than online fast fashion,"" Ms Thornley-Hall said.

Analyst Mr Winder thinks that, while the return of the department store is unlikely, there could be space for the company to license its iconic stripes to another company, or open up small, HBC-branded boutiques.

""I think it tells us that the brand has some affinity in Canada, albeit probably with select items, based on their heritage,"" he said.

"India's rivers are home to 6,000 dolphins - but they are in trouble",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg70pprzegyo,BBC,Cherylann Mollan,2025-04-06T00:21:21.316Z,"India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.

But these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.

These are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.

A new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.

Both these dolphin species are classified as ""endangered"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins.

The origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called ""living fossils"", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists.

When the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.

Experts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.

Conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.

In 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.

However, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.

Dolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.

Nachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble.

Under Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as ""hunting"" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines.

River cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.

""There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,"" conservationist Ravindra Kumar SinhatoldThe Guardian newspaper.

Mr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.

River dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.

Their poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.

But Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. ""Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,"" he says.

""This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.""

When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.

""I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,"" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.

""This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.""

The move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.

As a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called ""protective style"", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.

This was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.

""I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,"" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.

""I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.""

The new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.

""Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,"" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.

""This year, I feel more confident being myself.""

Should the competition influence attitudes beyond the pageant world, it could have huge economic implications.

Wigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.

Ivory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.

""This rule is not good for us,"" Ange Sea, a 30-year-old hairdresser in Daloa, told the BBC.

""Many women love wigs. This will hurt our business and we make more money when working with wigs and weaves.""

At her salon, glue will be used to carefully attach wigs to make them look more natural and women will spend hours having weaves and extensions put in.

It shows how deeply engrained wig culture is in West Africa, despite a natural hair movement that has been gaining momentum among black women around the world over the last decade.

Natural hair products have become much more readily available and natural hair influencers proliferate on social media worldwide with advice on how to manage and style natural hair, which can be time-consuming.

It used to be considered unprofessional to wear one's hair naturally and it would have been extraordinary to see black female TV stars on screen or CEOs in the boardroom with natural hair.

According to Florence Edwige Nanga, a hair and scalp specialist in the main Ivorian city of Abidjan, this is often still the case in Ivory Coast.

""Turn on the TV [here], and you'll see almost every journalist wearing a wig,"" the trichologist told the BBC.

""These beauty enhancements are fashionable, but they can also cause problems - like alopecia or scalp infections,"" she warned.

With the preliminary rounds under way, arguments over whether pageants should be setting beauty rules or women should decide such things for themselves continues.

The outcome may be that there is more of an acceptance of both in Ivory Coast, allowing women to switch styles up - between natural hair and wigs and weaves.

Mr Yapobi said the feedback he had received over the new rules was ""extraordinary"" and clearly showed it was having an impact.

""Everyone congratulates us. Everyone, even from abroad. I receive emails and WhatsApp messages from everywhere congratulating us for wanting to return to our roots.""

He said no decision had been taken about whether the wig ban would apply to the 15 contestants who make it to the final of Miss Ivory Coast 2025.

This extravaganza will take place at a hotel in Abidjan at the end of June and will be broadcast on national TV.

""If it works, we'll continue and carry on this initiative in the years to come,"" Mr Yapobi said.

For Doria Koré, who went on to be named Miss Haut-Sassandra, her crown holds even more significance: ""Winning with natural hair shows the true beauty of African women.""

Ms Dali said she was walking away with something even more valuable - self-confidence: ""I didn't win, but I feel proud. This is who I am.""

Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34nkj1kv2o,BBC,Faisal Islam,2025-04-05T23:59:04.833Z,"President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.

The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.

What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.

And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.

Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.

Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.



Follow live: US tariffs have global leaders scrambling



The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it ""great"" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.

On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.

There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.

Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.

Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.

But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.

It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.

The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first,complicated looking equationrevealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.

In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. ""These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers… The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.""

This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition ""cheating"" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.

This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffingrarely visited islands only inhabited by penguinsmatter. It reveals the actual method.

The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.

While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.

There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.

The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (£216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.

Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.

There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that ""rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things"".

That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.

For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term ""China shock"".

In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, andso transforming the global economy.

Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of ""comparative advantage"". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.

Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.

Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this ""China shock"" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.

The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.

Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.

So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president'sclear message to foreign companiesis to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.

But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having ""raped and pillaged"" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.

The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.

The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.

Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.

The world's consumers have choices.

It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.

Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.

Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience ofTesla's sale slumpand Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.

These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.

The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.

In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.

This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.

Perhaps there is some substance to the theory thatthe real objective hereis to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.

For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.

'Thousands watch me clean my home each day': The women monetising their daily chores,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy69x9wl2no,BBC,Megan Davies,2025-04-06T06:03:41.821Z,"Like many parents, Carys Harding spends a lot of time cleaning up after her kids.

But unlike most, the 27-year-old mum-of-three is watched by thousands online as she scrubs, dusts and declutters her home, as part of a popular social media trend known as a ""reset"".

With more than 100k followers across TikTok and Instagram, Carys has become one of many full-time influencers who monetise their daily lives.

""I never thought for one minute that the routines and structure that I have in my life would be something people would be interested in,"" said Carys, from Swansea.

It was after having her second child in 2022 that Carys said she realised she needed to be ""another level of organised"", and began building an ""evening reset"" into her routine.

She said each reset involves spending 20 minutes ""whipping around"" the house, cleaning the surfaces, putting stuff away and getting ready for the next day after her children have gone to bed.

She films herself along the way before editing the videos into short reels which she shares on her social media platforms.

""I just love sharing things that are helping me, because being a mum is difficult,"" said Carys.

""You've got a lot on your plate, you've got a lot to think about.""

Carys said being relatable was important to her, adding that her intention was never to make others feel ""like less of a person"".

""I never want it to come across that I want to keep my house clean for any other reason than it makes my life easier,"" she said.

""Yes, take inspiration. Yes, use it to motivate you. But please don't look at [my content] and think less of yourself, because if that's happening, then I would suggest you turn away.""

Fellow influencer Emily Jones, from Ammanford, said she tried to be ""100% transparent"" when sharing time-saving cleaning tips with her more than 13k Instagram followers.

""It tends to be this daily thing of resetting the house, and cleaning and tidying,"" said the 32-year-old mum-of-two.

""I try and do stuff where if I've got half an hour or I've got an hour where the baby's napping, I'm like 'right, I'm just going to do half an hour' because to me that's what keeps it real and that's what's realistic.

""You can't clean all day. It's just impossible.

""I'm a mum. I'm trying to work at the same time. I've got two young kids. I've got all the things everybody else has going on in their lives.""

There are more than 11m posts on Instagram under the hashtag #cleaning and more than 2.6m for #reset.

With almost 2m followers across Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube, 30-year-old Roo Day, from Hertfordshire, is one of the most high-profile cleaning influencers in the UK.

Roo shares videos of what she calls ""one hour speed cleans"", where she sets herself a 60-minute timer and attempts to get as much cleaning done as possible.

""Genuinely to my core I would rather be spending the least amount of time cleaning possible, and I feel like people do also feel that way as well,"" said Roo.

Roo said the majority of cleaning social media content was created by women, but that a growing number of male influencers were getting involved too.

""I don't think it's mega empowering that I am doing all of this cleaning,"" she said.

""[But] it just so happens that the split in my household means that I do a little bit more of the cleaning, because I'm not out at a 9 to 5 job all day.

""If we're going to be talking about gender, it shouldn't just be women who are doing it.

""And there's so many male creators now that I watch. In fact, if I see a male and they're like 'reset with me', I'm locked in.

""I love the fact that it is still predominantly female, but a lot of men are getting into it now as well.""

Dr Stephanie Alice Baker, an associate professor in sociology at City St George's University of London, said cleaning was a role that women had ""typically"" occupied.

She said creating social media content based upon cleaning therefore offered ""a sense of control"".

""They can monetise something they'd traditionally have completed as unpaid labour.""

Dr Baker said that while lifestyle content was increasing in popularity, audience interest was not new.

""This type of content existed before social media, it's just that social media makes it a lot more accessible,"" she said.

""The mediums and the audiences have changed but the concerns around self-improvement have existed over generations.""

Dr Ceri Bradshaw, a psychologist at Swansea University, said there was a risk that people could be ""easily tricked"" by snappy, 60-second cleaning videos that in reality take hours of physical work.

""I think we're also easily tricked into thinking that we should be more like the people that we watch,"" she added.

But Dr Bradshaw said she understood the appeal of watching cleaning content.

""With the cleaning, you're effectively sort of fixing something that needs fixing and it's happening very, very quickly.

""It's quite soothing to the brain.""

"Next gen British snowboarder, 10, turning heads and making his name",https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cedy9j118v1o,BBC,,2025-04-06T06:21:55.294Z,"Riley Sharpe won all his events at the Brits in Mayrhofen, Austria

British freestyle skiing and snowboarding is already blessed with world beaters in Mia Brookes, Charlotte Bankes and Zoe Atkin.

But who could be the next generation superstar for Great Britain?

Riley Sharpe was the name on everyone's lips at the British Freeski and Snowboarding Championships, aka the Brits.

And for good reason.

The 10-year-old snowboarder swept the board, winning the overall slopestyle and big air titles - beating some athletes more than twice his age. He also took home the under-16 rail jam trophy and the under-12 snowboard cross title.

The last person under 12 to win a main title? That was Brookes, back in 2018, when she was 11. Still a teenager, she has gone on to become world champion, an X Games gold medallist and a World Cup overall crystal globe winner.

The Brits were being held in Mayrhofen, Austria, after a six-year hiatus for the full event because of the coronavirus pandemic.

His father James told BBC Sport: ""Riley amazes us every day with his hard work and dedication and it's great to see all that hard work pay off for him.

""Thank you to the Brits for putting on the competition to enable the best talent in the UK to showcase themselves. We can't wait to see how Riley progresses in the sport.""

Riley Sharpe (centre) with mum Jennifer and dad James

Sharpe has been snowboarding since the age of two - his ability soon became so evident that the family were advised to allow him to snowboard for a full season, rather than a week's holiday a year.

""We were told he had a gift and to give him a chance,"" James said, so they made the decision to support him and moved the family to France for the winter.

""He excelled faster than anyone expected. He is obsessed with it,"" James added.

He competed on the Swiss tour aged eight and won every competition in the under-11s category against other international snowboarders. This season, Sharpe claimed the under-12 title at the World Rookie Tour finals in Kaprun and is leading the Ziller Valley Rally - also in Austria - with one event to go.

John Weatherley, who coaches him alongside Barry Parker, said: ""You can tell he's special. He's got a lot of style and is like a sponge when he's learning anything new.""

To aid his training, the family are building a rail park at their property in the French ski resort of Avoriaz and split the winter season between France and the United States, where mum Jennifer was born.

""We were just casual snowboarders,"" Jennifer said. ""Now we chase the snow across the world!""

In the summer months, the family are back in Nantwich in Cheshire and Sharpe trains at the Chill Factore in Manchester and Tamworth Snowdome.

Brookes and her family live 10 miles away and Mia's mum Vicky has been advising the Sharpes on the number of competitions he should enter at his age - as well as keeping snowboarding fun.

Sharpe and Brookes, 18, have ridden together a number of times. Jennifer said: ""She's really good with him and understands because she's been on the same journey.""

Although Sharpe is eager to progress to major competitions as soon as possible, he will have to wait until he is 15 for World Cup events, and 16 for the Winter Olympics, which would mean being eligible for the 2034 Games.

There is no minimum age for the X Games, however, which is by invitation.

""Nothing scares me,"" Sharpe said. ""I can't wait for next season already. I want to keep pushing and showing what I can do.""

Starmer vows to protect UK businesses from 'storm',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89g7g5lx2ko,BBC,Ruth Comerford,2025-04-06T06:24:44.809Z,"The prime minister has said he is prepared to use industrial policy to ""shelter British business from the storm"" expected from US President Donald Trump's wave of tariffs.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Sir Keir Starmer said he will continue to seek a trade deal with the US to avoid some tariffs, but mooted state intervention to protect the national interest.

""Some people may feel uncomfortable about this – the idea the state should intervene directly to shape the market has often been derided,"" he said. ""But we simply cannot cling on to old sentiments when the world is turning this fast.""

The UK was among nations hit with a 10% ""baseline"" import duty this week.

In addition to the 10% tariffs, a 25% tariff has been put on UK car exports, as well as steel and aluminium products. Many nations will face muchhigher tariffsof up to 50%, starting on 9 April.

Trump has said his intervention was aimed at encouraging US consumers to buy more American goods and boost the domestic economy.

But the announcement - and retaliatory tariffs from countries such as China - led tostocks plunging more than 5%amid fears of a global recession.

Jaguar Land Roverannounced on Saturday it would ""pause"" all shipments to the USas it works to ""address the new trading terms"".

Sir Keir wrote: ""This week we will turbocharge plans that will improve our domestic competitiveness, so we're less exposed to these kinds of global shocks.

""We stand ready to use industrial policy to help shelter British business from the storm.""

The prime minister admitted some may feel ""uncomfortable"" with the government intervening in the economy, but said the UK could not ""cling to old sentiments when the world is turning this fast"".

He has not ruled out further tax rises in the autumn, but pointed out the government had resisted doing so in its Spring Statement.

An industrial strategy promised in Labour's election manifesto is due to be unveiled this summer. Elements of that could now be adapted and brought forward to aid UK firms.

In the Telegraph, Sir Keir reiterated the government's position that it would ""keep calm and fight for the best deal"" with the US, but said ""all options remain on the table"".

He added: ""I will only strike a deal if it is right for British business and the security of working people.""

Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has urged the prime minister to strike a ""deep and meaningful trade deal"" with the US, that ""delivers growth without compromising on standards"".

The UK exported nearly £60bn worth of goods to the US last year, mainly machinery, cars and pharmaceuticals.

On Wednesday, the government published a 400-page list of US goods it could include in any possible tariff response. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told MPs the government would consult with businesses on how retaliatory tariffs could affect them.

The list covers 27% of imports from the US - chosen because they would have a ""more limited impact"" on the UK economy, the Department for Business and Trade said.

Sir Keir said he would also seek to reduce trade barriers with other economies to limit the impact of US tariffs on UK exports.

Over the weekend, the prime minister spoke to several world leaders to discuss how to respond to the US tariffs.

In a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday, the pair agreed a trade war was ""in nobody's interests"" but ""nothing should be off the table"".

But both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say UK families and businesses will first feel the impact of theNational Insurance hike for employersthat takes effect today.

What Trump has done - and why it matters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qnd2x1nn3o,BBC,Jemma Crew,2025-04-03T20:12:47.832Z,"US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on goods from countries across the world, on what he called ""Liberation Day"".

He says the move will make America wealthy again, but economists warn that prices could rise for Americans and fears of a global trade war have grown.

Tariffs are taxes on goods from other countries. Companies bringing the goods into the country pay the amount, typically a percentage of the goods' value, to the government.

Trump announced a 10% ""baseline"" tariff on imports to the US. This is what the UK will face.

But 60 countries will be hit with higher rates of up to 50%, including Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh. Countries in the European Union face a 20% tariff. The tariffs are set to take effect in days.

Trump also confirmed previously announced tariffs on specific goods, including 25% on steel, aluminium and foreign-made cars.

Since the 1980s, Trump has strongly argued that the taxes can boost the US economy.

He believes they will encourage US consumers to buy more American goods, and increase the amount of tax raised. Trump also wants to reduce the gap between the value of US goods imported and exported.

The White House said other countries were taking advantage of the US by imposing their own high tariffs and other trade barriers. ""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,"" the US president said.

However, Trump is taking an enormous risk upon which he is staking his presidency, our North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher writes.

If successful, the move could reshape the global economic order. Trump promises that it will rebuild American manufacturing and make the country more self-reliant.

But it risks alienating allies and economists warn it could raise prices and threaten a global recession.

A messy global trade war looks inevitable, suggests the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam.

Trump's decision to take tariff revenues to a level beyond those seen during the 1930s will mean huge changes to world trade patterns, he says.

Economists say many companies are likely to pass the increased cost of imported goods onto their customers. They could also reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available - putting further pressure on prices.

To raise the revenue Trump is hoping for, US consumers are going to have to swallow rises and keep on buying items made in other countries in similar quantities, says the BBC's deputy economics editor Dharshini David.

And as she points out, history shows the frontline casualties tend to be consumers, due to reduced choice and higher prices.

Cars, lumber used to build houses, beer, whisky and tequila, and avocados are among the goods that could become more expensive.

Global stockmarkets fell and a series of world leaders condemned the measures.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said ""the consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe"".

EUcountries are finalising a response to the 25% steel and aluminium tariffs and could announce further measures.

The commission  has promised to protect European businesses, including Germany's car industry, Italy's luxury goods and France's wine producers.

Chinahas promised ""resolute countermeasures"", which are likely to hurt US companies trying to sell into the huge Chinese market.

However, Trump's tariffs may also benefit China by allowing President Xi Jinping to portray his country as a champion of free trade, the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell says.

UKPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the economy will be hurt by the latest tariffs but promised to react with ""cool and calm heads"".

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told MPs the government would look at how retaliatory tariff measures against US products could affect British firms.

Canada'sPrime Minister Mark Carney said the country will retaliate against US tariffs, ""with purpose and with force"", to protect workers and strength the economy.

On Thursday, he announced a 25% levy on all vehicles imported from the US that are not compliant with a current North American free trade deal.

The UK faces a 10% tariff on goods heading to the US but there's lots of uncertainty about what it could mean for the UK itself:

Prices could rise – or fall

Once tariffs are in place, the value of the dollar could strengthen. That might push up import costs for UK firms, which could mean higher prices for consumers.

But some economists say prices might actually drop at first. That's because firms that usually sell to the US might start sending their goods to countries like the UK instead – possibly leading to a surge of cheaper goods here.

Your job could be affected

Higher prices might lead workers to ask for bigger pay rises. If UK companies see their profits squeezed, job cuts could follow.

Interest rates could stay high

Rates are currently at 4.5%, and economists had expected two cuts this year. But if inflation rises because of higher prices, rates might stay higher for longer.

The chance of the US economy heading into a recession rose to 50% after Trump's announcement, according to former International Monetary Fund chief economist  Ken Rogoff.

Trump has previously refused to rule out the possibility of a recession.

There are worries that tariffs could affect US consumer spending - a massive part of the global economy.

In Asia, tariffs will ""break the business models of thousands of companies, factories, and possibly entire nations"", says our economics editor Faisal Islam.

How were the rates calculated?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gq72n7y1o,BBC,Ben Chu & Tom Edgington,2025-04-03T11:48:36.149Z,"US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on goods from most countries being imported into the US, with even higher rates for what he calls the ""worst offenders"".

But how exactly were these tariffs -  essentially taxes on imports - worked out? BBC Verify has been looking at the calculations behind the numbers.

When Trump presented a giant cardboard chart detailing the tariffs in the White House Rose Garden it was initially assumed that the charges were based on a combination of existing tariffs and other trade barriers (like regulations).

But later,the White House published what might look like a complicated mathematical formula.

But if you unpick the formula above it boils down to simple maths: take the trade deficit for the US in goods with a particular country, divide that by the total goods imports from that country and then divide that number by two.

A trade deficit occurs when a country buys (imports) more physical products from other countries than it sells (exports) to them.

For example, the US buys more goods from China than it sells to them - there is a goods deficit of $295bn. The total amount of goods it buys from China is $440bn.

Dividing 295 by 440 gets you to 67% and you divide that by two and round up. Therefore the tariff imposed on China is 34%.

Similarly, when it applied to the EU, the White House's formula resulted in a 20% tariff.

Many commentators have pointed out that these tariffs are not reciprocal.

Reciprocal would mean they were based on what countries already charge the US in the form of existing tariffs, plus non-tariff barriers (things like regulations that drive up costs).

But the White House's official methodology document makes clear that they have not calculated this for all the countries on which they have imposed tariffs.

Instead the tariff rate was calculated on the basis that it would eliminate the US's goods trade deficit with each country.

Trump has broken away from the formula in imposing tariffs on countries that buy more goods from the US than they sell to it.

For example the US does not currently run goods trade deficit with the UK. Yet the UK has been hit with a 10% tariff.

In total, more than 100 countries are covered by the new tariff regime.

Trump believes the US is getting a bad deal in global trade. In his view, other countries flood US markets with cheap goods - which hurts US companies and costs jobs. At the same time, these countries are putting up barriers that make US products less competitive abroad.

So by using tariffs to eliminate trade deficits, Trump hopes to revive US manufacturing and protect jobs.

But will this new tariff regime achieve the desired outcome?

BBC Verify has spoken to a number of economists. The overwhelming view is that while the tariffs might reduce the goods deficit between the US and individual countries, they will not reduce the overall deficit between the US and rest of the world.

""Yes, it will reduce bilateral trade deficits between the US and these countries. But there will obviously be lots of broader impacts that are not captured in the calculation"", says Professor Jonathan Portes of King's College, London.

That's because the US' existing overall deficit is not driven solely by trade barriers, but by how the US economy works.

For one, Americans spend and invest more than they earn and that gap means the US buys more from the world than it sells. So as long as that continues, the US may continue to keep running a deficit despite increasing tariffs with it global trading partners.

Some trade deficits can also exist for a number of legitimate reasons - not just down to tariffs. For example, buying food that is easier or cheaper to produce in other countries' climates.

Thomas Sampson of the London School of Economics said: ""The formula is reverse engineered to rationalise charging tariffs on countries with which the US has a trade deficit. There is no economic rationale for doing this and it will cost the global economy dearly.""

Pope Francis greets crowds at St Peter's Square after hospital stay,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg415246d5no,BBC,Mallory Moench,2025-04-06T10:40:25.430Z,"Pope Francis has made asurprise appearance at St Peter's Square in the Vatican following his discharge from hospital after five weeks of treatment.

The Pope briefly appeared on stage in a wheelchair, with an oxygen tube under his nose.

""Hello to everybody,"" he said, waving to cheering crowds. ""Happy Sunday to all of you, thank you very much.""

The Pope, 88, was discharged from hospital in Rome on 23 March and appeared at his window then to offer a blessing.

Doctors said at the time he would need at least two months of rest at his residence. On Friday, the Vatican said his health was improving and he was ""in good spirits"" as he continued his work activities.

The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February for an infection that resulted in double pneumonia. One of his doctors said he had two critical episodes during his treatment where his ""life was in danger"".

As of Friday, the Pope had improved slightly in breathing, movement and speaking, the Vatican said. Recent blood tests also showed a slight improvement in his lung infection.

The Pope is requiring less supplemental oxygen, but continues to receive it during the day. At night, he receives a high-flow of oxygen through his nose as needed.

He has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21, making him more prone to infections.

Flooding sweeps away 9-year-old as storms slam central US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ewg7mmzjjo,BBC,Laura Blasey,2025-04-06T14:11:37.783Z,"A 9-year-old boy in Kentucky was swept away by flood waters on Friday, one of at least 16 people to die in a series of dramatic storms that continue to pummel the US.

High winds and heavy rain continued to batter states including Arkansas, Tennessee and Kentucky on Saturday, delaying recovery efforts.

Forecasters at the National Weather Service said to expect ""potentially historic"" rainfall and wide temperature swings from the central US to the East Coast into Sunday.

The boy was reportedly walking to his school bus stop on Friday morning when he was overtaken by flooding. The Frankfort Police Department, in Frankfort, Kentucky, confirmed it recovered his body about two hours later.

""We are deeply saddened at this horrific tragedy that claimed the life of one of our students,"" Franklin County Schools Superintendent Mark Kopp said at a news conference on Friday.

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear called the boy's death an ""unimaginable loss"". He also confirmed another death - that of an adult - in Kentucky on Saturday.

""We need everyone to understand that all water poses a risk right now. Let's do everything possible to keep our loved ones safe,"" he said in a statement.

National Weather Service forecasters said severe thunderstorms and flash flooding were expected across a wide band of the central US that extended from Arkansas and Louisiana to Western Pennsylvania into Sunday before the system would weaken and move to the East Coast.

As of Saturday afternoon, more than 162,000 people were already without power in Arkansas, Texas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky had already declared states of emergency earlier in the week.

Forecasters said the storms Saturday had ""the makings of a catastrophic, potentially historic heavy rainfall and flash flood event, with some locations potentially seeing rainfall amounts as high as 10-20 (inches) when all is said and done"".

Even when the rain stops, swollen rivers will continue to pose a danger, forecasters said. Changes in pressure and high winds also puts the area from eastern Texas to western Tennessee at enhanced risk for tornados.

It has been apunishing week of weather for the region. Dozens of tornados have been reported and hundreds of counties have spent days under storm warnings since Wednesday.

Tennessee has seen 10 deaths, according to CBS, the BBC's American news partner. Other deaths have included a man and his teenaged daughter in Tennessee and a 68-year-old man in Missouri who reportedly stopped to help a stranded driver.

The same region was hit by tornadoes, wildfires and dust storms that killed 40 andleft ""staggering"" damage in March.

US cancels visas for South Sudanese over deportation dispute,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5x775plnlo,BBC,Max Matza,2025-04-06T00:11:17.556Z,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the US is immediately revoking visas issued to all South Sudanese passport holders due to the African nation refusing to accept its citizens who have been removed from the US.

Rubio, in a statement on Saturday, added that the US will also block any arriving citizens of South Sudan, the world's newest country, at US ports of entry.

He blamed ""the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner"".

A cornerstone of President Donald Trump's immigration policy is removing unlawful migrants from the US, with the promise of ""mass deportations"".

""It is time for the Transitional Government of South Sudan to stop taking advantage of the United States,"" said Rubio.

""Every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the United States, seeks to remove them,"" he added.

It comes as fears grow that South Sudan may again descend into civil war.

On 8 March, the US ordered all its non-emergency staff in South Sudan to leave as regional fighting broke out, threatening a fragile peace deal agreed in 2018.

South Sudanese in the US were previously granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to remain in the US for a set period of time.

TPS for South Sudanese in the US had been due to expire by 3 May.

South Sudan, the world's newest nation, gained independence in 2011 after seceding from Sudan.

But just two years later, following a rift between President Salva Kiir and Vice-President Riek Machar, the tensions erupted into a civil war, in which more than 400,000 people were killed.

A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the two stopped the fighting, but key elements of the deal have not been implemented – including a new constitution, an election and the reunification of armed groups into a single army.

Sporadic violence between ethnic and local groups has continued in parts of the country.

Since returning to office, the Trump administration has clashed with international governments over deportations of their nationals from the US.

In January, Colombian President Gustavo Petro barred two US military flights carrying deported migrants from landing in his South American country.

Petro relented after Trump promised to place crippling tariffs and sanctions on Colombia.

Trump portrait artist says criticism damaging business,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dk54kgnx7o,BBC,Ruth Comerford,2025-04-06T04:20:40.678Z,"An artist whose official portrait of Donald Trump was publicly lambasted by the president said his comments are ""directly and negatively impacting"" her business, threatening its future.

British-born artist Sarah A Boardman painted Trump's official portrait for the Denver State Capitol Gallery of Presidents, where it hung for six years.

In January Trump described Ms Boardman's picture as ""truly the worst"" in a post on Truth Social, adding that it had been distorted and the artist had lost her talent as she aged. It was later removed.

In a statement Ms Boardman said her business was now in ""danger of not recovering"".

""President Trump is entitled to comment freely, as we all are, but the additional allegations that I 'purposefully distorted' the portrait, and that I 'must have lost my talent as I got older' are now directly and negatively impacting my business of over 41 years which now is in danger of not recovering,"" she said.

Ms Boardman was commissioned by the Colorado State Capitol Advisory Committee in Denver.

She said that for the six years the portrait hung in the Colorado State Capitol Building Rotunda, she had received  ""overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback"".

""Since President Trump's comments, that has changed for the worst,"" she added.

""I completed the portrait accurately, without 'purposeful distortion', political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied. I fulfilled the task per my contract.""

The US president has paid close attention to cultivating his image, and made headlines in January by unveiling an official portrait that was variously described by critics as serious or ominous.

Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff confirmed receipt of a new work from Moscow, saying he had been asked to transport it back to Washington. Witkoff described the picture  as a ""beautiful portrait"" by a ""leading Russian artist.""

Southampton relegated in record time with Spurs defeat,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/live/crkxdgxzdvmt,BBC,,,"Southampton have won just 10 points from their 31 games

Southampton suffered the earliest relegation in Premier League history after a Brennan Johnson double inspired Tottenham Hotspur to a comfortable victory in North London.

The Wales forward converted Djed Spence's cut-back in the 13th minute, before he latched on to James Maddison's header over the defence to flick in a second three minutes before half-time.

Mateus Fernandes replied in the 90th minute, but Mathys Tel claimed his first Spurs league goal with a penalty in added time to ensure Saints became the first Premier League side to be relegated with seven games left, beating the previous record of six.

A subdued atmosphere hung over Tottenham Hotspur Stadium following another pre-matchfan protest against chairman Daniel Levyand discontent with manager Ange Postecoglou, following a run of one win in their last 10 home league games that had left them fifth from bottom at the start of the day.

Spurs started brightly though, with Johnson and Lucas Bergvall creating problems and Cristian Romero's thumping header forcing Saints goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale into a smart stop from a corner.

Things could have turned sour for the hosts, though, when Kamaldeen Sulemana drifted in at the far post following a rare foray forward for the visitors, but his shot was deflected on to the post by Pedro Porro.

Spurs responded immediately to claim the opener and ease nerves through Johnson's 10th league goal of the campaign.

Romero was again denied by Ramsdale when another powerful header struck the face of the former Arsenal keeper.

Bergvall thought he had doubled the lead when he bundled home Romero's knock-down from a free-kick, but the Argentine defender was judged to have been offside after a four-minute video assistant referee (VAR) check.

Boss Postecoglou was visibly frustrated on the touchline, but cracked a smile when Johnson caught the Saints defenders on their heels and slotted past Ramsdale.

Southampton improved after the break and dominated possession, with Fernandes chesting down Sulemana's cross and firing through the legs of Vicario in the 90th minute for a late consolation.

Ramsdale made five saves - including fine stops from Spence and Dominic Solanke - to keep the hosts at bay, but Tel's penalty - following a foul by Welington on Johnson - sealed Southampton's fate with an instant return to the Championship.

Rooted to the bottom on 10 points, Saints now need two more points to avoidbeating Derby County'srecord-low tally of 11, achieved in 2007-08.

Spurs' 11th win of the season moved them up to 13th in the table with 37 points.

This experience has to serve for something - JuriÄ

Southampton's return to the Championship has long been on the cards, which perhaps helps explain the freedom with which they played in the second half after going 2-0 down against Spurs.

Ivan Juric's side barely turned up in the first half, but saw more of the ball in the second period and Vicario produced sharp saves to deny Sulemana and substitute Yukinari Sugawara in the final 15 minutes.

The Spurs backline gave Fernandes the freedom of the penalty area to control the ball with his chest and shoot past Vicario for his third of the season, but it was too little, too late to delay the inevitable.

Southampton's failure to create chances is something that has plagued them as the division's lowest scorers, and it's something they will have to address if they want to push for promotion next season.

Before the game Juric said his side's aim was to pass the 11-point mark, set by Derby in 2008. If they can repeat their second-half efforts, they should be able to do that.

Spurs win was important - Postecoglou

With a backdrop of growing tensions between Postecoglou and supporters, and protests against Levy, a second home league win of 2025 was exactly what Tottenham needed.

They should really have gone into half-time with the three points secured.

Saints goalkeeper Ramsdale was engaged in something of a running battle to deny Romero a goal, although it was surprising how quiet Son Heung-min was on his 450th appearance for the club.

The lively Johnson earned a deserved player of the match award, winning the late penalty and allowing loanee Tel to record a confidence-boosting goal.

""He was outstanding and earned the penalty,"" Postecoglou said of Johnson. ""His general play was really good, not just his goals, so really pleased for him.""

Postecoglou was less pleased with the way his side fell away after the break - and unable to keep a first clean sheet since February.

""The first half was really good, really pleased,"" he added. ""We were a bit sloppy with the ball in the second half. [There is] stuff to improve on, but it is a victory with three goals so positive.

""We looked threatening every time we went forward in the first half. We performed well in the first half and we have got to make sure we do that for the full 90.""

Liverpool title push hits a bump - but when can they win it?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp91x70y209o,BBC,,2025-04-06T17:50:19.811Z,"Liverpool's loss at Fulham was their first away league defeat under Arne Slot

Liverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.

Defeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.

But with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title.

""If you look at the goals we conceded, I think all three, we could have prevented them,"" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.

""That is not what we usually see and that is probably why we are where we are, because if you make these mistakes more often in this league, you would not have the amount of points we have.

""The second half is much more like the team we are. Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.""

Despite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?

They could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.

The Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.

Slot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.

""We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,"" he told Sky Sports.

This video can not be played

'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form

We've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?

'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'

Sunday's loss will only add to those shouts. How fair is this, though?

Firstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.

Defending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well.

""The other teams just haven't stepped up this season and Liverpool have been consistent all the way through,"" former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports prior to the Fulham match.

""The rest of them have fallen well below their standards - Arsenal, obviously Manchester City, United, Tottenham.""

It's been a good season for Liverpool to hit full stride then. And Slot's men have certainly done that.

Even if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them.

""I don't even think Liverpool have been outstanding this season, they've been efficient,"" ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports.

""They've been slower in build-up and more ruthless in front of goal.""

Arsenal's much-lauded invincibles finished their title-winning campaign on 90 points back in 2004. Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.

In 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.

Liverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.

Meanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01.

""Liverpool want to reinstate the aura that they've had all season and finish strong,"" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports.

""However they end up winning it is almost up to them. They've been fantastic.""

You can only beat what is front of you and Liverpool have done just that in formidable style - up until Sunday, anyway.

Ovechkin beats legend Gretzky's NHL goal record,https://www.bbc.com/sport/ice-hockey/articles/cjwv02e5j3xo,BBC,,2025-04-06T18:29:12.322Z,"Alex Ovechkin made his NHL debut in 2005

Russia's Alex Ovechkin has become the National Hockey League's highest all-time scorer by hitting his 895th career goal to surpass the legendary Wayne Gretzky's 31-year mark.

Canadian Hall of Famer Gretzky broke the record previously held by his compatriot Gordie Howe in 1994.

Washington Capitals' Ovechkin scored the historic goal against the New York Islanders on Sunday, with Gretzky in attendance.

The game was paused for almost 20 minutes as players and spectators acknowledged the historic moment.

Ovechkin was joined by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and four-time Stanley Cup winner Gretzky, who said: ""I can tell you first hand, I know how hard it is to get 894 - [so] 895 is pretty special.

""They say records are made to be broken but I'm not sure who's gonna get more goals than that.""

Ovechkin celebrated with his team-mates, completed a lap of the arena and then shook hands with his Islanders opponents before being joined by his family.

His feat is all the more remarkable given that his season was interrupted for a few weeks when he broke his leg in November.

Ovechkin tied with Gretzky on Friday, during theCapitals' 4-3 win over the Chicago Black Hawks.

Ovechkin has been a mainstay for Washington Capitals since his NHL debut in October 2005, helping them to their only Stanley Cup victory in 2017-18, and becoming one of the greats.

He has now passed the 40-goal mark in 14 of his 20 NHL seasons, despite missing a month of this campaign with a fractured fibula.

Known for his passionate celebrations and relaxed attitude towards the strict diets expected in the modern game, his face is plastered across the league's marketing material.

But it is the nation's capital where his star truly shines, and with the Capitals having already qualified for the post-season play-offs, he may soon be writing his name in the city's history books once again.

Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe are the two previous holders of the NHL goals record

Ovechkin is passing an all-time great - indeed, Gretzky was given the rather straightforward nickname of 'The Great One' during his career.

The Canadian played 21 seasons in the NHL between 1979 and 1999 predominantly for the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings.

Gretzky has held the NHL goals record since he scored his 802nd on 23 March 1994, passing the total of post-war icon Howe, his compatriot and hero.

While he may have lost that record, Gretzky still holds the league record for the most overall points and assists.

Ovechkin may have edged closer, but 'The Great One' remains out on his own.

1 - Alex Ovechkin (Rus, 2005-) - 895

2 - Wayne Gretzky (Can, 1979-99) - 894

3 - Gordie Howe (Can, 1946-80) - 801

4 - Jaromir Jagr (Cze, 1990-2018) - 766

5 - Brett Hull (US, 1986-2006) - 741

'We must avoid that record' - what went wrong for relegated Saints?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg5qy16e18po,BBC,,2025-04-06T17:24:17.969Z,"Southampton have been relegated with seven games remaining, a Premier League record

The inevitable has been confirmed.

Southampton's3-1 defeatat Tottenham guaranteed what everyone had known for a long time now - they will be playing Championship football next season.

Ivan Juric's men have become the first Premier League team to be relegated with as many as seven matches still to play.

And they still need two more points to avoid taking the tag of being theworst Premier League team in historyfrom Derby County's class of 2007/08.

With fourth-bottom Wolves 12 points clear, Saints are almost certain to be joined in the second tier by Leicester and Ipswich, with the trio needing another 19 points to avoid becoming the worst bottom three ever in the Premier League.

Nothing else is certain, not least the future of manager Juric whose 18-month contract is believed tocontain a break clause.

""No, now we will see everything,"" said the 49-year-old Croatian when asked if talks had taken place regarding his future.

""We are thinking just about the games now. We will see now what everyone thinks, what I think. The fans deserve much more and we have to understand all of the mistakes we have made and then create something really strong.

""It's a difficult day, a tough day but I see the fans, how they love their players and their team - it's something incredible. This experience has to serve to create something stronger than this.""

Southampton's season has been troubled from the start.

They lost eight of their opening nine games this term, and after 23 games had just one victory to their name.

After replacing Russell Martin in December, Juric oversaw six straight defeats and has just one win in his 14 league games at the helm.

Saints were nine points adrift of safety when he came in, but 22 points now separate them from Wolves, who won 2-1 at third-bottom Ipswich on Saturday.

They had five points from Martin's top-flight spell this season, one under interim boss Simon Rusk and four so far during Juric's tenure.

Southampton are only the third team to lose as many as 25 of their first 31 games of a top-flight campaign, after Sunderland in 2005-06 and Sheffield United in 2020-21 (both also 25).

They have conceded the most goals in the league (74) by far, and are the lowest scorers in the top four divisions of English football (23 goals in 31 games).

No team has ever had fewer points in the Premier League after 31 games (10), although Sunderland in 2005-06 & Derby in 2007-08 had the same tally too.

Saints have the same amount of points after 31 games (10) as Derby County did in 2007-08, with Rams going on to achieve 11. Derby's campaign remains the worst in Premier League history, although it's a record Southampton could still beat.

""We have to avoid that record, do our best. It cannot happen,"" added Juric.

Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale echoed those thoughts as he said: ""We want to get as many points as we can until the end of the season. No-one wants that record and we will do what we can - but we will do what we can to get more points on the board.""

This is the third relegation Ramsdale has suffered during his career, having gone down with Bournemouth in 2019-20 and Sheffield United in 2020-21.

""Some [players] are experiencing relegation for the first time, so there will be a lot of emotions from them over the next few days,"" he added.

""The lads who have been here before, we have to try to pick the young boys up. This group did incredible things last season. Nobody will want to jump ship with seven games to go. We are tight and we have just got to pull each other through now.""

Saints captain Jan Bednarek was also honest about his team's situation.

""We can't change the past, the only thing we can do in the last seven games is to enjoy being in the Premier League,"" he said.

""We have to improve as players and as a club. Hopefully we are going to build something great. The best thing is that we can learn, we can work hard and we can improve.""

This experience has to serve for something - JuriÄ

The die was cast in the summer. Many around St Mary's felt they were going into the season with a weaker squad than the one which took them up from the Championship following a play-off final win over Leeds.

There was frustration with the ownership as chief executive Phil Parsons - who joined from Dyson in July 2023 - had limited experience in the game and the club struggled to move quickly enough to get deals done.

Returning to the Premier League without an experienced sporting director was viewed as a massive error by the ownership, especially following technical director Jason Wilcox's departure to Manchester United. It left a huge question mark over their structure, the ownership's direction and left a hole in the support network for the head coach.

Interest was reignited in Fabio Carvalho, having lost out to Hull to take him on loan from Liverpool last season, before he went to Brentford for Â£27.5m.

A fee of Â£15m plus Â£5m in add-ons was agreed with Manchester City for striker Liam Delap, only for Ipswich to offer better wages. Winger Jack Clarke also went to the Tractor Boys from Sunderland, while midfielder Flynn Downes' Â£15m move from West Ham was also almost hijacked by Ipswich too.

Three bids for Matt O'Riley, the final worth around Â£20m, were not enough to tempt Celtic to sell and the Denmark midfielder joined Brighton for Â£25m, while an offer for Bournemouth full-back Max Aarons was also rejected.

In came Ben Brereton-Diaz, Ronnie Edwards, Nathan Wood, Charlie Taylor, Cameron Archer and Ryan Fraser, yet the club circulated several names including Brereton-Diaz, Edwards and Taylor to Championship sides ahead of January in the hope of loaning them out.

Edwards and Brereton-Diaz joined QPR and Sheffield United respectively, while left-back Taylor, a free transfer from Burnley, has played just 56 minutes since October.

Winger Maxwel Cornet signed on loan from West Ham but managed just 71 minutes in the league, before returning to the London Stadium in January.

Centre-back Taylor Harwood-Bellis' Â£20m move from Manchester City, having joined initially on loan in 2023, was triggered after promotion, but the one-cap England international is expected to leave in the summer.

The fall-out to the summer has also continued with head of recruitment Darren Mowbray leaving St Mary's in April, although sources told BBC Sport there was no issue with the players he was recommending.

How Verstappen stole Suzuka with McLaren stuck in 'rabbit hole',https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c4g479ewwx2o,BBC,,2025-04-06T11:19:02.121Z,"Max Verstappen has won the past four Japanese Grands Prix from pole position

Max Verstappen stole the Japanese Grand Prix from McLaren with a weekend of the sort of rare perfection that comes only from drivers of the very highest quality.

Verstappen's Red Bull was not the fastest car around Suzuka, but the four-time champion converted his stunning pole position on Saturday into his fourth consecutive win at the track.

His drive on Sunday - under pressure from the McLarens all race, albeit knowing that overtaking was next to impossible in cars with relatively closely matched performance - was flawless.

But his weekend was made with a qualifying lap that drew superlatives from all over the F1 paddock.

Verstappen's engineer Gianpiero Lambiase described it as ""insane"". Aston Martin driver Fernando Alonso, a friend and fan of Verstappen, said it was ""magical"" and that ""only he can do that"".Verstappen himself called it ""very rare"".

It gave Verstappen pole from McLaren's Lando Norris by just 0.012 seconds. Knowing that if he retained the lead at the start, the race was a long way to being won, Verstappen did exactly that.

With overtaking so difficult, McLaren's one chance to beat him was by stopping Norris for fresh tyres before Verstappen.

But they did not take that opportunity, and once Verstappen won the race out of the pits after he and Norris stopped on the same lap, all he had to do was keep it clean and mistake-free. The McLarens were always there, right behind, ready to pounce on any error. But Verstappen being Verstappen, none came.

Verstappen fends off Norris to win in Japan

How to follow Bahrain Grand Prix on the BBC

Verstappen's qualifying lap ""came out of nowhere"", Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko told BBC Sport.

""First corner - unbelievable the speed he was going in,"" Marko said. ""It's like his body doesn't feel G-forces. When the car is to his liking, he can drive 110%. Every corner absolutely on the limit and, like in races, he doesn't make mistakes.""

Overlaying their laps, Norris and Verstappen were neck and neck until the final chicane. Verstappen nailed it, Norris lost some time, and pole was decided.

Norris' team-mate Oscar Piastri, on provisional pole after the first runs in final qualifying, made a mistake early in his last effort, and slipped back to third.

McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said: ""I'm sure our two drivers will have commented themselves that their qualifying laps were not the best laps in qualifying in their careers.

""Clearly, when Max elevates the game so much, you need to nail laps in qualifying and you need to bring home any possible millisecond.

""Yesterday it was indeed a matter of milliseconds, with 43-45 milliseconds between P3 and P1. Ultimately, I think the qualifying laps in Q3 were even more of a determining factor than anything that happened today in the race.""

Max Verstappen and Lando Norris came close to contact on the pit-lane exit

McLaren's one chink of light in the race was the pit stops. Norris was about 1.5 seconds behind Verstappen as they neared, just about within theoretical range of the 'undercut', where a driver gains a position by stopping first and using the time gained on fresh tyres to be ahead by the time his rival exits the pits.

But McLaren were undone by an unfortunate set of circumstances.

They 'dummied' a stop with Norris on lap 18, with a fake radio message telling him to pit. Red Bull ignored them.

Then Mercedes stopped George Russell on lap 19. His pace on new tyres threatened to undercut him ahead of Piastri. And that meant McLaren had to pit Piastri on lap 20 to be sure of retaining his position. Although the McLaren was faster than the Mercedes, the difficulty of overtaking meant they did not believe Piastri would have been able to pass Russell on track.

That gave the game away to Red Bull, who realised Norris would come in next time around. So they stopped Verstappen. Keeping Norris out would not have worked - he'd have lost more time on his old tyres. So he had to pit, too.

Even then, McLaren fashioned a sliver of a chance. Norris' stop was a full second faster than Verstappen's and the Briton was halfway alongside the Red Bull when they exited the pits. But Verstappen was entitled to keep his line, and he did.

The narrowing track meant Norris' trajectory took him on to the grass. He had to back off, and the lead stayed with Verstappen.

""Maybe we could have tried more with strategy,"" Norris said. ""We'll discuss that.

""Could we have gone earlier? Yes. But then you're at risk of safety cars. If you box three laps earlier and the safety car comes out, you look stupid.""

Stella said it was ""unclear"" whether the undercut would have worked. He said they would ""review"" the data. But on Sunday evening he was not prepared to say that this was a race that got away, as McLaren subsequently said about their strategy choices at Canada and Silverstone last year.

Although the McLaren was the fastest car, other circumstances of Suzuka played against them once Verstappen was on pole.

Their car has a tyre-wear advantage and that is traditionally high at Suzuka. Last year, that might have meant their pace advantage would have grown through the stints, creating an overtaking possibility.

But the first sector of the lap had been resurfaced and that led to degradation being low, so they had lost one of their theoretical advantages over their rivals.

""So, once, for instance, you nail the qualifying laps like Max did yesterday,"" Stella said, ""then it gets a little bit difficult to get out of the rabbit hole.""

Japanese Grand Prix Review

Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions

Verstappen's performance underlined just how significant a threat he remains to the title hopes of McLaren, Norris and Piastri despite Red Bull's somewhat difficult start to the season. Not least because, in what seems to be in ultimate terms the third fastest car in F1, he is now only one point behind Norris in the championship.

""I know how good he is,"" Norris said. ""I know what he's capable of doing. So I would say nothing is a surprise any more. But yeah, I still believe that we're going to have some good races and we can go toe-to-toe and that some days he'll come out on top and others I will.""

As for Verstappen, he said his performance over the Japan weekend felt as special to him as it did to those looking in from the outside.

But he added: ""It also means I really care even though it has not been the easiest start to the year for us. We are not where we want to be in terms of performance.

""This weekend has been just really, really nice. Sometimes you have those kind of moments when you get some really great laps out of it.""

But if the weekend was a reminder to McLaren what they are up against in the shape of Verstappen - and Stella insisted, too, that they still felt a threat from Mercedes and Ferrari, that the season was still in a ""transient phase"" where relative performance was dictated by circuit variability - so also were there warning signs for Red Bull.

Alonso says that Verstappen's performance at the weekend reminded him of his 2012 season, when he fought valiantly but ultimately unsuccessfully for the title with Ferrari against a much faster Red Bull in the hands of Sebastian Vettel, in what he regards as his finest season.

""I have been fighting for world championships with the third, fourth fastest car,"" the Spaniard said. ""So at the end it is difficult, as it was difficult for me to beat Vettel. I hope for him he can fight until the end but they need to improve a little bit the car.

""He won four, so he can fight with a little bit less competitive car. It is hard and I think people don't realise how difficult it is, and how you need to make perfect every weekend. And he's doing that so far.""

There is a degree of irony in the fact that Alonso's race engineer at Ferrari at the time was Stella.

""Max at the moment is somehow making the difference himself,"" the Italian said, ""but it's very difficult to keep up for 24 events in a season if you don't have the best car.""

McLaren are leading the constructors' championship by 36 points from Mercedes with Red Bull in third, 50 points behind

Liverpool title push hits a bump - but when can they win it?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cp91x70y209o,BBC,,2025-04-06T17:50:19.811Z,"Liverpool's loss at Fulham was their first away league defeat under Arne Slot

Liverpool's unbeaten run has come to an end but - barring a remarkable collapse - they will end the season as Premier League champions.

Defeat at Fulham was the Reds' first in 26 league games and just their second of the campaign.

But with seven games remaining, Arne Slot's side require a maximum of 11 points more to secure the title.

""If you look at the goals we conceded, I think all three, we could have prevented them,"" Slot told BBC Match of the Day.

""That is not what we usually see and that is probably why we are where we are, because if you make these mistakes more often in this league, you would not have the amount of points we have.

""The second half is much more like the team we are. Conceding three goals in the manner we did is not of the standards of Liverpool. That's clear.""

Despite the setback at Craven Cottage,  a record-equalling 20th top-flight crown is surely a formality now?

They could even win the title as early as 20 April - if results elsewhere go their way - with no team in Premier League history throwing away a lead of this size at this stage of the season.

The Reds' dominance has been clear for all to see this campaign, and they lead second-placed Arsenal by 11 points.

Slot is certainly expecting his side to bounce back and get the job done.

""We played a good game on Wednesday [against Everton] and we will show up against West Ham [on Sunday] as well,"" he told Sky Sports.

'Mo will show up' - Slot not worried by Salah's form

We've all heard the accusations and whispers this season from rival fans, haven't we?

'This Liverpool team isn't actually that great.' 'The Premier League is a poor league this season.' 'Liverpool's class of 2024-25 wouldn't have won the title in another season.'

Sunday's loss will only add to those shouts. How fair is this, though?

Firstly, it has to be said Liverpool's usual rivals are not having their best seasons.

Defending champions Manchester City are on track for their worst campaign under Pep Guardiola, Manchester United are set for their worst season in Premier League history, Arsenal are nine points adrift of their points tally at this stage of last season, while Tottenham and Chelsea have suffered their own struggles as well.

""The other teams just haven't stepped up this season and Liverpool have been consistent all the way through,"" former Manchester United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports prior to the Fulham match.

""The rest of them have fallen well below their standards - Arsenal, obviously Manchester City, United, Tottenham.""

It's been a good season for Liverpool to hit full stride then. And Slot's men have certainly done that.

Even if Arsenal were on the 71 points they had reached at this stage last season, when they were top of the table, Liverpool would still be two points ahead of them.

""I don't even think Liverpool have been outstanding this season, they've been efficient,"" ex-Manchester City defender Micah Richards told Sky Sports.

""They've been slower in build-up and more ruthless in front of goal.""

Arsenal's much-lauded invincibles finished their title-winning campaign on 90 points back in 2004. Slot's men need 18 points from seven games to beat that.

In 32 Premier League seasons, only 14 sides have reached that mark and one of them - Manchester United in 1993-94 - did so in a 42-game season.

Liverpool are also the only side to get 90-plus points and not win the title - doing so twice under Jurgen Klopp - meaning only 12 of the previous 31 league-winning sides posted in 90 points or more.

Meanwhile, the average number of points for the team in second after their 31st game of a season is 65.4 - slightly higher than Arsenal's current 62 points - but there have been second-placed teams on much lower tallies at this stage, including Arsenal's 57 points in 2000-01.

""Liverpool want to reinstate the aura that they've had all season and finish strong,"" former Manchester City midfielder Izzy Christiansen told Sky Sports.

""However they end up winning it is almost up to them. They've been fantastic.""

You can only beat what is front of you and Liverpool have done just that in formidable style - up until Sunday, anyway.

'The plan nearly worked' - will Maresca regret selection gamble?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cj3xev2ree2o,BBC,,2025-04-06T18:07:37.887Z,"Cole Palmer was left on the bench for the first time since December 2023 in the Premier League

When Enzo Maresca's starting line-up was announced before Chelsea's trip to Brentford on Sunday, there was a sense of surprise among many Blues fans across social media.

And, after a drab goalless draw at Brentford stretched their winless away run to eight matches to leave their Champions League hopes in the balance, the questions about his team selection grew even louder.

Maresca rested Nicolas Jackson, Cole Palmer, Marc Cucurella and an in-form Pedro Neto against their west London rivals. In came Malo Gusto, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Christopher Nkunku and Noni Madueke, who all struggled to make an impact.

All four of Chelsea's rested stars came on in the second half and the Blues went from having just six shots and one on target before the interval to 17 shots and four on target.

The Chelsea boss also faced criticism from sections of the away end, who have shown increasing frustration at his style of play, amid chants of ""attack, attack, attack"" and ""we've had a shot"" during a poor first half.

The bigger concern is, although Chelsea remain fourth, the fight for the Champions League places is looking increasingly competitive, with Manchester City, Aston Villa and Newcastle all within three points of the Blues.

With a Conference League quarter-final against Legia Warsaw to come on Thursday,  and the likes of Palmer and Jackson just returning from injuries, Maresca was quick to defend his squad rotation.

The Italian also blamed the quick turnaround for his selection gamble, claiming it was unfair the Blues had 24 hours less than Brentford to prepare for the match, having played Tottenham at home on Thursday.

""Not all of them were 100%,"" he said. ""The idea was to start one way and finish another way. The plan nearly worked because we created more in the second half but the volume probably wasn't enough to win the game.""

When pressed by BBC Sport on whether he could have rotated in other games, he added: ""This is a different opinion. I am here to try to do the best for the club and players.

""I work every day with the players so I can see how they are. I am not sure if Spurs at home is harder than Brentford away. For me, they are all complicated.""

Chelsea are winless in eight away matches, avoiding defeat away from Stamford Bridge for the first time in five matches on Sunday but having last tasted victory on their travels in early December at Tottenham.

They have been better at home and won five in a row.

The away form will be a concern though, with difficult trips away at Fulham, Newcastle and Nottingham Forest to come before the end of the season.

It feels an age away now when Chelsea were being talked about as being Liverpool's mostrealistic title challengers- a 2-1 win at home to Brentford securing a seventh straight win in December.

There are also concerns about misfiring forwards with Palmer on a long goal drought, Jackson 10 games without a goal while Sancho has not scored in 20 matches in all competitions.

Maresca is facing increasing criticism about Chelsea's conservative style of play and failure to qualify for the Champions League - with a top-five finish likely to be enough to seal a place - would only amplify this.

Chelsea's accounts highlight how important the lucrative Champions League is to the club.

Earlier this week they announceda Â£128m profit,which included income from selling their women's team to parent company BlueCo for Â£200m.

After several transfer windows of lavish spending the club would have lost more than Â£70m without this repositioning, and thus fallen foul of the Premier League's profit and sustainability regulations.

Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghbali's BlueCo also announced a heavy loss of Â£400m, and there was increased borrowing with interest payments due.

The substantial revenues involved in playing in the Champions League are crucial to help deliver a return on investment and in a season without a front-of-shirt sponsor, competing in Europe's elite competition would attract the kind of Â£70m-a-year sponsor the club is looking for.

That's not to mention the importance of qualifying for the competition to star players like Palmer, Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez.

""For sure, it will be very important. I said since day one that our target is to bring this club back to where it should be, which is Champions League,"" Maresca, 45, added.

""Since day one we have been in the top four or five so we hope to finish there.""

Valky:The mood among the fellow Chelsea fans attending the Brentford match having seen the starting line-up is one of incredulity. Legia Warsaw is the match where you rest key players. What a comedown after the excellent and exciting Spurs performance.

Nana:Really hope Maresca knows what he's doing because that's got to be one of the most toothless attacks I've seen for a while, even if you have to rest some players.

Martinez, Rwanda:Enzo Maresca really left out Cole Palmer and Nicolas Jackson versus Brentfordâ¦ and we're meant to be pushing for top four? Conference League QF is on Thursday - plenty of time to recover. No need to panic rotate now. When will he learn?

Pogacar & record-breaking Kopecky   claim Tour of Flanders wins,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cycling/articles/creq82ezprgo,BBC,,2025-04-06T16:09:25.111Z,"Tadej Pogacar previously won the Tour of Flanders in 2023

Tadej Pogacar held off defending champion Mathieu van der Poel to claim his second Tour of Flanders title.

The three-time Tour de France champion, racing for UAE Team Emirates-XRG, completed the 270km course in Belgium in five hours, 58 minutes and 41 seconds.

Pogacar finished just over a minute clear of Denmark's Mads Pedersen in second, while Dutchman Van der Poel came third, having recovered from a crash with 127km to go.

The Tour of Flanders, which began in 1919 and known as De Ronde, is a historic one-day road race held in Belgium every spring and highlighted by climbs and cobbled sectors.

""The goal was to win, but at the end it's hard to realise. I cannot be more proud of the team,"" said 26-year-old Pogacar.

Van der Poel re-joined the peloton within just 10km of his crash and tussled with Pogacar through the hills.

Lotte Kopecky became the first woman to win three Tour of Flanders titles

But the Slovenian pulled away with a race-winning attack on the final ascent of the Oude Kwaremont with around 15km to go and cruised along the flat roads to a solo victory.

The chasing pack sprinted for the remaining medal positions with Belgian Wout van Aert missing out on a podium finish.

In the women's race, Belgian Lotte Kopecky made history as the first cyclist to win three editions of the event.

Riding for Team SD Worx, the 29-year-old claimed victory in thrilling style by winning a four-way sprint finish ahead of France's Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, Liane Lippert of Germany and Poland's Katarzyna Niewiadoma-Phinney.

""It was a crazy race with a lot of crashes in the beginning,"" said Kopecky. ""When it went with the four of us I was pretty confident.""

Italian rider Elisa Longo Borghini was among the favourites with Kopecky and also chasing a third Tour of Flanders title, but had to withdraw after crashing around 95km from the finish.

Around 750,000 spectators gathered on the streets from Bruges to Oudenaarde for the event, which is one of five one-day races in the cycling calendar known as the Monuments.

The others are Milan-San Remo, Paris-Roubaix, the Liege-Bastogne-Liege and Tour of Lombardy.

On 13 April, Pogacar will be taking part on more cobbled tracks for the Paris-Roubaix race - known as 'hell of the north' - for the first time, where Van der Poel is again the defending champion.

""Roubaix is a completely different race, but I will accept the challenge and try to do my best,"" added Pogacar.

Ovechkin beats legend Gretzky's NHL goal record,https://www.bbc.com/sport/ice-hockey/articles/cjwv02e5j3xo,BBC,,2025-04-06T18:29:12.322Z,"Alex Ovechkin made his NHL debut in 2005

Russia's Alex Ovechkin has become the National Hockey League's highest all-time scorer by hitting his 895th career goal to surpass the legendary Wayne Gretzky's 31-year mark.

Canadian Hall of Famer Gretzky broke the record previously held by his compatriot Gordie Howe in 1994.

Washington Capitals' Ovechkin scored the historic goal against the New York Islanders on Sunday, with Gretzky in attendance.

The game was paused for almost 20 minutes as players and spectators acknowledged the historic moment.

Ovechkin was joined by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and four-time Stanley Cup winner Gretzky, who said: ""I can tell you first hand, I know how hard it is to get 894 - [so] 895 is pretty special.

""They say records are made to be broken but I'm not sure who's gonna get more goals than that.""

Ovechkin celebrated with his team-mates, completed a lap of the arena and then shook hands with his Islanders opponents before being joined by his family.

His feat is all the more remarkable given that his season was interrupted for a few weeks when he broke his leg in November.

Ovechkin tied with Gretzky on Friday, during theCapitals' 4-3 win over the Chicago Black Hawks.

Ovechkin has been a mainstay for Washington Capitals since his NHL debut in October 2005, helping them to their only Stanley Cup victory in 2017-18, and becoming one of the greats.

He has now passed the 40-goal mark in 14 of his 20 NHL seasons, despite missing a month of this campaign with a fractured fibula.

Known for his passionate celebrations and relaxed attitude towards the strict diets expected in the modern game, his face is plastered across the league's marketing material.

But it is the nation's capital where his star truly shines, and with the Capitals having already qualified for the post-season play-offs, he may soon be writing his name in the city's history books once again.

Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe are the two previous holders of the NHL goals record

Ovechkin is passing an all-time great - indeed, Gretzky was given the rather straightforward nickname of 'The Great One' during his career.

The Canadian played 21 seasons in the NHL between 1979 and 1999 predominantly for the Edmonton Oilers and Los Angeles Kings.

Gretzky has held the NHL goals record since he scored his 802nd on 23 March 1994, passing the total of post-war icon Howe, his compatriot and hero.

While he may have lost that record, Gretzky still holds the league record for the most overall points and assists.

Ovechkin may have edged closer, but 'The Great One' remains out on his own.

1 - Alex Ovechkin (Rus, 2005-) - 895

2 - Wayne Gretzky (Can, 1979-99) - 894

3 - Gordie Howe (Can, 1946-80) - 801

4 - Jaromir Jagr (Cze, 1990-2018) - 766

5 - Brett Hull (US, 1986-2006) - 741
