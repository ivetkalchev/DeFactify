Every meal. Don’t even think about trying to gussy them up with pickle relish. The only way you make it through these next few years is filling every shelf in your pantry with little canned wieners and knocking back the leftover hot dog water with a smile on your face. Buckle up, America. You live in ‘the wiener times’ now.” At press time, millions of Americans reportedly realized they could no longer afford the canned wieners.

How else were we to know they weren’t subhuman scum that needed to be wiped off the face of the earth?” Israeli officials went on to clarify that when it came to Palestinians identifying themselves as conscious beings deserving of respect, crying and begging for one’s life did not count as sufficient verification.

It’s clear that adults who were formula-fed as infants face significant disadvantages when it comes to suckling later in life, and this can only be remedied by years of occupational suckling therapy.” Kline concluded by cautioning that despite the encouraging results, those who suckle excessively as infants may develop suckling strength so intense that in adulthood they slurp a nipple clear off the body.

If you hand them a shell to examine, they’ll accuse of having removed the claw-foot bathtub where the turtle takes a sudsy bubble bath and say you are trying to trick them. Across the political spectrum, many people harbor the belief that when a turtle goes to sleep, he puts on a nightcap and pulls a patchwork quilt over him in a canopy bed before blowing out a stub of candle.” At press time, several states had introduced legislation that would require the turtle-apartment theory to be included in high school biology textbooks.

The stage curtains reportedly rose to reveal the vice president, an amateur horn player, standing by himself behind a music stand, a sight that elicited gasps and murmurs from those in attendance. According to sources, the crowd began booing and jeering Vance within the first 15 seconds of his performance of Franz Strauss’s Horn Concerto, Op. 8, causing the vice president to quickly lose his confidence and begin playing cracked and flat notes. Several reports indicated that the vice president attempted to make eye contact with his wife, second lady Usha Vance, who sat in the box tier, but she only looked away and stared down at her hands. At press time, Vance was said to have dropped his French horn to the floor and run off the stage in tears, knocking over the music stand in the process.

Kennedy Jr. claimed Friday that measles could be cured with a good concealer. “If you contract measles or suspect you have contracted measles, I recommend immediately applying a high-quality, full-coverage liquid or cream color corrector to affected areas,” said Kennedy, who added that HHS was rushing to distribute facial cleanser, foundation, and 10-ounce tubes of L’Oréal Infallible to pharmacies in the region. “Our nation’s top infectious disease doctors recommend anyone who has been exposed to measles immediately use a ring light to assess their skin, apply a dab of 24-hour concealer, and then smooth with a brush or Beautyblender makeup sponge. The truth is, if Americans just had proper access to lightweight cosmetic products capable of hiding blemishes, eliminating uneven skin tone, and highlighting natural complexion, measles could be eradicated.” At press time, Kennedy had released a makeup tutorial where he demonstrated how to apply concealer manufactured by his wife Cheryl Hines’ makeup company for extra measles protection.

Report: More Americans Moving Away From Urban Areas For Rural Life Where They Have Escalating Feud With Beaver,https://theonion.com/report-more-americans-moving-away-from-urban-areas-for-rural-life-where-they-have-escalating-feud-with-beaver/,The Onion,,2025-03-14T08:00:00-05:00,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Suggesting the reversal of a longstanding historical trend towards urbanization, a report published Tuesday by researchers at Harvard University revealed that more Americans were moving away from cities to pursue a rural life where they have an escalating feud with a beaver. “Our findings indicate there has been a 15% increase in Americans who trade the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life for an agrestic existence in which they dismantle a small beaver dam on their property, leading the determined rodent to seek retribution,” said the report’s lead author, Keith Rawlings, noting that rising rents and concerns about crime had driven even long-term city dwellers to purchase a secluded woodland home whose walls, cabinets, and tables would ultimately be gnawed into a series of elaborate booby traps by the vengeful beaver and his family. “More U.S. citizens are leaving behind the nightlife and cultural events of large urban centers, preferring to spend their disposable income on a faulty beaver-trapping kit, an eccentric exterminator who will end up poisoning himself, and a two-barrel shotgun they will use to destroy their remaining possessions in a desperate pursuit of the elusive semiaquatic mammal. While many say they miss the convenience and variety of cities, they nonetheless prefer a country life in which they realize the beaver would make the perfect mascot for the big ad campaign they’ve been working on and ultimately learn to live in peace with the creature.” Rawlings added that, by contrast, a relatively negligible number of Americans were choosing to leave rural areas in pursuit of an urban life in which they befriend a wise-cracking pigeon.

Cackling Hims CEO Threatens To Pull Switch Activating All World’s Erections At Once,https://theonion.com/cackling-hims-ceo-threatens-to-pull-switch-activating-all-worlds-erections-at-once/,The Onion,,2025-03-07T08:00:00-06:00,"SAN FRANCISCO—Warning that every flaccid member across the globe now represented a ticking time bomb in his hands, cackling Hims CEO Joseph Ludlum released a statement Friday in which he threatened to pull a switch that would activate all the world’s erections at once.

In the three-minute video address, which was broadcast suddenly to millions of screens across the planet, Ludlum dared world leaders to question his resolve and stood before a massive electrically charged array that he referred to as the Universal Engorgement Generator. Sources confirmed that as energy crackled through the minimalist, pastel-colored laboratory in the recording, Ludlum insisted that only if his demands were met could the planet avoid the mass chaos that would ensue if the genitals of countless men were to grow harder than anyone could ever imagine.

“Citizens of Earth, we at Hims have long served as overseers of your sexual health, and today we come with a simple request: $10 trillion by midnight, or we will trigger every last one of your erections,” Joseph Ludlum said in the video, letting out a high-pitched laugh as he marveled at how easy wresting control of the world’s phalluses had been. “For years, you fools have sat idly by, enjoying discreet shipping to your door and chomping down on our Hard Mints like so much candy. Did you ever think to question what all the low prices were for? Did you not realize your lifeless members were slowly becoming marionettes in thrall to my every order?”

“Picture it, if you will: millions and millions of once-limp penises, all growing stiff in an instant with the same active ingredients used in Cialis and Viagra,” Ludlum continued.

Authorities have treated as credible claims that the extensive Hims telehealth network—which gives the company access to billions of erections—could be utilized to create widespread havoc through sudden engorgement, blue balls, and even premature ejaculations. However, officials urged citizens to stay calm and refrain from tampering with their genitalia, stressing that any misstep on their part could immediately set off every erection in a 10-mile radius.

Even as all 193 U.N. member states refused to capitulate to what they called the “ravings of a madman,” the Hims website reportedly updated with a countdown clock and a new “Frequently Asked Questions For Hapless Nitwits” section, which included such entries as “Myths of ED: If you cross the Hims corporation, will your penis inflate so much that it blows up?” “What happens if I already have an erection when the engorgement beam strikes me?” and “If Hims can make me hard whenever they want, can they also make me soft again, and then hard and then soft, so that my member is forever prancing to their mad tune like a dancer to a piper’s song?”

Reports confirmed that each passing minute since the broadcast has brought mounting terror among untold numbers of men who have grown paralyzed with fear at the prospect of losing control of their own genitals, which could become distended with blood and potentially never go flaccid again—a scenario that the Hims executive described in a taunting follow-up warning.

“Can your puny governments not comprehend the consequences of such mass penis-hardening?” Ludlum said in a second video. “Mayhem in the street. Cars driving off roads. Entire city blocks left in ruin. Do you fools dare defy our warnings? Well, then, perhaps a little taste of our stiffening power will show you how serious we truly are.”

“Now, come, my soft little pretties, and rise up for your master’s commands!” he added, throwing a switch that began crackling with electricity as it sent a wave of engorgement through the atmosphere of the Northeastern United States.

With widespread disorder spreading across the region, officials in New York and Boston confirmed boardrooms descended into panicked chaos, planes stalled on runways, and men stared at their penises while screaming in response to the sudden unimaginable rigidity entering their loins. The Centers for Disease Control confirmed that over 12,000 residents were hospitalized with erections that lasted longer than four hours.

The Hims CEO later issued a press release that simply read, “Tick-tock, tick-tock, dear friends,” before signing off as “the Puppetmaster of Phalluses.”

“Now, you fools, midnight fast approaches, and I will turn my device to full blast, demonstrating the true power of my—of my—oh no, I’m…I’m…gahh!” an out-of-breath Ludlum said in his final dispatch, moments after the machine misfired and blasted him with its engorgement beam, causing the CEO to fall to his knees in a gasp of defeat. “Curses! Someone must have meddled with the Premature Ejacu-Ray setting. Hold on. No, it’s fine. Just leave me alone. It’s just… I said it’s fine! Don’t touch me. I just don’t like to be touched afterwards.”

“You haven’t seen the last of me!” he added. “But for now I must go rest and regain my strength.”

Study Finds Revving Corvette Outside Her Office Best Way To Show Ex What She’s Missing,https://theonion.com/study-finds-revving-corvette-outside-her-office-best-way-to-show-ex-what-shes-missing/,The Onion,,2025-02-27T10:21:04-06:00,"BOSTON—In a new study conducted to examine the effects of high-octane vehicles on getting her back once and for all, researchers have concluded that revving the engine of a Corvette convertible outside your ex-girlfriend’s office is the best way to show her what she’s missing. “According to our data, the efficacy of pulling up to the parking lot of her office plaza in your sweet-ass ride is nearly unmatched in terms of convincing her to get back together, and when you incorporate the act of gunning the engine until a huge cloud of exhaust pours out of the tailpipe, those results nearly triple,” lead researcher Tanya Kramer told reporters Thursday, explaining that the study also found a strong correlation between blasting AC/DC’s “T.N.T.” from the car’s killer speakers and your ex-girlfriend finally seeing the error of her ways. “When presented with the sight of a misunderstood bad boy doing donuts in the parking lot right outside their workplace, nine out of 10 of participants reacted with total awe and intense sexual arousal that left them pining after the relationship they once had.” Researchers added that these results were only obtained in cases where drivers left their tinted windows rolled up to conceal their tears.
