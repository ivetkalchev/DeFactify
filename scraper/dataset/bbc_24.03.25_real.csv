Ukraine upbeat and Russia in no rush at truce talks in Saudi Arabia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly65gm5jp9o,BBC,Frank Gardner,23-03-25,"US negotiators have held talks in the Saudi capital Riyadh with their Ukrainian counterparts and are separately meeting the Russians.

Washington's aim is to bring about an immediate partial ceasefire to the war in Ukraine, followed by a comprehensive peace deal.

So could these Riyadh talks produce the breakthrough so many are hoping for?

It depends who you listen to.

""I feel that he (Putin) wants peace,"" said President Trump's personal envoy Steve Witkoff, adding: ""I think that you're going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress.""

Yet Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman has dampened expectations. ""We are only at the beginning of this path,"" he told Russian state TV.

Kyiv suffered one of its heaviest attacks from Russian drones on Saturday night, with three people killed, including a five-year-old girl.

""We need to push Putin to give a real order to stop the strikes,"" said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in his evening address on Sunday. ""The one who brought this war must take it away.""

The Kremlin, meanwhile, seems to be in no rush to sign up to a ceasefire, with Vladimir Putin adding on numerous ""nuances"", or preconditions,  before agreeing to the 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington and agreed to by Kyiv.

In Riyadh the US-Ukraine talks began soon after nightfall on Sunday, behind closed doors in one of Saudi Arabia's many luxury establishments, with the Ukrainian delegation headed by the country's defence minister, Rustem Umerov.

These, he said, were ""technical"" discussions, focusing on how best to safeguard energy facilities and critical infrastructure.

After the meeting, Umerov described the talks as ""productive"" in a post on X and said they were working to make Zelensky's goal of securing ""a just and lasting peace"" a reality.

Black Sea shipping lanes are also under discussion, with Russia reportedly keen to revive a deal that allowed Ukraine to export grain from its ports without being attacked, in exchange for relief on sanctions.

Both sides, Russia and Ukraine, have carried out hugely destructive attacks on each other's infrastructure - with a marked distinction.

Moscow has sought to plunge Ukraine's population into cold and darkness by targeting its electricity generation, while Kyiv has become increasingly successful in its long-range drone strikes that have struck Russian oil facilities critical to its war effort.

President Trump wants a quick end to this war, Europe's worst since 1945 and one which has led to combined casualties on both sides of hundreds of thousands of killed, captured, wounded or missing men.

Ukraine's leadership, still bruised from that catastrophic row in the Oval Office last month, is trying hard to convince Washington it is not the obstacle to peace.

When the Americans proposed a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire on land, sea and in the air at talks in Jeddah this month, Ukraine quickly agreed to the terms.

The ball, said the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the time, was now in Russia's court.

But despite the US failure to get Moscow to agree to that ceasefire, the Trump administration is putting little or no pressure, at least not in public, on Russia to fall into line. In fact, quite the opposite.

In an interview this weekend with the pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson, Steve Witkoff, the man spearheading the US drive for a ceasefire, appeared to take a stance totally at odds with that of Europe.

Ukraine, he suggested, was ""a false country"", Russia had been provoked and Putin was a man of his word who could be trusted.

Witkoff, a former New York real estate developer and golfing partner of Donald Trump, alsodismissed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's effortsto put together a military force to help safeguard an eventual peace deal in Ukraine, calling it ""a posture and a pose"".

Tate brothers report to Romanian police after return from US,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xky7rn75o,BBC,"Will Vernon, Rachel Hagan",24-03-25,"British-American influencer Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan have appeared at a police station after returning to Romania from the US.

The brothers registered with the authorities in the capital, Bucharest, in a legal formality to demonstrate their compliance with an ongoing criminal investigation.

They are under investigation in Romania for forming an organised criminal group, human trafficking, trafficking of minors and money laundering. Andrew also faces allegations of rape and sex with a minor. The pair deny all accusations.

After leaving the police station, Andrew, 38, refused to say whether he would remain in Romania, but vowed to clear his name both there and in the UK.

The brothers returned to Romania on Friday nearly a month after they unexpectedly had their travel ban lifted by the authorities.

Soon after, the pair announced they flew on a private jet to Florida - where they quickly became the focus of a new investigation.

Florida's state attorney-general launched a criminal inquiry into the brothers, welcomed by the US National Centre on Sexual Exploitation, which represents one of Tate's alleged victims.

The brothers' exit from Romania led to speculation that prosecutors felt political pressure from President Donald Trump - whom they support. Trump has denied any knowledge of their release and the Tates have dismissed claims of outside influence.

Replying to a question about the US charges today, Andrew denied them and said: ""I am investigated everywhere on the planet, because I am one of the most important people on the planet.""

He also said there was a ""witch hunt"" against him.

The pair were arrested in Romania in late 2022 amid accusations of misleading women and transporting them to Romania where they were later sexually exploited and subjected to physical violence.

The pair are also the subjects of a separate investigation in the UK into allegations of rape and human trafficking, which they deny.

British authorities have secured a warrant over allegations of sexual aggression dating back to 2012, meaning the brothers could face extradition once Romanian proceedings conclude.

Last month, Romanian authorities warned the Tates they must return for a court appearance or risk ""a higher custodial measure"".

Andrew, who has been banned from several social media platforms for his misogynistic views and hate speech, later told his 10 million followers on X that he had spent $185,000 (£142,800) on a private jet to ""sign one single piece of paper in Romania"".

The BBC asked Andrew on Monday about his inflammatory tweets in the aftermath of the Southport attack in the UK last year in which three girls at a summer holiday dance and yoga class were stabbed to death and he falsely claimed the attacker was an illegal immigrant. Tate called the BBC correspondent ""a nobody"" before being driven away.

'I scarred my six children by using skin-lightening creams',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92g4n3v78o,BBC,Madina Maishanu,24-03-25,"A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.

The 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.

Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.

Another was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.

Her toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.

""My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,"" Fatima says.

She says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.

At first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time.

But then the burns and scars appeared.

Skin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.

Women in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).

In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.

The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.

Other ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.

Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.

The skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.

The situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.

It is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.

""A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,"" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology spa in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.

She estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.

Some were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.

One of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.

However, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.

So users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.

Fatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.

""They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,"" she says.

They have both lost potential fiancés because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.

I visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves ""mixologists"" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.

The market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold.

Some pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.

I noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.

Other sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.

I also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.

One woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.

""Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,"" she said.

One seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies ""glow"", or to look ""radiant and shiny"".

Most seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.

One salesman said he used ""a lot of kojic"" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.

The approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.

I even saw salesmen giving women injections.

Dr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.

He also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.

But he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.

""Some of them are just being transported in unlabelled containers, so if you do not take them to the labs for evaluation, you can't tell what is inside.""

Fatima says her actions will haunt her forever, especially if her children's scars do not fade.

""When I confided in my mum about what I did, due to her behaviour, and when she heard the dangers of the cream and what stigma her grandchildren are facing, she was sad that they had to go through that and apologised,"" she says.

Fatima is determined to help other parents avoid making the same mistake.

""Even though I have stopped... the side-effects are still here, I beg other parents to use my situation as an example.""

Israel kills Hamas official being treated at Gaza hospital,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3y046q91no,BBC,Rushdi Abu Alouf,23-03-25,"An Israeli air strike on a hospital in Gaza killed a senior Hamas leader and an aide on Sunday evening, a Hamas official told the BBC.

Ismail Barhoum, the head of the group's financial affairs, was killed in the strike on Nasser Hospital, the main medical facility in Khan Younis.

He was receiving treatment at the hospital after being wounded in an air strike four days ago, the official said.

Israel's military said it had struck a key Hamas member operating inside the hospital compound following ""an extensive intelligence-gathering process"" and said that ""precise munitions"" had been used to mitigate harm.

The Hamas-run health ministry said ""many others"", including medical personnel, were injured.

The health ministry said on Monday morning that at least 61 people had been killed in Gaza by Israel over the preceding 24 hours.

It said 730 had been killed since Israel resumed bombing on 18 March.

Meanwhile a 75-year-old man was killed and a 20-year-old soldier was injured in what Israeli police said was a terror attack at a junction near the northern city of Haifa on Monday morning.

They said the assailant rammed his vehicle into a bus stop, then stabbed and opened fire at people before being shot dead by officers.

In Gaza, the department in Nasser Hospital that was hit was evacuated after a large portion was destroyed, the health ministry said.

Footage verified by the BBC showed people attempting to extinguish a fire after the strike.

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of using hospitals as hiding places for weapons and command centres, which the group denies.

Another Hamas leader, Salah al-Bardaweel, was killed by a separate Israeli air strike in Khan Younis on Sunday, an official told the BBC.

Israel resumed its military campaign in Gaza last Tuesday, ending a ceasefire that lasted almost two months.

Israel blamed Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the truce. Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of abandoning the original deal agreed in January.

The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 others taken hostage.

Israel responded to the 7 October attack with a military offensive in Gaza to destroy Hamas, which has killed more than 50,000 people, the Hamas-run health ministry said.

Greenland condemns planned visits by Usha Vance and Trump adviser,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0718g3jwo,BBC,James FitzGerald,24-03-25,"Greenland's politicians have condemned plans for high-profile US visits, in the wake of President Donald Trump's threats to take over the island.

Second Lady Usha Vance will make a cultural visit this week, and a separate trip is expected from Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.

Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Mute Egede described the plan as aggressive, and said the duo had not been invited for meetings. Meanwhile, the island's likely next leader accused the US of showing a lack of respect.

Greenland - the world's biggest island, situated between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans - has been controlled by Denmark, nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away, for about 300 years.

It governs its own domestic affairs, but decisions on foreign and defence policy are made in Copenhagen. The US has long held a security interest - and has had a military base on the island since World War Two.

It is also thought Trump is interested in the island's rare earth minerals. His son Donald Jr visited Greenland before Trump's inauguration in January.

Announcing Mrs Vance's visit, the White House said the second lady would visit historical sites and attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland's national dogsled race.

Her delegation - including her son - would be there to ""celebrate Greenlandic culture and unity"", the statement said.

Waltz's trip was confirmed by a source who spoke to the BBC's US partner, CBS News. He is expected to visit before Mrs Vance and to travel with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, according to the New York Times.

Outgoing PM Egede described Waltz's visit in particular as a provocation. ""What is the security advisor doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to show a demonstration of power to us,"" he told Sermitsiaq newspaper.

Speaking to the same paper, Greenland's probable next PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen accused the American officials of showing the local population a lack of respect.

Trump appeared to escalate his campaign to take over the island during a conversation with Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte earlier this month.

Greenland was already on the defensive about Trump's talk of a takeover, but he sent further shockwaves by implying he might ask to take the island with support of Nato, a military alliance of which Denmark is also a part.

""You know, Mark, we need that for international security... we have a lot of our favourite players cruising around the coast, and we have to be careful,"" Trump said. ""We'll be talking to you.""

When asked about the prospect of annexation, Trump said: ""I think that will happen.""

The move prompted Greenland's leading political parties to issue a joint statement to condemn the American president's ""unacceptable behaviour"".

The issue took centre-stage in the recent election, during which Egede's governing Inuit Ataqatigiit party was defeated in a surprise result by Nielsen's Democratic party, which favours a gradual approach to independence from Denmark.

Earlier this month, during a speech to the US Congress, Trump said he strongly supported the people of Greenland's right to determine their own future. ""If you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America,"" he said.

According to recent polls, almost 80% of Greenlanders back independence from Denmark. But an opinion survey in January suggested an even greater number rejected the idea of becoming part of the US.

Tiger Woods confirms relationship with Trump's ex daughter-in-law,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2n7d03x8xo,BBC,Frances Mao,24-03-25,"Golfer Tiger Woods has announced he is dating Vanessa Trump, the former daughter-in-law of US President Donald Trump.

Vanessa, 47, was married to Donald Trump Jr for 13 years. The pair, who have five children, divorced in 2018.

On Sunday, Woods, 49, posted pictures of Vanessa and himself on social media saying: ""Love is in the air and life is better with you by my side! We look forward to our journey through life together.""

""At this time we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.""

It is unclear what prompted the public announcement, but rumours of their relationship had been reported in gossip magazines in recent weeks.

Woods, who has won 15 major championships, is known for being guarded about his personal life after exposure of his marital infidelities and sex scandals damaged his public standing in the 2000s and affected his playing career.

He admitted himself into a sex addiction rehab clinic, and went through an acrimonious split from his first wife Elin Nordegren months later after six years of marriage. The couple have two children together.

US media outlets report that Tiger Woods' children attend the same school as Vanessa Trump's.

As the former wife of Donald Trump's eldest son, Vanessa had been a regular attendee at official events involving Trump's extended family during his first term in office.

Woods, the former world number one, is also known to have played golf with President Trump on several occasions, including last month. Trump loves golf and owns more than a dozen courses.

In February,Woods attended a meeting with Trumpand Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) heads at the White House about the future of the sport's tournaments and current division with the Saudi Arabia- LIV league.

Woods wore his Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was bestowed on him by Trump in 2019 during the president's first term.

Woods has previously announced relationships with World Cup champion ski racer Lindsey Vonn and Erica Herman, his former restaurant manager.

That relationship ended badly - Herman filed law suits against Woods and his trust in 2023, which she later withdrew.

DNA testing site 23andMe files for bankruptcy protection,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q4r9xy9wro,BBC,Lily Jamali,24-03-25,"Popular DNA testing firm 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy protection, and announced that its co-founder and CEO, Anne Wojcicki, has resigned with immediate effect.

The company will now attempt to sell itself under the supervision of a court.

23andMesaid in a press releasethat it plans to continue operating throughout the sale process and that there ""are no changes to the way the company stores, manages, or protects customer data.""

On Friday, the Attorney General in 23andMe's home state of California issued a consumer alert advising customers to delete their data from the site given the company's ""reported financial distress.""

23andMe's saliva-based test kits were once celebrated among customers and investors, who helped to push the company's value as high as $6bn (£4.6bn).

But it has beenstruggling for survival.

Founded in 2006, the company went public in 2021 but has never turned a profit.

In September, the firm settled a lawsuit alleging that it failed to protect the privacy of nearly seven million customers whose personal information was exposed in a 2023 data breach.

In some cases, hackers gained access to family trees, birth years and geographic locations, by using customers' old passwords. The data stolen did not include DNA records, according to the company.

Two months after the settlement, itcut 200 employees, amounting to 40% of its workforce.

23andMe said its finance chief, Joe Selsavage, will take over as interim chief executive.

Ms Wojcicki will continue to serve as a member of the board.

She had tried to take the company private but was not open to a third-party takeover.

23andMe - which once had high-profile endorsements from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria, and Snoop Dogg - struggled to redefine its business model.

Customers did not have much to return for once they had paid for a DNA report, and an effort to launch a subscription service proved unsuccessful.

Efforts to use its massive trove of data to move into drug development also faltered.

All of the company's directors, except for Ms Wojcickiresignedlast summer, saying in a letter they were quitting after not receiving a satisfactory buyout offer from her.



In its statement on Sunday, 23AndMe's board chair Mark Jensen said the company is ""committed to continuing to safeguard customer data and being transparent about the management of user data going forward"".

He said it would be ""an important consideration in any potential transaction"".

But this may not ease concerns of some users about what happens to the DNA they  shared with the company.

In the UK, it is considered special category data under data protection laws.

This provides legal protections if a firm goes bust or changes hands.

When a DNA testing company called Atlas Biomed appeared to have ceased trading  last year,some customers were left with more questions than answersabout what it meant for them.

Prof Carissa Veliz - author of Privacy is Power - previously told the BBC it is arguably the most valuable personal data you have.

""If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,"" she said.

South Korea court reinstates PM as acting leader,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c625jkyrx6do,BBC,Tessa Wong,24-03-25,"South Korea's constitutional court has dismissed the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating him as the country's acting president.

Han took over as acting leader last December when President Yoon Suk Yeol was suspended from duties and impeached by parliament after he attempted to declare martial law.

However, Han only lasted two weeks in power before lawmakers voted to impeach him as well. Since then, South Korea has been led by deputy prime minister Choi Sang-mok.

South Korea has been roiled by political chaos since Yoon's botched attempt to impose martial law.

Shortly after assuming the role of acting president, Han blocked the appointment of new judges to the constitutional court - something the opposition had hoped would improve the odds of Yoon getting impeached.

As a result, theyvoted to impeach Han.

But on Monday, the judges ruled seven to one to strike down the impeachment.

""I thank the constitutional court for its wise decision,"" Han said after the ruling was announced. ""I will work to bring the government to order.""

South Korea remains on tenterhooks for another upcoming decision by the same court - on the impeachment of President Yoon.

Lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon on 14 December, but it is ultimately up to the constitutional court to decide.

If the court votes to uphold the impeachment, Yoon would be immediately removed from office and South Korea must hold a presidential election within 60 days. If it dismisses the impeachment, Yoon would return to his duties immediately.

The court date has not yet been set for the Yoon verdict, but in recent weeks Seoul has seen swelling protests from Yoon's supporters and opponents, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets of the nation's capital last weekend.

Political analyst Leif-Eric Easley said the dismissal of Han's impeachment shows that the constitutional court ""wants to appear impartial, upholding the law and encouraging national stability during a messy political transition"".

It ""serves to admonish progressive parties for their overzealousness in impeaching government officials"", said Dr Easley. He noted that opposition lawmakers have filed several impeachment motions, and the court has dismissed the nine cases it has ruled on so far.

""Reinstating Han is also partly political theatre setting up its more consequential ruling on Yoon's impeachment."" Dr Easley added.

""Mostly siding with conservatives on Han's case can be seen as a play for unity and legitimacy"" for when the court votes on Yoon's fate in coming days, he said.

Actor Gérard Depardieu's sexual assault trial set to begin,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mnvd95ekeo,BBC,Laura Gozzi,24-03-25,"French actor Gérard Depardieu has appeared in court at the start of a trial on charges of sexual assault.

Depardieu, 76, is accused of sexually abusing two women during a film shoot in 2021.

Prosecutors say he made explicit sexual remarks to, and then aggressively ""groped"", two members of the production team.

If convicted, Depardieu could face five years in jail and a fine of up to €75,000 (£63,000; $81,0000). This is the first case against Depardieu to come to trial, although in total about 20 women have accused him of improper behaviour.

He is the highest-profile figure to face accusations in French cinema's response to the #MeToo movement.

Several dozen protesters were present outside the Paris courthouse on Monday, with many holding up placards in support of victims of sexual assault and chanting feminist slogans.

Depardieu has consistently denied any wrongdoing and, in anopen letter published in French newspaper Le Figaro in 2023, said he had never hurt a woman. ""Hurting a woman would be like kicking my mother in the stomach,"" he wrote.

He added that he was ""neither a rapist nor a predator"" and lamented that it was his word against the ""trial by media and lynching"" that he faced.

Depardieu's lawyer Jérémie Assous said on Monday that his client was ""extremely affected"" by the impending trial but that he was planning on ""letting the truth burst out"".

Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, the lawyer for one of the two plaintiffs, told Reuters that there was ""fear, because he's a cinema giant.""

""It's a struggle between David and Goliath and [the plaintiffs] are afraid of retaliation as they all work in cinema but at a much lower level than Depardieu.""

The trial was due to begin late last year but was postponed because of Depardieu's ill health. His lawyer has said the actor has had quadruple bypass surgery, suffers from diabetes and ""gets exhausted very very quickly"".

However Depardieu has now been deemed fit to stand trial by a medical expert and should appear in court on Monday and Tuesday, although he will be afforded frequent breaks.

French actor Charlotte Arnould was the first woman to file a criminal complaint against Depardieu, in 2018. An investigation is under way.

Despite the mounting allegations, Depardieu - a towering figure of French cinema - has received strong messages of support from some members of France's artistic community.

A group of more than 50 actors, directors and producers including Charlotte Rampling and Carla Bruni said accusations against Depardieu were ""an attack on art itself"" in a letter published in 2023.

The same year, French President Emmanuel Macron also attracted anger when he said that Depardieu was ""a great actor"" who ""made France proud"".

Campaigners said the comments undermined efforts to protect women from violence.

Actress Léa Seydoux called Macron's comments ""crazy"", adding that it ""gives a very bad image for France"".

The trial is due to run on Monday and Tuesday, and a verdict will be announced in several weeks.

Man jailed after rape caught on washing machine reflection,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4drnd404o,BBC,Joel Guinto,24-03-25,"A high court in South Korea has upheld the conviction of a 24-year-old man for a series of sexual crimes, including rape - after the attack was reflected on a washing machine door and caught on security footage, say reports.

The CCTV video submitted by the victim did not appear to show the crime - until investigators spotted the attack in the door's reflection.

The man had already been indicted for other offenses, including the suspected rape of a former girlfriend and sex with a minor, reports say.

He was originally convicted and sentenced to eight years in jail in November but appealed the decision. The high court then sentenced him to seven years, saying that it took into account the settlement that he had reached with one of the victims.

The man was also required to wear an ankle tag for seven years after his release and has been banned from working in facilities for children, juveniles and disabled people for seven years.

Five things to look for in Canada's election,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07zxy98g45o,BBC,Jessica Murphy,24-03-25,"Canada's general election campaign is under way, a 36-day sprint taking place in unprecedented circumstances.

Voters will consider which party should govern the country just as the US - its neighbour and largest economic partner - launches a trade war and President Donald Trump muses about making Canada the 51st US state.

Domestic issues like housing and immigration will still be important, of course, but for the first time in decades, Canadians will also be grappling with fundamental questions about the country's future when they head to the ballot box on 28 April.

Here are five things to watch as the campaign unfolds.

Canada and the US share deeply integrated economies, a long-standing security partnership and the longest ""undefended"" border in the world.

So when President Donald Trump says he wants to use ""economic force"" against America's neighbour, calls the border an ""artificially drawn line"" and imposes steep tariffs, it marks a profound shift in the relationship between the two allies.

""It is impossible to overstate the impact of the president's actions on Canadian politics, on Canadian psyche, on Canadian business,"" said Marci Surkes, chief strategy officer at public affairs firm Compass Rose and a former policy director to ex-prime minister Justin Trudeau, a Liberal.

Trump's interventions have already reshaped politics in Canada, helping transform what seemed like a certain Conservative victory into a too-close-to-call battle with the Liberals.

And on Sunday, as campaigning began, all the party leaders focused their launch messages heavily on the US threats.

What the US president says and does over the next few weeks will inevitably factor into the race. On April 2, for example, in just the second week of campaigning, the White House is expected to announce more global tariffs.

He has already started to make his views on the election known, telling Fox News host Laura Ingraham on 18 March that Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is ""stupidly, no friend of mine"" and that it may be ""easier to deal actually with a Liberal"".

Ultimately, he added, who wins ""doesn't matter to me at all"".

Canadians know their next PM will have no choice but to deal with Donald Trump.

So the question on many voters' minds is: who can most capably handle the unpredictable US president?

The contest essentially boils down to the new Liberal leader Mark Carney and Poilievre, who has led the Conservatives since 2022.

Two other major parties will be contesting seats in Parliament - the left-leaning New Democrats (NDP) and the the Bloc Québécois - but Canadians have historically elected Conservative or Liberal governments.

Carney, 60, is a former central banker who is new to politics - after taking over from Justin Trudeau earlier this month, he became the first prime minister in Canada never elected to Parliament.

He brings experience on the world stage - he governed the Bank of England from 2013-2020 -  but lacks time spent in the cut and thrust of political campaigning, and will get his first real test in this general election.

If the Liberals fail to win the election, he could have the shortest tenure of any PM in the country's history.

At 45, Poilievre may be significantly younger, but he is a political veteran. First elected to the House of Commons at age 25, he has two decades of experience in federal politics, including time in cabinet, and is known for his political acumen.

As party leader, he was quick to highlight the pain that inflation was inflicting on Canadian families, and capitalise on broader anger at Trudeau and the Liberals on issues like immigration.

His tag line ""Canada is broken"" has in recent weeks become ""Canada first"". The shift in message from a country in decline to one of patriotism and strength comes as he presents himself as able to stand up to Trump.

He is ""the consummate retail politician"",  Ms Surkes said, but ""suffers from having - right now -  a brand and a narrative that no longer fits the moment"".

It will be the first time in decades that a Canadian election is not focused mostly on domestic issues.

Instead, this election is about the big, national questions: Canada's sovereignty and what the country must do to face an uncertain future with uncertain allies.

Ms Surkes compared the situation to the 1988 elecftion, when Canada's relationship with the US also took centre stage as the country mulled joining the North American Free Trade Agreement.

""The same types of questions were being asked in terms of whether there would be a forfeiture of Canadian sovereignty, economic sovereignty, economic independence,"" she said.

This time, both main parties are pushing a vision of growth and independence - building much-needed housing, moving forward on major energy and resource projects, retaliating against US tariffs and bolstering Canada's defence capabilities.

So where are the differences?

Carney has moved the Liberals more towards the political centre as he seeks to distance himself from Trudeau, who left office deeply unpopular.

He has promised to ""spend less and invest more"" and to boost capital investments in things like housing, and military infrastructure and computing resources.

Poilievre, a fiscal hawk, pitches cutting red tape and taxes to boost industry and spur infrastructure investment and home building.

The Conservatives have also focused more sharply on issues like crime.

The core domestic concerns that Canadians have had in recent years - affordability, housing, healthcare - haven't gone away.

But pollster David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, says they have been subsumed by the ""existential threat"" of the trade war with the US.

""Even if the cost of living is still the top issue, it may not be as powerful a motivator to drive voting behavior,"" he adds.

So the parties will be challenged to come up with convincing policies to address these concerns - but frame them in the context of the wider economic threat.

The US tariffs, the uncertainty caused by their on-again-off-again nature, and Canada's C$60bn in counter-tariffs, are already being felt by businesses and communities across the country.

This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development more than halved its economic growth outlook for Canada this year and next.

National opinion polls have seen a stunning reversal in recent weeks, with the Conservatives losing the 20-point lead they had over the Liberals for the better part of a year.

As the race officially begins, it's a toss-up.

Mr Coletto said three factors led to the ""perfect storm"" in polling: the resignation of the deeply unpopular Trudeau, the Liberal leadership race which that sparked, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House.

Both candidates now are trying to ""bring their enemies to the battlefield"" to eke out an advantage, he added. Carney is seeking to paint Poilievre as ""Trump-light"", while Poilievre suggests Carney is ""just like Justin"".

Each campaign enjoys natural advantages, he says.

The Conservatives have ""an animated base who desperately want a change in government"", along with a well-funded political machine.

The Liberals currently ""have the advantage on narrative"" that has helped shift the polls more in their favour.

The other two official parties - the NDP and the Bloc - have both seen their popularity diminish.

The left-leaning NDP, which had 24 seats in the last Parliament, helped prop up the Liberal minority government in recent years in exchange for support for progressive policies like dental care for low-income Canadians.

But leader Jagmeet Singh has been pushing hard against Carney, seeking to frame him as someone who will ""protect billionaires and big business"".

Bloc leader Blanchet said on Sunday he would fight for Quebec companies and workers struggling under US tariffs, especially in the aluminium industry.

"Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: What’s coming up this week",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr2px2ljlro,BBC,Noor Nanji,23-03-25,"This week,Million Dollar Secrethits our screens - it's being dubbed Netflix's answer to The Traitors.

But that's not all the week has in store.

InZoi, a new game seen as a direct competitor to The Sims, is coming out,Mumford & Sonsare back with a new album, andHolland- starring Nicole Kidman - drops on Amazon Prime.

Read on for this week's biggest releases...

I've just about recovered from the drama of The Traitors, but Netflix is here with its own version to fill that void.

Million Dollar Secret, a competition reality show, drops on Wednesday

So here’s the premise. Twelve strangers enter a fancy lakeside estate. In each of their rooms is a mysterious welcome gift - a box. Eleven are empty, and one contains (you guessed it) a million dollars.

The cash is for that guest to keep, as long as they keep their identity hidden. But a series of games will reveal clues about who they are.

When the trailerdropped on YouTube, people were quick to spot the similarities with The Traitors.

I’ve had a sneak preview, and can confirm there are alotof parallels - from the awkward group meals, to the tearful revelations of why they really, really need the money.

One thing it doesn’t have, though, is Claudia and her enviable wardrobe. Instead, it’s hosted by British actor Peter Serafinowicz, who told me the game would be “high stakes” with “endless twists”.

By Tom Gerken, tech reporter

Has there ever really been a game to rival The Sims, the virtual dollhouse game that lets you design your own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs?

It has been a hit for 25 years now - but perhaps a challenger has emerged, or so the online hype would have you believe.

InZoiis in effect The Sims, with many similar features but one massive difference - far more realistic and even, at times, lifelike graphics.

The developers want the game to simulate life like never before - with open worlds you can walk (and drive) around, as well as jobs you'll actively play yourself.

Will it be a hit? We'll have to wait to find that out - but after two years of teases and trailers, PC gamers will finally get their hands on the game when it launches in early access form on Friday.

By Mark Savage, music correspondent

Mumford & Sons have timed their comeback perfectly.

Their fifth album, Rushmere, arrives on Friday - just as the Americana sound they championed enjoys a revival, and newcomers like Myles Smith are citing the band as an influence.

Recorded over two years in Nashville and Devon, it finds the group returning to their rustic roots. Guitars are plucked, fiddles are fiddled, and brows are furrowed as Marcus Mumford navigates his mid-30s, and the reorganisation of friendships and priorities that mid-life brings.

Highlights include the understated campfire ballad Monochrome, and the spiky Truth (""I refuse to offer myself up to men who lie""), which is underpinned by a surprisingly nimble bassline.

Named after the pond on Wimbledon Common where they formed, it's a fairly cautious return, presumably designed to remind people of why they fell for the band in the first place. There's certainly nothing as experimental aslast year's one-off single, Good People, recorded with Pharrell Williams.

But Marcus Mumford says they recorded more than 60 songs during the sessions, which he called ""the most prolific two years of our life"", and there are plans to release the extra material in one form or another. Watch this space.

Nicole Kidman is the queen of creepy thrillers.

She’s back inHolland, which drops on Amazon Prime on Thursday, and also stars Succession’s Matthew Macfadyen.

The film’s trailer shows Kidman living a Stepford Wives-style life in a small town, with a forced smile as she declares “it’s just perfect”.

But things quickly unravel and secrets, paranoia and suspicion start to mount.

Reviews have been mixed. The Guardian gave itjust two stars, calling it a “disappointing mess”, while the Hollywood Reporter called it“stylish but plodding”.

But the Evening Standard was more optimistic. “Forget Babygirl, this is the Nicole Kidman movie to watch,”it writes.

Why Britain turned its back on clubbing,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czed9321l37o,BBC,"Lucy Woodham, George Hemmati",23-03-25,"In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her ""favourite place"".

""This is a landmark of Sheffield,"" says one reveller. ""It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,"" adds another.

Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are ""the vital underbelly of everything"".

""It's where people find themselves,"" he says. ""It's where people find their tribe.""

Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the ""rave generation"", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.

And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are ""dropping like flies"".

In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain – more than a third of the total number.

In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.

""A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,"" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.

There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.

But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did

And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?

For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.

A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.

Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors – both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and ""we are seeing less of a drinking culture"".

A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.

Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. ""Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.""

There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.

When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. ""[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.""

Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, ""social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up"".

This rings true with Mr Rigg. ""We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,"" he argues.

But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. ""I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.""

There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's ""some damage as well"".

""[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills – not even bravery – to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.""

""It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness"".

Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. ""The reality is, is people can't afford it"".

Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around £10, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.

In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.

""Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,"" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. ""You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.""

Mr Rigg suggests there is a ""storm"" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.

If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.

In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.

Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. ""People really care about how they spend their money,"" he argues. ""Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week"".

The company now has several ""party bars"" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.

The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.

But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.

The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, ""value for money"".

There are also other models of clubbing that are seeing some success.

Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.

Co-founder Katie Matthews says: ""The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.""

Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.

""It's about safety of members,"" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.

Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.

""For some people it's almost the only place they've got where they can go and feel a sense of belonging and real community,"" he says.

Cat Rossi has spent years researching the creative significance of nightclubs, in her capacity as a design historian and professor of architecture at University for the Creative Arts Canterbury. ""Since the dawn of civilisation we've needed to go out and dance and be together at night,"" she says. ""Social gathering is a core part of our social fabric.

""I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.""

Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a ""bigger creative ecosystem"" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.



In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.

The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its ""intangible cultural heritage"" in partnership with Unesco.

It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: ""They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.""

And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.

""Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.""

But without that transformation, the UK risks losing more of them.

The man with a mind-reading chip in his brain - thanks to Elon Musk,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewk49j7j1po,BBC,"Lara Lewington, Liv McMahon, Tom Gerken",23-03-25,"Having a chip in your brain that can translate your thoughts into computer commands may sound like science fiction - but it is a reality for Noland Arbaugh.

In January 2024 - eight years after he was paralysed - the 30-year-old became the first person to get such a device from the US neurotechnology firm, Neuralink.

It was not the first such chip - a handful of other companies have also developed and implanted them - but Noland's inevitably attracts more attention because of Neuralink's founder: Elon Musk.

But Noland says the important thing is neither him nor Musk - but the science.

He told the BBC he knew the risks of what he was doing - but ""good or bad, whatever may be, I would be helping"".

""If everything worked out, then I could help being a participant of Neuralink,"" he said.

""If something terrible happened, I knew they would learn from it.""

Noland, who is from Arizona, was paralysed below the shoulders in a diving accident in 2016.

His injuries were so severe he feared he might not be able to study, work or even play games again.

""You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,"" he said.

""You have to learn that you have to rely on other people for everything.""

The Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind.

It is what is known as a brain computer interface (BCI) - which works by detecting the tiny electrical impulses generated when humans think about moving, and translating these into digital command, such as moving a cursor on a screen.

It is a complex subject that scientists have been working on for several decades.

Inevitably, Elon Musk's involvement in the field has catapulted the tech - and Noland Arbaugh - into the headlines.

It's helped Neuralink attract lots of investment - as well as scrutiny over the safety and significance of what is an extremely invasive procedure.

When Noland's implant was announced,experts hailed it as a ""significant milestone"", while also cautioning that it would take time to really assess - especially given Musk's adeptness at ""generating publicity for his company.""

Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: ""Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.""

In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.

""I think he was just as excited as I was to get started,"" he said.

Nonetheless, he stresses that Neuralink is about more than its owner, and claims he does not consider it ""an Elon Musk device"".

Whether the rest of the world sees it that way -especially given his increasingly controversial role in the US government- remains to be seen.

But there is no questioning the impact the device has had on Noland's life.

When Noland awoke from the surgery which installed the device, he said he was initially able to control a cursor on a screen by thinking about wiggling his fingers.

""Honestly I didn't know what to expect - it sounds so sci-fi,"" he said.

But after seeing his neurons spike on a screen - all the while surrounded by excited Neuralink employees - he said ""it all sort of sunk in"" that he could control his computer with just his thoughts.

And - even better - over time his ability to use the implant has grown to the point he can now play chess and video games.

""I grew up playing games,"" he said - adding it was something he ""had to let go of"" when he became disabled.

""Now I'm beating my friends at games, which really shouldn't be possible but it is.""

Noland is a powerful demonstration of the tech's potential to change lives - but there may be drawbacks too.

""One of the main problems is privacy,"" said Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience, University of Sussex.

""So if we are exporting our brain activity [...] then we are kind of allowing access to not just what we do but potentially what we think, what we believe and what we feel,"" he told the BBC.

""Once you've got access to stuff inside your head, there really is no other barrier to personal privacy left.""

But these aren't concerns for Noland - instead he wants to see the chips go further in terms of what they can do.

He told the BBC he hoped the device could eventually allow him to control his wheelchair, or even a futuristic humanoid robot.

Even with the tech in its current, more limited state, it hasn't all been smooth sailing though.

At one point, an issue with the device caused him to lose control of his computer altogether, when it partially disconnected from his brain.

""That was really upsetting to say the least,"" he said.

""I didn't know if I would be able to use Neuralink ever again.""

The connection was repaired - and subsequently improved - when engineers adjusted the software, but it highlighted a concern frequently voiced by experts over the technology's limitations.

Neuralink is just one of many companies exploring how to digitally tap into our brain power.

Synchron is one such firm, which says its Stentrode device aimed at helping people with  motor neurone disease requires a less invasive surgery to implant.

Rather than requiring open brain surgery, it is installed into a person's jugular vein in their neck, then moved up to their brain through a blood vessel.

Like Neuralink, the device ultimately connects to the motor region of the brain.

""It picks up when someone is thinking of tapping or not tapping their finger,"" said chief technology officer Riki Bannerjee.

""By being able to pick up those differences it can create what we call a digital motor output.""

That output is then turned into computer signals, where it is currently being used by 10 people.

One such person, who did not want his last name to be used, told the BBC he was the first person in the world to use the device with Apple's Vision Pro headset.

Mark said this has allowed him to virtually holiday in far-flung locations - from standing in waterfalls in Australia to strolling across mountains in New Zealand.

""I can see down the road in the future a world where this technology could really, really make a difference for someone that has this or any paralysis,"" he said.

But for Noland there is one caveat with his Neuralink chip - he agreed to be part of a study which installed it for six years, after which point the future is less clear.

Whatever happens to him, he believes his experience may be merely scratching the surface of what might one day become a reality.

""We know so little about the brain and this is allowing us to learn so much more,"" he said.

Five things to look for in Canada's election,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c07zxy98g45o,BBC,Jessica Murphy,24-03-25,"Canada's general election campaign is under way, a 36-day sprint taking place in unprecedented circumstances.

He brings experience on the world stage - he governed the Bank of England from 2013-2020 -  but lacks time spent in the cut and thrust of political campaigning, and will get his first real test in this general election.

If the Liberals fail to win the election, he could have the shortest tenure of any PM in the country's history.

At 45, Poilievre may be significantly younger, but he is a political veteran. First elected to the House of Commons at age 25, he has two decades of experience in federal politics, including time in cabinet, and is known for his political acumen.

As party leader, he was quick to highlight the pain that inflation was inflicting on Canadian families, and capitalise on broader anger at Trudeau and the Liberals on issues like immigration.

His tag line ""Canada is broken"" has in recent weeks become ""Canada first"". The shift in message from a country in decline to one of patriotism and strength comes as he presents himself as able to stand up to Trump.

He is ""the consummate retail politician"",  Ms Surkes said, but ""suffers from having - right now -  a brand and a narrative that no longer fits the moment"".

It will be the first time in decades that a Canadian election is not focused mostly on domestic issues.

Instead, this election is about the big, national questions: Canada's sovereignty and what the country must do to face an uncertain future with uncertain allies.

Ms Surkes compared the situation to the 1988 elecftion, when Canada's relationship with the US also took centre stage as the country mulled joining the North American Free Trade Agreement.

""The same types of questions were being asked in terms of whether there would be a forfeiture of Canadian sovereignty, economic sovereignty, economic independence,"" she said.

This time, both main parties are pushing a vision of growth and independence - building much-needed housing, moving forward on major energy and resource projects, retaliating against US tariffs and bolstering Canada's defence capabilities.

So where are the differences?

Carney has moved the Liberals more towards the political centre as he seeks to distance himself from Trudeau, who left office deeply unpopular.

He has promised to ""spend less and invest more"" and to boost capital investments in things like housing, and military infrastructure and computing resources.

Poilievre, a fiscal hawk, pitches cutting red tape and taxes to boost industry and spur infrastructure investment and home building.

The Conservatives have also focused more sharply on issues like crime.

The core domestic concerns that Canadians have had in recent years - affordability, housing, healthcare - haven't gone away.

But pollster David Coletto, CEO of Abacus Data, says they have been subsumed by the ""existential threat"" of the trade war with the US.

""Even if the cost of living is still the top issue, it may not be as powerful a motivator to drive voting behavior,"" he adds.

So the parties will be challenged to come up with convincing policies to address these concerns - but frame them in the context of the wider economic threat.

The US tariffs, the uncertainty caused by their on-again-off-again nature, and Canada's C$60bn in counter-tariffs, are already being felt by businesses and communities across the country.

This week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development more than halved its economic growth outlook for Canada this year and next.

National opinion polls have seen a stunning reversal in recent weeks, with the Conservatives losing the 20-point lead they had over the Liberals for the better part of a year.

As the race officially begins, it's a toss-up.

Mr Coletto said three factors led to the ""perfect storm"" in polling: the resignation of the deeply unpopular Trudeau, the Liberal leadership race which that sparked, and the return of Donald Trump to the White House.

Both candidates now are trying to ""bring their enemies to the battlefield"" to eke out an advantage, he added. Carney is seeking to paint Poilievre as ""Trump-light"", while Poilievre suggests Carney is ""just like Justin"".

Each campaign enjoys natural advantages, he says.

The Conservatives have ""an animated base who desperately want a change in government"", along with a well-funded political machine.

The Liberals currently ""have the advantage on narrative"" that has helped shift the polls more in their favour.

The other two official parties - the NDP and the Bloc - have both seen their popularity diminish.

The left-leaning NDP, which had 24 seats in the last Parliament, helped prop up the Liberal minority government in recent years in exchange for support for progressive policies like dental care for low-income Canadians.

But leader Jagmeet Singh has been pushing hard against Carney, seeking to frame him as someone who will ""protect billionaires and big business"".

Bloc leader Blanchet said on Sunday he would fight for Quebec companies and workers struggling under US tariffs, especially in the aluminium industry.

"Faith comes before football, says Premier League star Ouattara",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/ckg8enx9j8no,BBC,Ian Williams,24-03-25,"This video can not be played

Dango Ouattara prays before and after every game he plays, in addition to his five regular daily prayers

""For me, faith comes first. It comes before football.""

As Ramadan draws to a close, Bournemouth's Dango Ouattara is clear where his priorities lie.

The forward from Burkina Faso is a devout Muslim who prays five times a day, as well as before and after each game he plays, saying it helps him to ""stay humble"".

""It allows us to refocus on ourselves, to see what we've done well and what we haven't been able to do well,"" the 23-year-old tells BBC Sport Africa when we meet at his local mosque in Poole.

""It also allows us to correct ourselves in society too. It allows us to stay on the right path.""

During our conversation, Ouattara regularly uses words such as ""calm"" and ""stable"" to describe the benefits of Islam.

A quiet and thoughtful character, verging on shy, there is nothing bling about him. He arrives early for our interview, dressed head-to-toe in white, asking to pray before we settle down to chat.

""Faith allows me to overcome many challenges, to respect others, to respect choices and religions too,"" he explains.

""Whether it's on the pitch, off it with friends or even with my family, it allows me to be calm in my daily life.

""You have to believe before you can do something.""

'Fans are living through Bournemouth's best period - enjoy the ride'

Bournemouth's Semenyo motivated by trial rejections

This season, Ouattara seems full of belief in his own abilities.

Despite not being a consistent starter, he has nine goals in 30 appearances in all competitions for the Cherries, includinga hat-trick against Nottingham Forestin January.

Those numbers are a vast improvement on last season, when he only scored once.

With Andoni Iraola's side potentially challenging for European football, Ouattara says the team is ""great fun"" to play in.

""The secret this year is that we've had the same squad, virtually the same players and the same coach. It's important to have a group that continues to develop together,"" he added.

""You can see every time that the players enjoy it.

""We're going to do everything we can to go further.""

Born in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Ouattara himself has been on a journey, having arrived on England's south coast via French side Lorient.

Signedfor Â£20m ($26m),when he made his debut in January 2023 he became only the second Burkinabe to appear in the Premier League, following on from his national team captain and former Aston Villa forward Bertrand Traore.

Still uncomfortable speaking in English for prolonged periods, he confirms language was the main problem when he arrived, but says religion played its part there too.

""My agent and I were able to find the mosque, so I started to get back into my routine,"" he explains.

""And as I came to the mosque, everything went well for me with the football. So I found myself back in the environment I'd left behind in Lorient.

""It helps because when you find yourself in another town, having the community shows that you're not alone. You have the opportunity to pray with other people, to meet new people.

""It keeps us focused on religion.""

Ouattara tries to visit his local mosque in Poole as often as his training schedule allows

This year, Ramadan began on Friday 28 February and will finish on Sunday 30 March.

The month is considered holy as Muslims believe it marks when the Quran was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.

For adherents, fasting plays a key role, foregoing food and drink between sunrise and sunset.

""I wouldn't say that Ramadan is difficult, it's more mental, because personally I'm used to doing it,"" says Ouattara.

""It's more the lack of water. And given that you have to wake up at unusual times to eat, that's more tiring.""

But he has a cunning plan to combat the fatigue: naps.

""I wake up at 4.30am, I do my ablutions and I've already got the food which has already been prepared by the club chef.

""I eat, and after prayers I have time to go back to bed for an hour or so before training.

""Then after the sessions I say my prayers and sleep for another hour. So the fact that I rest each time means I recover better.""

'Faith before work' - Doucoure's life as a Muslim player

'Ramadan is a time to enjoy what you have' Video, 00:03:50'Ramadan is a time to enjoy what you have'

Despite his fast, and when he is not napping, Ouattara's training plan remains pretty much the same.

""It's even easier when you have the support of the whole team, whether it's the players or the staff,"" he said.

""Everyone asks me 'How are you feeling? Is it going well? Is it not too difficult?'

""They understand me and they encourage me.""

Although he is the only Muslim in Bournemouth's squad, Ouattara is far from alone as a Premier League player fasting during Ramadan.

Indeed, the month has become so high profile thatin 2021the league introduced a new agreement that allows officials to call a halt to games in progress at sunset to allow players to break their fast.

It is something for which Ouattara is grateful.

""The initiative of the Premier League is to be congratulated because it's not easy to play while fasting,"" he added.

""We hope that it will continue.""

Dango Ouattara is someone who hears the call to prayer strongly, something that has helped turn him into a player Bournemouth fans can have faith in.

What makes a rum Jamaican? Question at heart of Caribbean legal dispute,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo,BBC,Jacob Evans,24-03-25,"Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?

That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called ""Jamaica rum"".

In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.

The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.

The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets – the EU and the US.

It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.

But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.

This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders – the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).

The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.

It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.

And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.

The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.

""What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,"" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.

Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.

Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that ""we were a little bit puzzled"" by the NRJ's objection.

The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.

Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.

The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.

""The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.""

This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.

The second reason is ""they anchor production in that region"". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.

Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and ""opens up other aspects of history and geography"", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.

Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.

Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.

Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.

Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.

The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. ""We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,"" he says.

Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.

Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. ""It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,"" he says.

And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.

In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms ""with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand"".

It concluded: ""When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.""

"Netflix's answer to The Traitors, and a rival to The Sims: What’s coming up this week",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr2px2ljlro,BBC,Noor Nanji,23-03-25,"This week,Million Dollar Secrethits our screens - it's being dubbed Netflix's answer to The Traitors.

But that's not all the week has in store.

InZoi, a new game seen as a direct competitor to The Sims, is coming out,Mumford & Sonsare back with a new album, andHolland- starring Nicole Kidman - drops on Amazon Prime.

Read on for this week's biggest releases...

I've just about recovered from the drama of The Traitors, but Netflix is here with its own version to fill that void.

Million Dollar Secret, a competition reality show, drops on Wednesday

So here’s the premise. Twelve strangers enter a fancy lakeside estate. In each of their rooms is a mysterious welcome gift - a box. Eleven are empty, and one contains (you guessed it) a million dollars.

The cash is for that guest to keep, as long as they keep their identity hidden. But a series of games will reveal clues about who they are.

When the trailerdropped on YouTube, people were quick to spot the similarities with The Traitors.

I’ve had a sneak preview, and can confirm there are alotof parallels - from the awkward group meals, to the tearful revelations of why they really, really need the money.

One thing it doesn’t have, though, is Claudia and her enviable wardrobe. Instead, it’s hosted by British actor Peter Serafinowicz, who told me the game would be “high stakes” with “endless twists”.

By Tom Gerken, tech reporter

Has there ever really been a game to rival The Sims, the virtual dollhouse game that lets you design your own characters, give them personalities and tend to their needs?

It has been a hit for 25 years now - but perhaps a challenger has emerged, or so the online hype would have you believe.

InZoiis in effect The Sims, with many similar features but one massive difference - far more realistic and even, at times, lifelike graphics.

The developers want the game to simulate life like never before - with open worlds you can walk (and drive) around, as well as jobs you'll actively play yourself.

Will it be a hit? We'll have to wait to find that out - but after two years of teases and trailers, PC gamers will finally get their hands on the game when it launches in early access form on Friday.

By Mark Savage, music correspondent

Mumford & Sons have timed their comeback perfectly.

Their fifth album, Rushmere, arrives on Friday - just as the Americana sound they championed enjoys a revival, and newcomers like Myles Smith are citing the band as an influence.

Recorded over two years in Nashville and Devon, it finds the group returning to their rustic roots. Guitars are plucked, fiddles are fiddled, and brows are furrowed as Marcus Mumford navigates his mid-30s, and the reorganisation of friendships and priorities that mid-life brings.

Highlights include the understated campfire ballad Monochrome, and the spiky Truth (""I refuse to offer myself up to men who lie""), which is underpinned by a surprisingly nimble bassline.

Named after the pond on Wimbledon Common where they formed, it's a fairly cautious return, presumably designed to remind people of why they fell for the band in the first place. There's certainly nothing as experimental aslast year's one-off single, Good People, recorded with Pharrell Williams.

But Marcus Mumford says they recorded more than 60 songs during the sessions, which he called ""the most prolific two years of our life"", and there are plans to release the extra material in one form or another. Watch this space.

Nicole Kidman is the queen of creepy thrillers.

She’s back inHolland, which drops on Amazon Prime on Thursday, and also stars Succession’s Matthew Macfadyen.

The film’s trailer shows Kidman living a Stepford Wives-style life in a small town, with a forced smile as she declares “it’s just perfect”.

But things quickly unravel and secrets, paranoia and suspicion start to mount.

Reviews have been mixed. The Guardian gave itjust two stars, calling it a “disappointing mess”, while the Hollywood Reporter called it“stylish but plodding”.

But the Evening Standard was more optimistic. “Forget Babygirl, this is the Nicole Kidman movie to watch,”it writes.

Man who almost 'ate himself to the grave' loses 190 kilogrammes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlx667ed9go,BBC,,24-03-25,"Lying in a hospital bed, Ioan Pollard weighed 45 stone (286kg), his kidney was failing and he did not know if he would even survive the night.

Aged 27 at the time, he needed a transplant but was ineligible for the waiting list due to his weight.

""I really pushed myself as far as I could in terms of how much my body could take,"" said Ioan.

""The hospital staff told me the next eight hours were critical and I may not be here in the morning.""

A new S4C documentary will follow the journalist after he lost 30 stone in order to receive a new kidney and with it, a new life.

A month after his 27th birthday, Ioan almost lost his life.

He had scratches on his leg which had turned septic.

""It was immediately obvious that my kidneys had been severely damaged,"" said Ioan, who lives in Caernarfon, Gwynedd.

""They told me that things didn't look good and that we needed to start talking about dialysis.

""The size and weight of my body meant I had no chance of getting a transplant. The truth is, I was far too fat.""

It was a huge concern for friends and family, especially his mother.

""We were worried about his health. I thought he was going to eat himself to the grave,"" said Eleri Pollard.

Looking back through his clothes from a period where they had be bought from specialist shops, his waist had reached 72 inches.

""I had no self control,"" said Ioan, who is S4C's digital news editor.

""Food controlled everything I did and how I lived my life.

""At the time I didn't accept that I was addicted to food and was overeating but, looking back, I obviously was.""

He added: ""I could be here all day blaming this and that for the situation I was in, but it simply comes down to two things - I was too greedy and too lazy.

""When I look back, I feel embarrassed that I had chosen to live my life like that. It's only now that I realise what I'd done to myself and my body.""

In a period of seven years, with the help of bariatric operations to reduce his stomach and remove skin, he lost more than half his weight - 30 stones (191kg) - he was eligible for a transplant.

It was discovered that his mother was a match and could donate one of her kidneys to her son.

""I want Ioan to live his life, he deserves it,"" she said.

Ioan, now 35, now hopes for a healthier future.

""I've been through so much. I just want this to work without any problems,"" he said.

""It's natural to worry more about mam than myself because mam is putting herself in a vulnerable position to try to improve my life. It all depends on this now.""

Ex-Bangladesh captain Tamim in hospital after cardiac arrest,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cy7xzrldgj1o,BBC,Ben Collins,24-03-25,"Tamim Iqbal played county cricket for Nottinghamshire and Essex

Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal is ""under close observation"" in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest during a domestic T20 game in Dhaka.

The 36-year-old opener, who represented Bangladesh 391 times between 2007 and 2023, was playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club on Monday.

Tamim, Bangladesh's record run-scorer in one-day internationals, complained of chest pains after taking to the field in their Dhaka Premier League fixture against Shinepukur.

Plans to transport him in a helicopter were abandoned as his condition deteriorated and he was instead taken for immediate treatment at a closer facility, the KPJ Specialized Hospital.

""Tamim Iqbal Khan suffered a cardiac arrest this morning at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP),"" read a statement by the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

Tamim received ""immediate emergency medical treatment"" and underwent a ""successful angiogram procedure to address a blockage in one of the arteries of his heart"".

""He is currently under close observation at the hospital's coronary care unit,"" the statement added.

Tamim became only the second Bangladeshi to play county cricket in England with Nottinghamshire in 2011, and also had a spell with Essex in 2017.

He is the only Bangladeshi batter to score centuries in all three international formats.

Pioneering trial could 'switch off' arthritis,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clynp17k23po,BBC,Sharon Barbour,24-03-25,"Patients are taking part in a trial that scientists hope could ultimately lead to a cure for rheumatoid arthritis.

TheAuToDeCRA-2study seeks to prove it is possible to train white blood cell commanders - dubbed the ""generals"" of the immune system - to order other ""soldier"" cells to stop attacking healthy tissues.

Prof John Isaacs, who has worked on the condition for 35 years and is leading the research, believes this could make it possible to ""switch off"" rheumatoid arthritis.

Trial participant Carol Robson, from Jarrow in South Tyneside, says the worst part of living with the disease is the pain, but if the research helps ease suffering ""that would be wonderful"".

The study, funded by the charity Versus Arthritis and the European Commission, is being run by Newcastle University and Newcastle Hospitals.

""It's pioneering,"" Prof Isaacs claims. ""There are only one or two other groups around the world doing similar work.""



In this latest research, now in its second phase, certain cells are isolated from a patient's blood.

Prof Isaacs explained there are different types of cells that come together, rather like an army of soldiers, to attack an infection or disease.

These take instructions from the white blood cells known as dendritic cells, which he refers to as the ""generals"" of the immune system.

When these generals sense danger they become excited and send out the attack signal, but when there is no danger detected they remain calm and instruct the army to ignore healthy tissues.

When this goes wrong it causes diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

Over the course of a week the patient's white blood cells are grown in the lab and trained to resemble the ""calm"" generals so that, when given back to the patient, they command the soldiers to stop attacking the patient's joints.

""In time, this treatment could provide significant benefits to people living with rheumatoid arthritis by 'switching off' the disease,"" Prof Isaacs explains.

Among the estimated 450,000 people in England who live with the condition is 70-year-old former nurse Ms Robson. She wakes up every morning to pain.

Before she was diagnosed she would put her hands in packets of frozen peas in an effort to find some relief.

She now takes immunosuppressants, which she says help a bit, but since being injected with the retrained white blood cells she believes she is in less pain.

""Is this just me hoping it is? But realistically I do think it is better,"" she says.

""If this trial works to switch off rheumatoid arthritis that would be wonderful.

""It's a privilege to be part of something that is actually quite a leap forward - if they get it right.""

The outcome of the Newcastle work is being widely monitored as it could have huge implications for the 18 million rheumatoid arthritis patients worldwide.

Prof Isaacs said, if its successful, the research could also have implications for other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis.

""It's an area of research that we describe as re-education of the immune system.

The first two trials are small - in total about 32 patients have been involved - and more research is needed, but if it shows signs of success another, larger trial will follow.

Even if all goes to plan and the treatment is shown to re-educate the immune system, it may still be another five to 10 years before patients are able to access it.

But Prof Isaacs, who has dedicated his career to the condition, said it would make him and his team immensely proud to have developed the treatment.

K-pop megastars NewJeans announce hiatus after setback in court battle,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr2vplwjeeo,BBC,Gavin Butler,24-03-25,"South Korean K-pop group NewJeans have announced they are taking a break from all activities,after a court ruled against themin their ongoing dispute with their record label Ador.

The five-piece, who have attempted to rebrand as NJZ, announced during a show at ComplexCon Hong Kong on Sunday that ""this will be our last performance for a little while"", after debuting their new song Pit Stop.

The court ruling on Friday forbade the group from organising their own appearances, making music or signing advertising deals during their dispute with Ador.

NewJeans are seeking to cut ties with Ador after accusing them of mistreatment, and have said they will challenge the court's ruling.

The group have been embroiled in a lengthy dispute with their record label since August 2024, when Hybe, the parent company of Ador, allegedly forced out NewJeans' mentor, Min Hee-Jin.

The band issued an ultimatum demanding that Min should be restored – and, when Hybe refused, went public with a number of complaints against the label, including the claim it had deliberately undermined their careers.

One of the group's members, Hanni, also alleged thatshe suffered workplace harassmentwhile working with the label.

In a press conference in November, NewJeans announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists.

The Seoul court ruled that NewJeans' claims did not ""sufficiently prove that Ador violated their significant duty as part of their contract"", adding that the music label had upheld ""most of its duty including payment"".

The court's decision prevents the band from conducting independent activities, which means it will face difficulty rebranding under its new name, NJZ, without facing severe financial penalties for breach of contract.

The Hong Kong concert on Sunday night marked the group's first public appearance since the ruling.

After debuting their new song, the five members Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Heyin took turns to read a letter addressing their fans in English and Korean.

""This stage means so much to us and every single one of you who gives us strength just by being here,"" Hanni and Dani said.

""It is really hard for us to say this, but this might be our last performance for a little while. Out of respect for the court's decision, we've decided to pause all our activities for now.

""It wasn't an easy decision,"" they added, ""but we believe this is something we need to do at this moment.""

The group also said that the decision was ""about protecting ourselves so that we can come back even stronger"".

""We had to speak up to protect the values that we believe in, and that was a choice that we don't regret at all,"" they added.

""We surely believe that standing up for our dignity, our rights and everything we deeply care about is something we had to do, and that belief will not change.""

The speech ended an hour-long headlining set in front of a crowd of more than 11,000 fans at the AsiaWorld Expo Arena, Hong Kong's largest live music venue.

The group performed under their new name NJZ, in seeming defiance of last week's ruling.

In a statement on Monday, Ador said they ""regret the members' decision to proceed with a performance under a name other than NewJeans, despite the court order, and their unilateral announcement of a suspension of activities"".

""Ador is fully committed to supporting NewJeans, consistent with the terms of our legally valid exclusive contract,"" they added. ""We hope to meet with the artists as soon as possible to discuss the path forward.""

NewJeans are considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, and were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world in 2023.

""I had no self control,"" said Ioan, who is S4C's digital news editor.

""Food controlled everything I did and how I lived my life.

""At the time I didn't accept that I was addicted to food and was overeating but, looking back, I obviously was.""

He added: ""I could be here all day blaming this and that for the situation I was in, but it simply comes down to two things - I was too greedy and too lazy.

""When I look back, I feel embarrassed that I had chosen to live my life like that. It's only now that I realise what I'd done to myself and my body.""

In a period of seven years, with the help of bariatric operations to reduce his stomach and remove skin, he lost more than half his weight - 30 stones (191kg) - he was eligible for a transplant.

It was discovered that his mother was a match and could donate one of her kidneys to her son.

""I want Ioan to live his life, he deserves it,"" she said.

Ioan, now 35, now hopes for a healthier future.

""I've been through so much. I just want this to work without any problems,"" he said.

""It's natural to worry more about mam than myself because mam is putting herself in a vulnerable position to try to improve my life. It all depends on this now.""

First black Republican congresswoman Mia Love dies at 49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7xzzn3kd2o,BBC,Jaroslav Lukiv,24-03-25,"Mia Love, the first US black Republican congresswoman, has died aged 49 in Utah, her family has announced.

""She passed away peacefully"" on Sunday, surrounded by family at her home in the town of Saratoga Springs, a statement said.

Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, had represented the state of Utah in the House of Representatives.

Her daughter Abigale said earlier this month that Love had no longer been responding to treatment for brain cancer.

""In the midst of a celebration of her life and an avalanche of happy memories, Mia quietly slipped the bands of mortality and, as her words and vision always did, soared heavenward,"" said the family statement, which was posted on X.

Paying tributes to Love, Utah Governor Spencer Cox wrote: ""A true trailblazer and visionary leader, Mia inspired countless Utahns through her courage, grace, and unwavering belief in the American dream.

""Her legacy leaves a lasting, positive impact on our state. We will miss her deeply.""

Mia Love's political career formally started in 2003 when she won a seat on the Saratoga Springs' city council, and she later became the mayor, aged 34.

In 2014, she was elected to the US House of Representatives. She made history as the first black Republican woman to take up the role, and served two terms.

Love was critical of Donald Trump when he was running for president in 2016, endorsing instead his Republican nomination rival Texas Senator Ted Cruz, who dropped out of the race a few months later.

She also called for Trump to publicly apologise for makingderogatory comments about Haitiin 2018.

Her bid for a third term ended in a razor-thin defeat to her Democratic rival Ben McAdams.

Trump reacted to that by saying at a news conference: ""Mia Love gave me no love, and she lost.""

Before entering politics, the mother of three worked for some time as a flight attendant.

As a teenager she dreamed of an acting career, later graduating from the University of Hartford in Connecticut with a degree in musical theatre.

In 2022, Love was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a fast-moving and aggressive form of brain cancer, and was given just 10-15 months to live - which she surpassed.

Her death comes nearly two weeks after Love wrote anopinion piece for Deseret News, which she said was ""not to say goodbye but to say thank you and express my living wish for you and the America I know"".

The 48-year-old US comedian, who appeared on the prank show from 2011-21, responded after a woman alleged he sexually assaulted her in 2023, when she was 19.

In a statement to US media, Gatto said: ""I have used poor judgment and as a result have violated the trust of the people I love most. But anyone who knows me at all knows full well that I wouldn't assault anyone.""

He added: ""Working on myself is an ongoing process, and I am now going to take some time away from the public eye to focus my energies where I need to.""

The TikTok user claimed she had been abused by the star at a Milwaukee hotel in September 2023, after having been invited to see one of his stand-up shows  following a chance meeting.

""I got sexually assaulted by Joe Gatto, the Impractical Joker,"" she said in a video posted on Thursday, adding she had been talking about her experience ""for over a year"" and had not expected it to suddenly go viral.

She said she had been to see Gatto at his hotel after the gig. ""I don't want to go into the details about everything,"" she continued, but added she also did not ""want any girl to feel"" the way he made her feel.

She posted pictures of bruises on her bottom that the star allegedly caused with his teeth.

Gatto starred on Impractical Jokers - a hidden camera US comedy and reality show with improvisational elements - for nine seasons before leaving in 2021.

He said at the time he was stepping away ""due to some issues in my personal life"" amid his separation from his wife.

In September 2023, Gatto shared online that the couple had reconciled.

Ex-Bangladesh captain Tamim in hospital after cardiac arrest,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cy7xzrldgj1o,BBC,Ben Collins,24-03-25,"Tamim Iqbal played county cricket for Nottinghamshire and Essex

Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal is ""under close observation"" in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest during a domestic T20 game in Dhaka.

The 36-year-old opener, who represented Bangladesh 391 times between 2007 and 2023, was playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club on Monday.

Tamim, Bangladesh's record run-scorer in one-day internationals, complained of chest pains after taking to the field in their Dhaka Premier League fixture against Shinepukur.

Plans to transport him in a helicopter were abandoned as his condition deteriorated and he was instead taken for immediate treatment at a closer facility, the KPJ Specialized Hospital.

""Tamim Iqbal Khan suffered a cardiac arrest this morning at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP),"" read a statement by the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

Tamim received ""immediate emergency medical treatment"" and underwent a ""successful angiogram procedure to address a blockage in one of the arteries of his heart"".

""He is currently under close observation at the hospital's coronary care unit,"" the statement added.

Tamim became only the second Bangladeshi to play county cricket in England with Nottinghamshire in 2011, and also had a spell with Essex in 2017.

He is the only Bangladeshi batter to score centuries in all three international formats.

""We are very thankful to all the medics and specialists for their swift actions in this critical situation,"" said BCB president Faruque Ahmed.

""The outpouring of concern for Tamim reflects how much he is loved and appreciated by the nation.""

Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cqjd1p98l4jo,BBC,Mike Henson,24-03-25,"Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch

Tom Williams, kneeling on one knee, runs his hand over the blades of grass. His eyes are desperately scanning as his heartbeat rises further.

It is deep in the second half of the 2009 Heineken Cup quarter-final at the Stoop. Williams' team - Harlequins - are a point down.

It is the biggest match the 25-year-old has ever played in.

Harlequins are aiming to make the last four for the first time. Trying to stop them are a star-studded Leinster team featuring the likes of Brian O'Driscoll, Jamie Heaslip, Rob Kearney and Felipe Contepomi.

The stakes are sky-high and time is tight.

But Williams has a more pressing concern.

""I had taken the blood capsule out of my sock, put it in my mouth, and then tried to chew down on it,""he remembers on Sportâs Strangest Crimes: Bloodgate, a BBC Radio 5 Live podcast that delves deeper than ever into one of rugby's most infamous scandals.

""But it fell out on to the floor. I'm red-green colour-blind. I can't see the thing on the floor so I am searching around for it.

""It's just the ridiculousness of it.""

A few minutes later, everyone could see it.

LISTEN: Bloodgate - Sport's Strangest Crimes

Williams, having found the capsule and burst it between his teeth, was led off the pitch, with strangely scarlet blood streaming from his mouth, splattering on Quins' famous quartered shirt.

A blood injury meant Harlequins could bring their star fly-half Nick Evans, previously substituted, back on for a late drop-goal shot at glory.

Williams departed the pitch against Leinster accompanied by physio Steph Brennan, left, watched by the Sky Sports cameras

The convenience of Williams' injury raised eyebrows and suspicions.

""Who punched Tom Williams in the mouth, Tom Williams?"" said former Bath and England fly-half Stuart Barnes as he commentated on Sky Sports.

Further along in the press box, Brian Moore was working for BBC Radio.

""What a load of rubbish. That is gamesmanship at best, downright cheating at worst,"" he said on air.

Down on the touchline, Leinster's staff were making a similar point, if in stronger language.

""As it was playing out [Harlequins director of rugby] Dean Richards was on the sidelines and I had a few words with him,"" says Ronan O'Donnell, the Irish side's operations manager.

""I'd probably have to bleep a few of them out. I just told him he was cheating and he knew he was cheating.""

O'Donnell repeated his claim to one of the touchline officials.

""He showed me his fingers,"" remembers O'Donnell.

""He'd got some of the 'blood' on his fingers and it was like a Crayola marker had burst on his hands. It was that sort of texture and colour. He wasn't happy about it either.""

Williams headed down the tunnel, surrounded by Harlequins staff. Members of the Leinster backroom followed in hot pursuit.

The truth went with them. But it didn't take long to emerge.

Bloodgate: The scandal that rocked rugby union

Richards was asked about Williams' apparent injury immediately after the match.

""He came off with a cut in his mouth and you have a right, if someone has a cut, to bring them off,"" he said.

""So your conscience is clear on that one?"" persisted touchline reporter Graham Simmons.

""Yes, very much so,"" affirmed Richards.

The capsule was done, but the cover-up had begun.

Williams, by then, did have a cut in his mouth.

Locked in the home dressing room, while Leinster staff and match officials hammered on the door demanding entry and an explanation, he had pleaded with club doctor Wendy Chapman to use a scalpel to create a real injury in place of the fake one.

With the volume increasing outside, she reluctantly did so. A photo was taken as evidence to support Quins' conspiracy.

""We were trying to win and we thought nothing of it in terms of ethics,"" Williams tells Bloodgate.

""We thought we were just pushing the boundaries and doing what it took to try and get a result.""

They had failed to do so on the pitch. A limping Evans had shanked a late drop-goal and Leinster hung on to win.

Soon, they needed to do so in a boardroom.

Three months after the match, Williams, Chapman, Richards and Harlequins physio Steph Brennan were sat in the plush offices of a central London law firm.

All faced misconduct charges. And a big screen.

The screen played television pictures which had never originally been broadcast.

They showed Brennan appearing to pass something to Williams as he went on the pitch to treat another player. Williams then appeared to fold the mystery object into the top of his sock.

And then finally, a few minutes later, the wing, kneeled, retrieved it and, after dropping it on the floor, placed it back in his mouth.

Together with the footage of him walking off the pitch, winking to a team-mate en route, it made a compelling case.

Dean Richards was a legendary player, winning 48 England caps and representing the British and Irish Lions, before moving into coaching

The club had its defence though.

Richards had co-ordinated their accounts.

Williams, they all claimed, had been retrieving his mouthguard from his sock. His mouth was already bleeding. Chapman had applied gauze to Williams' mouth, not a scalpel.

Richards called the charges against him and his club ""ridiculous"", claiming that fair play was ""in-built"" to his coaching.

Brennan, who had bought the capsule used by Williams from a fancy dress shop in Clapham, claimed never to have seen them outside of a Halloween party.

The panel presiding over the case were suspicious, but, with Quins' backroom staff sticking rigidly to their story, they couldn't unpick the full connivance.

""It was just so obviously a lie,"" says Williams. ""I realised I was properly in trouble.""

When the verdict came, it landed wholly on Williams. He was banned from rugby for a year. Richards, Chapman and Brennan were all cleared, with the club handed a 250,000 euro fine for failing to control their player.

WIlliams was, in the eyes of the adjudicating panel, a lone rogue agent.

Harlequins, united in both the crime and cover-up, were suddenly divided by a punishment that touched only one of their number.

Ugo Monye, right, spent the whole of his 13-year professional career at Harlequins

Williams, having supposedly brought disgrace on Harlequins by independently concocting the blood capsule plan, sought advice from the Rugby Players' Association.

They urged him to appeal, to blow the whistle on the whole plot.

But the club had other ideas. Williams was offered a new two-year deal, three years of guaranteed employment at the club once he had retired and a promise to help him build a career outside of rugby.

He just had to hold back on the real story. He had to be a team-mate once more. He had to protect the club that meant so much to them all.

The full extent of the plot, the complicity of the club's medical staff and coaches, couldn't come out.

""They said to me 'do you understand the impact of this decision you're about to make? If you come forward and show this, Harlequins will be kicked out of Europe, your friends' playing opportunities for their countries will be reduced, Steph and Wendy will be struck off, we'll lose sponsors we'll lose money',"" Williams remembers.

""Playing rugby was all I wanted to do and all I felt that I could do.

""So I was stuck between coming forward and telling the truth and falling on my sword. And I didn't know what to do.""

""I'd have taken the rap,"" Ugo Monye, Williams' team-mate at the time, tells Bloodgate. ""With the deal that was supposedly being offered, 100%.""

The pressure was extreme.

Harlequins were desperate to contain a toxic scandal. Banned and branded a cheat, Williams wanted to tell the truth, explain his actions and rescue his rugby dreams.

At one point, he asked for more money in exchange for his silence; Â£390,000 to pay off his mortgage and a four-year contract. Quins refused.

In a statement from the time Quins chairman Charles Jillings described Williams' demands as ""exorbitant"" and ""shocking"". He insisted that ""under no circumstances was the financial proposal a reward for Tom's silence.""

""I'd sunk to rock bottom,"" says Williams. ""It was a catastrophic period from a personal standpoint.""

And all the time, the clock was ticking.

Williams had one month to appeal against his ban, to go public and get his career back on track.

Two days before the window to appeal shut, an email landed in Williams inbox.

He wasn't the only one considering an appeal. The European Cup organisers too were unhappy that he was the only person found guilty. They knew there must be more to the case.

The chances of one young player coming up with such a scheme on his own and carrying it out in secret in the tight and tightly-controlled environment of a professional club were remote.

They wrote to tell Williams they were to appeal against Richards, Brennan and Chapman being cleared. They would call him as a witness, cross-examine him and, if he didn't comply, level a second misconduct charge at him.

""His face literally just went white,"" remembers Alex, Williams' girlfriend at the time, now wife.

A final summit meeting with the Harlequins hierarchy was called.

Tom and Alex drove to the Surrey home of one of the club's board. Drinks and snacks were laid out, but the conversation soon turned to business.

""We were going round and round in circles,"" remembers Tom.

""Harlequins were saying to me, if I fell on my sword, for want of a better term, they would guarantee me future employment, pay off some of my mortgage, pay for me to go on sabbatical and we'll guarantee my girlfriend's future employment.

""On the other hand, if I came forward and told the truth they said l would bury the club.""

Frustrated, stressed and tired after three hours of back and forth, Alex excused herself for a cigarette break. As she stubbed it out and prepared to go back into the meeting, she saw Tom coming in the opposite direction.

He had given up. He would run away, leave the country, turn his back on rugby, start again - anything to get out of this situation.

Alex hadn't finished though. She wanted to ask one more question of the 13 men in the room.

She walked back in.

""I remember the surprise on their faces when it was just me standing there,"" she says.

""I said 'I'm really sorry to bother you again, but do you mind if I just have you for a couple more minutes? I just want to ask you all individually one question'.

""I went round and I actually pointed to every single person and I just said, 'Is this Tom's fault?' And each of them gave a resounding no. Every single one of them.""

""Alex humanised me again, because I had dehumanised myself, Harlequins had dehumanised me,"" says Tom.

""I was a pawn by that point, and I was ready to be moved in any way that anyone pushed me.

""She was the person from outside of this tight rugby centric-environment who could cut through that.

""She said what had gone on was not my fault - what had gone on was wrong - and made people realise that.""

Then-Leinster coach Michael Chieka, far right in black coat, was keen to make his point to match officials as Tom Williams headed for the dressing room

Early the next morning, Tom got a phone call.

Richards had resigned. Harlequins said they would support Williams telling the truth and accept the fall-out.

The game was up. The cover-up would be uncovered. The truth would change lives.

At a hearing in Glasgow, Williams told the full story.

Richards admitted instructing physio Brennan to carry the blood capsules in his medical bag ""just in case"". He was judged to be the ""directing mind"" of the Bloodgate plot and banned from rugby for three years.

Brennan admitted buying the fake blood in advance and was described as Richards' ""willing lieutenant"". He was banned from the sport for two years and a dream job working with England, all lined up, was gone.

Harlequins' club doctor Chapman was referred to the General Medical Council. By cutting open Tom's mouth, she had contravened a central principle of medicine to ""do no harm"".

She said she was ""ashamed"" and ""horrified"" by what she had done, but she had an unlikely supporter.

Arthur Tanner - the Leinster doctor that day at the Stoop, one of those incensed by Tom's fake injury - spoke up for her.

""When it transpired that she had been forced and coerced into doing it I really felt very, very sorry for her because I realised there was going to be a difficult two or three years ahead of her,"" he said.

Tom, who had pleaded with Chapman to cut his mouth, also supported her, telling the hearing she is ""as much a victim in all this as me"".

""It's a huge regret of mine... putting her in a position where she felt she had no other option but to do it,"" says Tom.

Chapman was cleared to return to medicine.

Of the quartet though, Williams was the only one to stay at Harlequins.

At the first game of the following season, some opposition fans turned up dressed as vampires.

He was targeted on the pitch, with opposing players aiming taunts, and sometimes punches, at him.

There was no sanctuary in the home dressing room either.

""A number of my team-mates would have been loyal to Dean Richards and felt that I'd betrayed not only him, but also them as a club,"" remembers Williams.

""It definitely impacted them, there was definitely a level of distrust, probably dislike as well.""

Williams became a quieter, sadder, slower presence. The zip was gone from his game, the smile was gone from his face.

It seemed he was just playing out his contract, an unwanted reminder of the past as Harlequins built an exciting new team under new boss Conor O'Shea during the 2011-12 season.

""I'd lost every morsel of confidence that I possibly could have had,"" remembers Williams.

""I wasn't in the team. I was just that person around training who had done something in the past.""

But, after a starring cameo in a win over French giants Toulouse, something reignited in Williams' game.

The season ended with Harlequins winning their first Premiership crown in the Twickenham sun, with Williams scoring the first try in front of Alex and their young son.

""It's curious how sport works, how life works out,"" says Williams.

""You go from dead and buried to feeling the elation of being on top of the world.""

Williams scored the opening try for Harlequins in the 2012 Premiership final

But you can also go in the opposite direction.

Williams played for Harlequins until 2015 when moved on to the coaching staff. In 2019, he left rugby to pursue a career in consultancy.

""About five years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I suspect that it came from this event,"" he says.

""I've been on medication ever since, and I struggle on a day-to-day basis.

""My initial impression is always to trust, and that got me in trouble in the first place - but it's how I operate best. I try and see the best in people.

""I try and see the best in everyone involved. And I wish them the best because there's no point holding on to it.

""Ultimately, it was a game of sport, but it did mean everything to me at the time.

""I wish I had the self-awareness and perspective I have now.

'McLaren the class of the field but have hard tightrope to walk',https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cddyvmz990eo,BBC,Andrew Benson,23-03-25,"Andrea Stella, centre, has been credited by many with McLaren's rise back to the top of the sport

Lando Norris says he and McLaren are ""ready"" to cope with the tension of an internal fight for the world championship between himself and team-mate Oscar Piastri.

The Australian made it two wins from two for McLaren this year with adominant victory in Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix, leading Norris over the line for the team's first one-two of the season.

Piastri's win moves him 10 points behind Norris in the championship following the Briton's impressive win in the season-opener inMelbourne last weekend, where Piastri finished ninth.

Norris said: ""We were free to race. We're both excited - probably nervous and excited at the same time - as I'm sure the team will be. But we're ready.""

Norris emphasised his and Piastri's determination to deal with the situation in a manner that is respectful both to each other and to McLaren's overall philosophy of letting the drivers race while putting the team's interests first.

""As much as we work together and we have a good time and enjoy ourselves, we both know we want to try and beat each other and show who's best. And that's inevitable,"" said Norris.

""So there's no point trying to hide away from that fact or make something of it.

""We're two competitors who both want to win. But we help each other out. I think we both achieved something better this weekend because of that fact. And we'll continue to do that.""

After a win and a pole for each of the McLaren drivers in 2025, the car is the class of the field at this early stage of the season.

McLaren are choosing to ignore the claim of Mercedes driver George Russell, who finished third in China, that they could win every race this season. Team principal Andrea Stella described that as ""just distractions that we don't take"".

For now, Piastri is in fourth place in the championship, with Russell and Red Bull's Max Verstappen in between him and his team-mate.

McLaren are aware of the possibility that the competition between Norris and Piastri is likely to become a title fight this season, whether or not other drivers remain involved.

McLaren's philosophy, in a nutshell, is one of fairness.

The drivers are allowed to race but they must not risk each other's cars or damage the team's interests.

McLaren believe that running a team this way encompasses one key advantage that overrides the potential downsides - the drivers benefit from each other's competitiveness. And they say this was on show in Shanghai.

Piastri said: ""We've got different strengths and weaknesses as drivers. This weekend there were certain points where it just worked a bit to my favour, naturally.

""There's been other weekends where it definitely hasn't, and I've had to try and look at things from how Lando's driven and apply them myself.""

In the case of China, Norris' issue was that the McLaren was suffering from understeer - a lack of front grip. It's a natural feature of the track, but one that for Norris was exacerbated by the McLaren car's individual behaviour.

No driver likes understeer. But, as Stella put it, it was ""more of a penalty for Lando, given his driving style and the way he wants to generate lap time"".

""I hate understeer,"" Norris said. ""I just can't drive a car with no front. I can, but I struggle. I cannot maximise the package that way.""

The reasons why this was more of a problem for Norris than Piastri are complex, and to do with the technical nuances of how individual F1 drivers manipulate their cars in different kinds of corners, and what they need from the car and tyres to do that - each one's ability differs slightly in these aspects.

Norris' desire for a strong front end, and the McLaren's reluctance to give it to him  in China led to him struggling to put his best lap together throughout the two qualifying sessions in Shanghai, one for the sprint and one for the grand prix.

He was fast, but there were too many mistakes, originating in this disconnect between his style and the behaviour and predictability of the car.

It's why he struggled comparatively in the sprint event, which Norris finished eighth, making little progress after dropping from sixth on the grid to ninth with an error on the first lap.

Stella said Norris learned how to adapt his driving and improve by studying what Piastri had been doing on his way to second place behind Lewis Hamilton.

He said: ""Having two drivers of this very high level, the information one can take from the other is valid information, is relevant and if you can do a good job of merging the strengths of both, then you elevate your game.""

Still, the understeer-based struggles in qualifying ultimately limited Norris' potential.

Norris passed Russell on the first lap from third on the grid to move up to second. But the advantage of free air Piastri had earned by turning his pole into the lead, and the strain following puts on tyres, meant Norris was always likely to have been fighting a losing battle, even before the brake problems in the last 15 laps that put paid to his hopes of making a late charge.

On such small, esoteric, technical differences are races decided - and in the case of the McLaren drivers this year, perhaps world titles. For where Norris struggled in China, Piastri will have occasions when some aspect or other prevents him from competing.

In 2024, significantly more often than not, the balance was in Norris' favour. But Piastri set himself the target over the winter of ironing out the inconsistencies in his performance and ensuring he could compete at every race, not just some of them.

Stella pointed out that his improvement from last year in China - where he was off Norris' pace and finished more than 40 seconds adrift - pointed to the success of that homework.

Both McLaren drivers have one win each this season

McLaren's approach to running their team is exactly what most fans of F1 would want - it is a sporting philosophy, based on a fundamental belief in the integrity of competition.

But it's a hard tightrope to walk, on track and off.

When two evenly matched drivers in equal cars are allowed to race, their employers have to trust they are going to behave and not risk the machinery. And even if they don't come to blows, the mere fact of racing can bring competitors into play - as happened to McLaren at theItalian Grand Prixlast year.

Stella believes that the drivers share the team's philosophy - and events so far have borne him out. But so far the stakes between them have been relatively small - a race win here and there. Now the sport's biggest prize looks to be at stake.

""When it comes to the internal competition, in reality, we have tried to be ready for that for a long time now,"" said Stella.

""Like all the things in F1, it would be very arrogant to say: 'Oh, now we are ready, or we were ready.'

""You learn. The scenarios are very complex. They never manifest themselves in the same way. So you just have to continue learning, and like you do on performance, on reliability, on operations, you also do in the way you manage a team.

""For me, what's important is that the fundamental values that everyone brings to support the interest of the team is healthy and is according to our principles.

""We are very lucky with Oscar and Lando because it comes natural and, so far, the fact that we have Oscar and Lando for me is just a way of elevating the performance of the team and the internal competition.

""I'm sure there will be situations, but I'm also sure that they will be reviewed, and we will learn, and we will grow even more the way in which we protect the interest of the team.""

As the competitive tension mounts in a championship, the stakes for the drivers increase. The lesson of F1 history is that it can often end in tears - think Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren, or Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso at McLaren, or Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes.

Whether this becomes a battle as tense as those remains to be seen. But it certainly has the potential to be as close.

A missed flight and an absent manager on the eve of a World Cup qualifier.

As Wales take on North Macedonia on Tuesday as part of a campaign they hope will result in a trip to north America next summer, they return to the city made memorable for the time Chris Coleman forgot to check his luggage.

It is 12 years since Skopje was the setting for one of the more bizarre tales of Welsh football history, one that drew sniggers and sneers, not to mention damning headlines for their under-pressure manager.

But while it will be long remembered as the time the Wales manager lost his passport â before losing the game â it was also the night the team found their voice.

And with it, discovered a path to qualification they still travel upon today.

Quiz: How well do you know Bellamy's career?

""Good to see you Kit, but with the greatest respect, where's the manager?""

It is September 2013 and Kit Symons had just taken his seat in front of the waiting media at the Tose Proeski Arena, the same venue Wales will play on Tuesday night.

The former Manchester City, Crystal Palace and Fulham defender had been part of the backroom staff since Coleman had accepted the unenviable task of replacing his close friend Gary Speed in the most trying of circumstances.

There was little more than 24 hours until Wales â including a soon-to-retire Craig Bellamy and Gareth Bale just weeks into his status as the world's most expensive player â were to face Macedonia at the tail-end of a failing campaign to reach the 2014 World Cup.

The inquisitor already knew the answer. As did most in the room.

""Skopje wasn't quite as developed as it is now, but it was a glorious day and we had walked along the river from the city to the stadium,"" recalls newspaper journalist Neil Moxley, who had covered Wales for several campaigns.

""As we walked, I can remember thinking what kind of questions we were going to ask Chris Coleman, who was a great guy to work with but hadn't had the easiest of rides.

""You had the Bale angle, but it was a bit of a dead-rubber of a game â and then the whispers had started. The manager had forgotten his passport and hadn't travelled.""

As the team â Bale, Aaron Ramsey, Ben Davies and all â began to train on the uninviting pitch on the other side of the wall, Football Association of Wales (FAW) officials were simply saying Coleman was delayed by ""passport issues"".

""That's all I was told I could say,"" laughs Symons now, having had the uncomfortable job of trying to show all was normal.

""It was going to be resolved and he'd be there in plenty of time for the game â but I knew I was going to get battered.""

Coleman had realised his ""passport issue"" the previous night, but Symons only knew the former Fulham and Crystal Palace defender's dash to the nearby Newport passport office for an emergency replacement was in vain when he was not boarding the chartered flight in the morning.

Instead, a convoluted alternative flight with stops via other European hubs awaited Coleman, as did the headlines.

For a football nation still smarting from some of the mockery of the years under Bobby Gould â with training ground wrestling and practice matches on prison grounds â the words embarrassing and farcical again found their way into the copy filed.

""We knew what was coming, but in reality all your work is done by that point,"" recalls Symons.

""The training the night before a game is by and large a stretch of the legs after travelling.

""You don't even go through set pieces or shape because you know some of the locals will be watching.

""It didn't really matter â but it didn't look good either.""

Not when Bale's presence alone - followed all week by Spanish photographers with his move to Madrid still fresh â put a global focus on matters.

And certainly not for a manager still trying to win over critics and supporters.

FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford had conceded defeat on trying to downplay things on the night, but later put it: ""We've all misplaced wallets or passports or whatever, it's just when you're in the position of national team manager you do it with a megaphone.""

And, even in the early days of social media, the unusual tale had long since found its way back home.

""Sometimes you write stories with a heavy heart because you like them as a person,"" adds Moxley.

""They try and say there's no new stories in football â but an international manager missing the night before a game because he'd lost his passport? This was definitely one.""

""Do I have anything to say? No, but you have obviously. You write it. We are building a good little team here, but you won't write about that.""

Chris Coleman was not so much defensive as on the attack as he faced up to questions over his blunder in the aftermath of a 2-1 defeat.

He had a point too; performances had been increasingly promising and there had been signs of a team and manager finding their feet together.

""That was the thing, we actually played well that night and deserved something from the game,"" recalls midfielder Joe Ledley.

""I remember the conditions being quite difficult; the pitch was really dry and bobbly, and they were really physical against us as a relatively young side.

""The manager not being there the night before didn't make any difference â we didn't even really notice until we were on the plane, and even then we had a bit of laugh about it.

""We lost and were gutted, but I remember feeling we still felt we were progressing and getting close to being where we wanted to be and taking the next step to achieving what we wanted.

""But it's Wales for you - nothing's ever straightforward.""

Chris Coleman is currently in charge of Belgian top flight side OH Leuven

A deflected free-kick had given the hosts the lead before Ramsey won and converted a penalty to equalise, only for Aleksandar Trajkovski to make the most of a late lapse of concentration.

Injuries had hit the squad too. Bale's only involvement in the game was to fend off a couple of local autograph hunters who rushed onto the pitch at half-time.

Not able to shake off a foot problem, he had been named on the bench by Coleman - but only to keep the opposition guessing, something that had confused supporters.

The result officially ended 2014 World Cup qualification hopes and â with a new contract still not agreed between the FAW and the manager â some wondered if it would be the end of his reign, well before the Euro 2016 success that was to come.

""We had been going along nicely, but I'd brought it upon myself and I was angry that I'd done that,"" said Coleman a few years later.

""I'd messed up but I just knew if they could stay with me, then we could be ready to take things on in the next campaign.""

Bellamy â who would call time on his Wales playing days the following month â spoke glowingly of Ramsey's potential, as the playmaker showed he was back to his best form since his horrific leg break a few years earlier.

But it was what players said in private to officials and the media in the hours afterwards that was most significant.

After the publication of the headlines which hit out at Coleman for the defeat and his passport gaffe, a number of senior players made their feelings known that â after some initial struggles together â they were fully on board with Coleman and his aims.

World Cup qualifying: Wales 3 - 1 Kazakhstan

Captain Ashley Williams was one of those who texted out his feelings to ""lay off the gaffer"", saying the players should not escape criticism but together they would get it right.

""We loved him [Coleman] and nights like that when he was under pressure, which we thought was unfair, made those bonds stronger,"" says Ledley, one of the players from that night who went on to reach the semi-finals of the Euros less than three years later.

""We knew we were onto something. It had been difficult for us and him after Gary, but we could see he was the right person.""

Coleman was unaware of the texts of support that made their way to journalists that night but officials picked up on the fact senior players were now clearly behind the manager. A new contract was offered and signed.

""He had such a strong relationship with the players,"" said Symons.

""He knew he messed up and what people would think on the outside but inside he had their trust and those messages showed they wanted to protect him.

""People talk about Together Stronger for Wales, and that was it there.

""And because we all know what happened after, you can smile at it â and probably helped.""

No laughing matter at the time, Coleman has since raised a smile at the events of Skopje that started with shambles but eventually led to a sense of where Wales were going under his charge.

""It didn't mean we didn't give him loads of stick about it,"" laughs Ledley.

Symons adds that every subsequent away fixture would see scores of smiling team officials ask Coleman to check he knew where his passport was.

And it does not diminish the tale's claim to be one of the more weird and wonderful in Welsh football.

""I've been privileged enough to cover some incredible moments and occasions following Wales,"" adds Moxley.

""But that trip to Skopje was the stand out story â especially when you know what happened next.""

Ex-Bangladesh captain Tamim in hospital after cardiac arrest,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cy7xzrldgj1o,BBC,Ben Collins,24-03-25,"Tamim Iqbal played county cricket for Nottinghamshire and Essex

Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal is ""under close observation"" in hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest during a domestic T20 game in Dhaka.

The 36-year-old opener, who represented Bangladesh 391 times between 2007 and 2023, was playing for Mohammedan Sporting Club on Monday.

Tamim, Bangladesh's record run-scorer in one-day internationals, complained of chest pains after taking to the field in their Dhaka Premier League fixture against Shinepukur.

Plans to transport him in a helicopter were abandoned as his condition deteriorated and he was instead taken for immediate treatment at a closer facility, the KPJ Specialized Hospital.

""Tamim Iqbal Khan suffered a cardiac arrest this morning at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP),"" read a statement by the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

Tamim received ""immediate emergency medical treatment"" and underwent a ""successful angiogram procedure to address a blockage in one of the arteries of his heart"".

""He is currently under close observation at the hospital's coronary care unit,"" the statement added.

Tamim became only the second Bangladeshi to play county cricket in England with Nottinghamshire in 2011, and also had a spell with Essex in 2017.

He is the only Bangladeshi batter to score centuries in all three international formats.

""We are very thankful to all the medics and specialists for their swift actions in this critical situation,"" said BCB president Faruque Ahmed.

""The outpouring of concern for Tamim reflects how much he is loved and appreciated by the nation.""

'Tinkering Hovland's pursuit of perfection pays dividends',https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cvg1y2qkr8no,BBC,Iain Carter,24-03-25,"Hovland's victory was his seventh on the PGA Tour

Famed sport psychologist Bob Rotella constantly reminds his clients that golf is not a pursuit anyone can perfect.

But it is a game that still attracts more than its share of perfectionists. Characters such as Viktor Hovland, who dragged himself from apparent golfing oblivion to become the latest winner on the PGA Tour.

This out of the blue success was an astonishing turnaround of form and fortune.

""It's like you keep drowning and you're running out of air,"" the 27-year-old Norwegian said of his recent travails after beating Justin Thomas in the Valspar Championship last Sunday to land yet another European victory on American soil this year.

Hovland's late surge secures Valspar Championship victory

England's Mansell wins maiden DP Tour title

England's Rhodes holds nerve to claim maiden LET victory

It is fair to say Hovland's success was among the least expected in a series of 2025 wins that will surely cheer European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald. This was the Oslo born star's first win since the 2023 Tour Championship.

Then he was ranked the fourth best player on the world, someone who possessed an unorthodox but highly effective swing and who had solved his problems around the green, seemingly the only aspect holding him back.

In short, he looked a complete player, one ready to start winning majors and capable of becoming a dominant figure. The finished article.

Yet, there is no such thing in this game. The pursuit for better never ends and capriciously it brings no guarantees of improvement.

There are those who say ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  Rory McIlroy used that very phrase talking about his own game in the wake of his recent play-off win at the Players Championship.

But Hovland most certainly does not fall into that category.

""I find it kind of weird that we're professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, 'oh he's a perfectionist, he's out on the perimeter searching too much',"" he commented.

""That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments. So if you're not going to try to get better, what are you doing?""

This from a player who had the world at his feet, only to then make a string of swing changes while emulating the Watford FC approach to hiring and firing coaches.

In the 574 days that followed his Tour Championship victory, Hovland slumped from first to 137th on the tour's FedEx Cup standings. He had missed the cut in his previous three outings, including starting the Players with a ruinous 80.

But the golfer believed the constant tinkering, the pursuit of perfection, to be entirely justified. ""It's not like I'm inventing stuff,"" he said.

But what he did realise was that he needed to go back to feels and methods that had previously worked. ""I have data that can show that what I used to do was objectively better than what I'm doing now.

""So why shouldn't I try to go back to what I used to do?""

He reconnected with former coach Grant Waite while still pondering whether it was worth heading to Tampa for the tournament he ultimately won. ""I was not very hopeful with my game leading into this week,"" Hovland admitted.

Between them they found an old feel on the range last Tuesday. It has been lost in pursuit for more speed and its rediscovery was a vital building block.

""He's really hard on himself,"" Hovland's caddie Shay Knight told PGATour.com. ""But as soon as he finds some little swing cue or thought, he tends to take it on board, and it happens really fast.

""And it just seemed to click; I knew something special was going to happen this week with the swing thought.""

Hovland was far from perfect and still fearful of losing long shots high and right, but he had a foundation to make him competitive. ""Incredibly, I did make it work and was able to win and I think that is something that I'm extremely proud of,"" he smiled.

The game remains ""more stressful than it should be"" but he feels reuniting with Waite, a former tour player, will lead to more success.

""He's definitely put his heart and soul into looking at all the different golf swings that I've sent him,"" Hovland said.

""It's challenging because I have a very unique pattern and it's unconventional and I would say most coaches probably would like to make my swing more conventional and hopefully try to fix the problem.

""But that's not really how my golf swing works. And I really trust Grant, because he he sees it and knows what kind of matchups need to be there for it to work.""

Hovland's win follows two PGA Tour victories for Northern Ireland's McIlroy already this year as well as big wins for Swede Ludvig Aberg, Austria's Sepp Straka and Belgium's Thomas Detry.

These results fuel optimism for a successful Ryder Cup defence for Europe at Bethpage in September. But do not get carried away.

Back in 2023 Americans Scottie Scheffler, Max Homa and Sam Burns were posting victories at this time of year, while Brooks Koepka, Wyndham Clark and Brian Harman landed majors. But the US team were soundly beaten in Rome.

There are no guarantees in the sport that Rotella, who has advised a string of major winners, insists is not ""a game of perfect"".  So it should not be a surprise that even Hovland's short-term hopes for next month's Masters are tempered.

""Some of the shots that I'm hitting, it's going to make it really difficult for me to be in contention at Augusta,"" he admitted.

""You're going to hit so many long irons into par-four holes and you've got to drive it pretty far because the fairways are pretty wide.

""It's more of a bomber's paradise versus this place (Copperhead in Tampa) where it's more just about being precise off the tee.

""So there's still some things that I need to improve, but luckily we've got two weeks and this is certainly nice to have in the back of my mind leading up to Augusta.""

'Pochettino's US compensation means imminent Spurs return unlikely',https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c70eddpe5xko,BBC,Sami Mokbel,24-03-25,"United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino was in charge at Tottenham between 2014 and 2019 and has also managed Paris St-Germain and Chelsea

United States head coach Mauricio Pochettino had sections of his former club's fanbase giddy with excitement last week after he declared his desire to one day return to Tottenham.

It isn't a new concept, Pochettino has previously been clear in his wish to become Spurs head coach for a second period - but the current conjecture over incumbent Ange Postecoglou's future has sharpened the issue.

The Argentine remains a hero among some of the regulars at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Joining in 2014, Pochettino led the team to second and third placed finishes in the Premier League and a Champions League final.

Photos of Pochettino sharing a coffee with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, that went viral on social media last week, served only to amplify affections among supporters who pine for his return.

The fact the photos are not recent, certainly not taken over the past 10 days, won't quell the fervour.

Pochettino is under pressure in his current job. With a home World Cup in 2026 just 15 months away, his US side have lost consecutive Concacaf Nations League matches in the past week - beaten by Panama and Canada.

Yet, dig deeper and you realise the prospect of the 53-year-old returning to Spurs any time soon is hugely unlikely.

The United States Soccer Federation would be owed what has been described by a well-placed source as ""one of the biggest financial compensation fees in football history"" if Pochettino was to leave for Spurs - or any other team for that matter - before the next World Cup.

Chelsea's Â£21m payment to Brighton to land Graham Potter after sacking Thomas Tuchel in 2022 and Bayern Munich's Â£21m to RB Leipzig to pave the way for Julian Nagelsmann's appointment in 2021 are, according to reports, ranked as the two largest managerial compensation packages in history.

Pochettino signed a two-year contract in September, with multiple reports stating he earns Â£4.6m a year.

However, it is understood the sum US Soccer would recoup if Pochettino leaves before next year's tournament, which they are hosting along with Canada and Mexico, extends way beyond the his salary and much closer to the amount Chelsea and Bayern, respectively, paid to land Potter and Nagelsmann.

Would Pochettino return progress Spurs?

Pochettino's recent remarks appeared to swing the door open towards him replacing Postecoglou should the Australian lose his job before next season.

""I am in the USA, so I am not going to talk about that now - but what I said then I still, after six years or five years, feel in my heart,""he said last week.""Yes, I would like one day to come back.""

However, according to well-placed sources, Pochettino has no immediate wish to return to Spurs. He is said to be fully committed to leading the US to a home World Cup.

Of course, the mammoth cost of releasing Pochettino from his current deal lends itself to a singular focus, with the notion of any club - particularly one with a chairman as financially astute as Daniel Levy - parting with such a sizeable sum as being far-fetched.

Yet, you get the sense Pocehttino's desire to lead the US to the World Cup is genuine and not a mindset borne out of stipulations relating to his contract.

Indeed, during the same interviews in which he re-affirmed his intention to one day return to Tottenham, the South American spoke of his engagement with his new team and the project ahead.

""For us, the pressure is going to be there [at the World Cup] because we are a host,"" he said.

""And then it's a country where the mentality is about winning. In sport, in everything that Americans are involved in, they want to win.

""The players know it's going to be massive pressure and now our president [Trump] likes to put pressure on, but it's welcome. That means we are going to feel the adrenaline we need to feel. We are ready to deliver.""

Tottenham Q&A: Does Postecoglou have a future at Spurs?

Much of the hype surrounding Pochettino's hypothetical return to Spurs stems from the fact Postecoglou is by no means certain of remaining in charge heading into next season.

Tottenham's disappointing season leaves him under scrutiny. They are in 14th place in the Premier League, having accumulated 34 points. Even if they win all their remaining nine matches, they would still fall short of last season's points total of 66.

Their wait for a domestic trophy will extend into next season after being eliminated from both cup competitions.

Postecoglou's only saving grace is Tottenham's run in the Europa League; they face Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals next month.

Of course, if Spurs win that competition the season takes on a very different complexion. Not only would success in Europe end the club's 17-year wait for silverware but it would also see them qualify for next season's Champions League.

Such a scenario would surely see Postecoglou strengthen his position.

That is easier said than done, of course. Indeed, failure to win the Europa League would raise further uncertainty over Postecoglou's job moving forward.

All current indications are that Tottenham want to get to the end of the season before reviewing the campaign and come to a decision.

Results, though, will likely dictate the club's approach.

Sunday's defeat by arch-rivals Canada has taken Pochettino's record as US head coach to five wins and three losses.

Prior to the current international break, Pochettino's win ratio since replacing Gregg Berhalter in September was healthier. But losing to Panama - 1-0 in the semi-final of the Concacaf Nations League - and 2-1 to Canada in the third-placed play-off, has led to some negativity.

Pochettino quickly moved to quell any disquiet after Sunday's defeat, saying: 'I've seen some times that teams that were building to play in the World Cup, they were not good until around the World Cup.

""I want to send a message to the fans, don't be pessimistic and don't get bad feelings.

""I think we have time because if we will be in this situation in one year time, for sure, I will tell you, 'Houston, we have a problem,' no?"" Pochettino said.

""In one year, if we're talking about that, it's because we have a big problem and we were not capable to discover, to try design a better strategy to provide to the team the capacity to play in a different way.

""I think we have time and I prefer that that happened today than [you] know, in one year.""

Nevertheless, with around 15 months until the World Cup starts, this month's results will have fans apprehensive.

Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/cqjd1p98l4jo,BBC,Mike Henson,24-03-25,"Blood brothers - bonds and betrayal on a rugby pitch

Tom Williams, kneeling on one knee, runs his hand over the blades of grass. His eyes are desperately scanning as his heartbeat rises further.

It is deep in the second half of the 2009 Heineken Cup quarter-final at the Stoop. Williams' team - Harlequins - are a point down.

It is the biggest match the 25-year-old has ever played in.

Harlequins are aiming to make the last four for the first time. Trying to stop them are a star-studded Leinster team featuring the likes of Brian O'Driscoll, Jamie Heaslip, Rob Kearney and Felipe Contepomi.

The stakes are sky-high and time is tight.

But Williams has a more pressing concern.

""I had taken the blood capsule out of my sock, put it in my mouth, and then tried to chew down on it,""he remembers on Sportâs Strangest Crimes: Bloodgate, a BBC Radio 5 Live podcast that delves deeper than ever into one of rugby's most infamous scandals.

""But it fell out on to the floor. I'm red-green colour-blind. I can't see the thing on the floor so I am searching around for it.

""It's just the ridiculousness of it.""

A few minutes later, everyone could see it.

LISTEN: Bloodgate - Sport's Strangest Crimes

Williams, having found the capsule and burst it between his teeth, was led off the pitch, with strangely scarlet blood streaming from his mouth, splattering on Quins' famous quartered shirt.

A blood injury meant Harlequins could bring their star fly-half Nick Evans, previously substituted, back on for a late drop-goal shot at glory.

Williams departed the pitch against Leinster accompanied by physio Steph Brennan, left, watched by the Sky Sports cameras

The convenience of Williams' injury raised eyebrows and suspicions.

""Who punched Tom Williams in the mouth, Tom Williams?"" said former Bath and England fly-half Stuart Barnes as he commentated on Sky Sports.

Further along in the press box, Brian Moore was working for BBC Radio.

""What a load of rubbish. That is gamesmanship at best, downright cheating at worst,"" he said on air.

Down on the touchline, Leinster's staff were making a similar point, if in stronger language.

""As it was playing out [Harlequins director of rugby] Dean Richards was on the sidelines and I had a few words with him,"" says Ronan O'Donnell, the Irish side's operations manager.

""I'd probably have to bleep a few of them out. I just told him he was cheating and he knew he was cheating.""

O'Donnell repeated his claim to one of the touchline officials.

""He showed me his fingers,"" remembers O'Donnell.

""He'd got some of the 'blood' on his fingers and it was like a Crayola marker had burst on his hands. It was that sort of texture and colour. He wasn't happy about it either.""

Williams headed down the tunnel, surrounded by Harlequins staff. Members of the Leinster backroom followed in hot pursuit.

The truth went with them. But it didn't take long to emerge.

Bloodgate: The scandal that rocked rugby union

Richards was asked about Williams' apparent injury immediately after the match.

""He came off with a cut in his mouth and you have a right, if someone has a cut, to bring them off,"" he said.

""So your conscience is clear on that one?"" persisted touchline reporter Graham Simmons.

""Yes, very much so,"" affirmed Richards.

The capsule was done, but the cover-up had begun.

Williams, by then, did have a cut in his mouth.

Locked in the home dressing room, while Leinster staff and match officials hammered on the door demanding entry and an explanation, he had pleaded with club doctor Wendy Chapman to use a scalpel to create a real injury in place of the fake one.

With the volume increasing outside, she reluctantly did so. A photo was taken as evidence to support Quins' conspiracy.

""We were trying to win and we thought nothing of it in terms of ethics,"" Williams tells Bloodgate.

""We thought we were just pushing the boundaries and doing what it took to try and get a result.""

They had failed to do so on the pitch. A limping Evans had shanked a late drop-goal and Leinster hung on to win.

Soon, they needed to do so in a boardroom.

Three months after the match, Williams, Chapman, Richards and Harlequins physio Steph Brennan were sat in the plush offices of a central London law firm.

All faced misconduct charges. And a big screen.

The screen played television pictures which had never originally been broadcast.

They showed Brennan appearing to pass something to Williams as he went on the pitch to treat another player. Williams then appeared to fold the mystery object into the top of his sock.

And then finally, a few minutes later, the wing, kneeled, retrieved it and, after dropping it on the floor, placed it back in his mouth.

Together with the footage of him walking off the pitch, winking to a team-mate en route, it made a compelling case.

Dean Richards was a legendary player, winning 48 England caps and representing the British and Irish Lions, before moving into coaching

The club had its defence though.

Richards had co-ordinated their accounts.

Williams, they all claimed, had been retrieving his mouthguard from his sock. His mouth was already bleeding. Chapman had applied gauze to Williams' mouth, not a scalpel.

Richards called the charges against him and his club ""ridiculous"", claiming that fair play was ""in-built"" to his coaching.

Brennan, who had bought the capsule used by Williams from a fancy dress shop in Clapham, claimed never to have seen them outside of a Halloween party.

The panel presiding over the case were suspicious, but, with Quins' backroom staff sticking rigidly to their story, they couldn't unpick the full connivance.

""It was just so obviously a lie,"" says Williams. ""I realised I was properly in trouble.""

When the verdict came, it landed wholly on Williams. He was banned from rugby for a year. Richards, Chapman and Brennan were all cleared, with the club handed a 250,000 euro fine for failing to control their player.

WIlliams was, in the eyes of the adjudicating panel, a lone rogue agent.

Harlequins, united in both the crime and cover-up, were suddenly divided by a punishment that touched only one of their number.

Ugo Monye, right, spent the whole of his 13-year professional career at Harlequins

Williams, having supposedly brought disgrace on Harlequins by independently concocting the blood capsule plan, sought advice from the Rugby Players' Association.

They urged him to appeal, to blow the whistle on the whole plot.

But the club had other ideas. Williams was offered a new two-year deal, three years of guaranteed employment at the club once he had retired and a promise to help him build a career outside of rugby.

He just had to hold back on the real story. He had to be a team-mate once more. He had to protect the club that meant so much to them all.

The full extent of the plot, the complicity of the club's medical staff and coaches, couldn't come out.

""They said to me 'do you understand the impact of this decision you're about to make? If you come forward and show this, Harlequins will be kicked out of Europe, your friends' playing opportunities for their countries will be reduced, Steph and Wendy will be struck off, we'll lose sponsors we'll lose money',"" Williams remembers.

""Playing rugby was all I wanted to do and all I felt that I could do.

""So I was stuck between coming forward and telling the truth and falling on my sword. And I didn't know what to do.""

""I'd have taken the rap,"" Ugo Monye, Williams' team-mate at the time, tells Bloodgate. ""With the deal that was supposedly being offered, 100%.""

The pressure was extreme.

Harlequins were desperate to contain a toxic scandal. Banned and branded a cheat, Williams wanted to tell the truth, explain his actions and rescue his rugby dreams.

At one point, he asked for more money in exchange for his silence; Â£390,000 to pay off his mortgage and a four-year contract. Quins refused.

In a statement from the time Quins chairman Charles Jillings described Williams' demands as ""exorbitant"" and ""shocking"". He insisted that ""under no circumstances was the financial proposal a reward for Tom's silence.""

""I'd sunk to rock bottom,"" says Williams. ""It was a catastrophic period from a personal standpoint.""

And all the time, the clock was ticking.

Williams had one month to appeal against his ban, to go public and get his career back on track.

Two days before the window to appeal shut, an email landed in Williams inbox.

He wasn't the only one considering an appeal. The European Cup organisers too were unhappy that he was the only person found guilty. They knew there must be more to the case.

The chances of one young player coming up with such a scheme on his own and carrying it out in secret in the tight and tightly-controlled environment of a professional club were remote.

They wrote to tell Williams they were to appeal against Richards, Brennan and Chapman being cleared. They would call him as a witness, cross-examine him and, if he didn't comply, level a second misconduct charge at him.

""His face literally just went white,"" remembers Alex, Williams' girlfriend at the time, now wife.

A final summit meeting with the Harlequins hierarchy was called.

Tom and Alex drove to the Surrey home of one of the club's board. Drinks and snacks were laid out, but the conversation soon turned to business.

""We were going round and round in circles,"" remembers Tom.

""Harlequins were saying to me, if I fell on my sword, for want of a better term, they would guarantee me future employment, pay off some of my mortgage, pay for me to go on sabbatical and we'll guarantee my girlfriend's future employment.

""On the other hand, if I came forward and told the truth they said l would bury the club.""

Frustrated, stressed and tired after three hours of back and forth, Alex excused herself for a cigarette break. As she stubbed it out and prepared to go back into the meeting, she saw Tom coming in the opposite direction.

He had given up. He would run away, leave the country, turn his back on rugby, start again - anything to get out of this situation.

Alex hadn't finished though. She wanted to ask one more question of the 13 men in the room.

She walked back in.

""I remember the surprise on their faces when it was just me standing there,"" she says.

""I said 'I'm really sorry to bother you again, but do you mind if I just have you for a couple more minutes? I just want to ask you all individually one question'.

""I went round and I actually pointed to every single person and I just said, 'Is this Tom's fault?' And each of them gave a resounding no. Every single one of them.""

""Alex humanised me again, because I had dehumanised myself, Harlequins had dehumanised me,"" says Tom.

""I was a pawn by that point, and I was ready to be moved in any way that anyone pushed me.

""She was the person from outside of this tight rugby centric-environment who could cut through that.

""She said what had gone on was not my fault - what had gone on was wrong - and made people realise that.""

Then-Leinster coach Michael Chieka, far right in black coat, was keen to make his point to match officials as Tom Williams headed for the dressing room

Early the next morning, Tom got a phone call.

Richards had resigned. Harlequins said they would support Williams telling the truth and accept the fall-out.

The game was up. The cover-up would be uncovered. The truth would change lives.

At a hearing in Glasgow, Williams told the full story.

Richards admitted instructing physio Brennan to carry the blood capsules in his medical bag ""just in case"". He was judged to be the ""directing mind"" of the Bloodgate plot and banned from rugby for three years.

Brennan admitted buying the fake blood in advance and was described as Richards' ""willing lieutenant"". He was banned from the sport for two years and a dream job working with England, all lined up, was gone.

Harlequins' club doctor Chapman was referred to the General Medical Council. By cutting open Tom's mouth, she had contravened a central principle of medicine to ""do no harm"".

She said she was ""ashamed"" and ""horrified"" by what she had done, but she had an unlikely supporter.

Arthur Tanner - the Leinster doctor that day at the Stoop, one of those incensed by Tom's fake injury - spoke up for her.

""When it transpired that she had been forced and coerced into doing it I really felt very, very sorry for her because I realised there was going to be a difficult two or three years ahead of her,"" he said.

Tom, who had pleaded with Chapman to cut his mouth, also supported her, telling the hearing she is ""as much a victim in all this as me"".

""It's a huge regret of mine... putting her in a position where she felt she had no other option but to do it,"" says Tom.

Chapman was cleared to return to medicine.

Of the quartet though, Williams was the only one to stay at Harlequins.

At the first game of the following season, some opposition fans turned up dressed as vampires.

He was targeted on the pitch, with opposing players aiming taunts, and sometimes punches, at him.

There was no sanctuary in the home dressing room either.

""A number of my team-mates would have been loyal to Dean Richards and felt that I'd betrayed not only him, but also them as a club,"" remembers Williams.

""It definitely impacted them, there was definitely a level of distrust, probably dislike as well.""

Williams became a quieter, sadder, slower presence. The zip was gone from his game, the smile was gone from his face.

It seemed he was just playing out his contract, an unwanted reminder of the past as Harlequins built an exciting new team under new boss Conor O'Shea during the 2011-12 season.

""I'd lost every morsel of confidence that I possibly could have had,"" remembers Williams.

""I wasn't in the team. I was just that person around training who had done something in the past.""

But, after a starring cameo in a win over French giants Toulouse, something reignited in Williams' game.

The season ended with Harlequins winning their first Premiership crown in the Twickenham sun, with Williams scoring the first try in front of Alex and their young son.

""It's curious how sport works, how life works out,"" says Williams.

""You go from dead and buried to feeling the elation of being on top of the world.""

But you can also go in the opposite direction.

Williams played for Harlequins until 2015 when moved on to the coaching staff. In 2019, he left rugby to pursue a career in consultancy.

""About five years ago, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I suspect that it came from this event,"" he says.

""I've been on medication ever since, and I struggle on a day-to-day basis.

""My initial impression is always to trust, and that got me in trouble in the first place - but it's how I operate best. I try and see the best in people.

""I try and see the best in everyone involved. And I wish them the best because there's no point holding on to it.

""Ultimately, it was a game of sport, but it did mean everything to me at the time.

""I wish I had the self-awareness and perspective I have now.

""I am very, very happy now. I've got three children who are healthy and happy, and I feel like I'm building a life for myself that isn't identified by a moment in time in 2009.""

Escaping the taint of what spilled from the capsule and cut that day has been hard for all involved.
