Then, in a breathtaking twist, Stone says she visited her daughters—one at school 200 miles away—before encountering a higher version of herself in a realm beyond. There, she found undeniable proof: God is real, and the afterlife awaits.

After coming back to life, Stone said the near death experience compelled her to totally change who she was as a person – finishing school, getting a PhD, and starting a podcast.

‘That’s what my life has been, all about serving, service to others, and service to myself and being a better mother,’Stone said.

As for her out-of-body experience, Stone now believes that God is‘definitely not a person, and time is definitely not linear. Everything is happening now.’

Daily Mailreport: Before this life-changing moment, Dr. Stone said she had‘strange experiences’as a child which scared her towards a scientific career, a‘hardcore black-and-white’view of life before her near-death experience (NDE).

She had never entertained the idea of a spiritual side to life, and Dr. Stone said she came from a very bad childhood background, where her therapist said,‘I can’t believe you are still alive.’

At the time of her brief‘death’in 2016, she described herself as‘pretty much a loser.’

She carried her trauma around like a‘badge of honor’and was drinking heavily and doing drugs.

‘I was married to somebody that I barely knew, and it was a nightmare, and I just wasn’t doing well,’Stone said.

‘I couldn’t keep a career on track. It was all just falling apart and I was really bitter and angry and very selfish, self centered, all about me and my problems.’

Stone was diagnosed with multiple conditions including bipolar disorder, and given different medications – none of which helped her.

But one day she had her monthly menstrual cycle‘and it just didn’t stop.’

‘I kind of made a joke and I said, ‘I think I’m bleeding to death,’ And that’s the last thing I remember saying before I woke up in an ambulance,’Stone recalled.

‘The next thing I’m in a hospital bed. I had this feeling come over me that I can only describe, is that I knew I was dying.’

She added that the feeling during this episode was like taking every hallucinogenic drug all at once.

‘It felt like I was going to explode. It’s too much. I couldn’t handle it. Then suddenly I popped out of my body,’Stone explained.

Stone described looking down to see her own body in the hospital bed and started to hear her heartbeat fade on the machine.

She watched as medical staff tried to revive her, before giving up on resuscitating her – allegedly due to her drug-related past.

Stone noted that, for a moment, she didn’t care as she left her body – until she thought about her children.

The instant she thought about her eldest child, Ashley, Stone said she was transported to her classroom, 210 miles away at Fresno City College.

The mother watched her daughter taking an exam and she added she could see what she was wearing that day.

Stone then realized that her death would have made Ashley an orphan, since her husband died of cancer in 2006.

She then thought about her second child, who was two years-old at the time, and was instantly transported back to the hospital waiting room where the little girl was playing with Lego blocks.

Stone said that she then returned to the hospital room as a technician was doing chest compressions.

That’s when she heard the the doctor say,‘Let’s call it.’

The technician replied,‘What, already? She is only 38,’leading the doctor to say,‘She’s a former junkie, just call it.’

‘I remember thinking, ‘Was that necessary?’Stone said.

Before returning to her body, Stone said she traveled to a white realm, where it was incredibly bright, and that’s where her final realization took place.

She could see with 360-degree vision, and it dawned on her that she no longer had a body – becoming an immense form that filled space itself.

‘I could have wrapped my arms around the entire planet if I wanted to,’Stone explained.

Stone then saw another person approaching – a different version of herself that was prettier and less wrinkled – and she knew instantaneously that she was‘going back.’

The mother said she saw a tunnel and re-entered her body through her belly button, which she noted‘hurt like absolute hell.’

This entire episode took place in the span of six minutes – and she remembered every detail of it.

In fact, after being revived, she asked the doctor,‘Did you call me a junkie?’The doctor confirmed that he did indeed make that comment.

Next, Stone spoke to her older daughter and found out that she had been taking an exam and was wearing the exact same clothes her mother saw in her NDE.

The experience changed her life. Stone felt that she had been on a‘trail to absolute destruction’before the event, but she suddenly‘found her purpose.’

She went back to school, finished her undergrad, Masters, then her PhD, and has since launched her ownpodcast.

‘I’ve been helping other people with trauma backgrounds, I can help other people. I had previously been an alcoholic, I would get home and drink 12 beers: now I can’t touch alcohol at all.’

Stone added that she no longer suffers from anxiety and doesn’t have to take medication anymore.

After her experience, she believes that what truly matters is being a good person and realizing that there is more to life than the black-and-white nature of her career in the sciences – including an afterlife.

Special Counsel Rita Peters, spearheading the prosecution, said that many of these young victims are already known to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, amplifying the urgency to dismantle this evil operation.

The suspects have been charged with multiple felony counts, including RICO, money laundering and purchase of child pornography.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) Commissioner Mark Glass appeared with AG Uthmeier at the press conference, saying,“Many of these individuals were babies. There is not a word in the English dictionary that can describe the gross content that was on the videos. The faces you see there are faces of evil.”

Uthmeier pointed out the Chinese social media app TikTok was allegedly used by the monstrous criminals to purchase the images and videos, saying it’s crucial that the company“be more accountable.”

According to authorities, the leader of the international pedophile ring is a man living in Turkey named Mehmet Bozuyuk.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is working with Homeland Security Investigations to extradite Bozuyuk to the United States to face justice for the crimes committed against American children.

“You’ve got my word that in this state, we are going to do everything we can to hold these people accountable,”Uthmeier said.“If you are a child predator… I hope you never see the sun again.”

Russia has repeatedly said it would not attack a NATO country.

RTreports: A raft of calls for“civic readiness”have been made by Western European governments since US president Donald Trump took office and the beginning of US-brokered Ukraine peace talks, described by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock as“deadlocked.”.

“Given the recent developments in the security situation, a greater focus should be placed on civil defense, including in school education,”an interior ministry spokesperson told Handelsblatt.

According to the outlet, a Russian attack on NATO territory“in four to seven years”is considered“a realistic scenario”by German military, the Bundeswehr.

Schoolchildren should be“prepared for the worst,”crisis response training should be introduced into school curricula, and emergency supplies should be stored in every home,the German ministry spokesperson reportedly proposed.

Moscow has repeatedly rubbished the claim it could attack a NATO country, since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict three years ago. However such“civic readiness’ calls have been made across the EU and in the UK in the last week.

The European Commission has recently recommended that EU citizens stockpile essential supplies, including food and water, to sustain themselves for at least three days in case of emergencies.

Poland and Norway have reinstated Cold-War-era measures such as bomb shelters and bunkers and mass military training. Sweden and Finland already have guides available to citizens on how to respond if they come under attack.

On Monday, the Kremlin said Russia was open to discussing a full ceasefire to end the Ukraine conflict, as long as there are guarantees that Kiev will abide by it.

Fauci Warns Next Pandemic May Be A Respiratory Infection That Causes Many Deaths,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/fauci-warns-next-pandemic-may-be-a-respiratory-infection-that-causes-many-deaths/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 7, 2025","Dr Anthony Fauci has declared that the ‘next global outbreak will likely be an easily transmissible respiratory disease, with a significant degree of morbidity’.

The formerNational Institutes of Infectious Disease director made the prediction during a discussion last week at the New Orleans Book Festival at Tulane University. He also said he’s very concerned now that bird flu has infected mammals.

He said: “What is likely to happen, I don’t know if it’s going to be next year or 10 years or 15 or 20 years from now, is the emergence of another respiratory disease”.

🚨 NEW – Anthony Fauci says ""the next outbreak will be of a respiratory disease that's easily transmissible, that has a significant degree of morbidity""pic.twitter.com/psUrIGwB45

InfoWarsreports: He continued: “It may be another coronavirus, because we know that coronavirus is really, mostly in bats, have the capability of binding to receptors that are in humans.”

Fauci added, “It could be another flu, we’re dealing with H5N1 now, which is bird flu, which has taken the somewhat disturbing step of infecting mammals, namely cows and cats and other mammals, which means it’s adapting itself more to a human.”

“My concern.. is that whenever that happens,the next outbreak will be of a respiratory disease that’s easily transmissible that has a significant degree of morbidity.”

Fauci went on to agree with the moderator that cuts made by the Trump admin to science programs could make everything “a little bit more dangerous.”

Fauci’s critical comments of Trump echo those of eugenicist Bill Gates, who claimed last week the world could see “literally millions of deaths” due to cuts made by Donald Trump and DOGE to government health agencies and non-governmental organizations like his GAVI global vaccine program.

Elsewhere in the discussion, Fauci claimed Covid measures like lockdowns, social distancing, and face masks worked.

Though COVID woke many up to the lies of the establishment and Big Pharma, Fauci is undeterred and has continued his fearmongering despite being booted from his official roles.

"Embalmers Uncover Fibrous, Rubbery Clots in 27% of mRNA-Vaccinated Corpses Over Past Year",https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/embalmers-uncover-rubbery-clots-in-27-of-mrna-vaccinated-corpses-worldwide-over-past-year/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"April 7, 2025","Embalmers worldwide are raising alarms in 2024 as 27% of corpses—many tied to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines—reveal strange, white, rubbery clots clogging arteries and veins, a troubling trend experts can’t ignore.



Disturbingly, laboratoryanalysesof the clots have revealed the presence of amyloid proteins, with a subset exhibiting prion-like seeding activity. Such proteins are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), raising fears that these conditions could emerge earlier in life among affected individuals.

Further testing identifiedabnormally high phosphorus levels—measuring 5,000 parts per million (ppm) compared to the typical 100–1,000 ppm found in normal blood. Researchers suggest this spike may stem from phospholipid nanoparticles in mRNA vaccines, which could trigger the misfolding of fibrinogen, a blood-clotting protein, into durable structures resistant to the body’s natural breakdown processes.

The findings have sparked concern beyond the embalming table. Critics argue that physicians are discarding these clots without investigation, while blood banks may unknowingly distribute supplies contaminated with prion-like proteins.

Despite repeated alerts from embalmers and independent researchers, public health authorities have yet to issue an official response or launch a formal inquiry.

The clots’ emergence aligns with the widespread rollout of mRNA vaccines, a connection that has fueled debate. According to data compiled by embalmers, these fibrous formations were virtually unseen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent vaccination campaigns.

Three separate ICP-MS analyses confirmed elevated levels of phosphorus, sulfur, and traces of tin in the clots, with phosphorus concentrations standing out as a potential driver of their formation.

Public health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), maintain that vaccines are rigorously tested and overwhelmingly safe, often citing efficacy rates around 95%. However, the lack of specific studies addressing the long-term effects of mRNA-derived nanoparticles has left gaps in the safety narrative, intensifying urgent calls for transparency.

As evidence mounts, the phenomenon of these mysterious clots continues to challenge the medical community and regulators alike. For now, embalmers remain on the front lines, documenting a trend that shows no signs of abating—and demanding answers that have yet to come.

TheMail Onlinereports: The ex-spy suggested a new type of enrolment would stop short of full military service for all. ‘In extremis, I think we’d be looking at something like the model I understand exists in places like Sweden, where the government theoretically has the power to compel people to give their service one way or another, but doesn’t exercise it except in areas where it’s really needed,’ he told the BBC’s Today Podcast.

Sir Alex said he was not proposing ‘blanket conscription’ but that he was interested in ‘ways in which the broader country would participate and contribute to security in a time of an emergency’. Sweden reintroduced a form of conscription for over-18s in 2017 in response to Russia ‘s invasion of Crimea.

In a separate development, families have been warned to pack a 72-hour ‘survival kit’ in case Russian attacks on energy pipelines plunge Britain into a blackout.

Households should be ‘ready for all eventualities’, security sources told The Mail on Sunday, to prepare for possible sabotage of the UK’s infrastructure by Vladimir Putin.

One source said: ‘We need to become much more self-sufficient, and quickly. And households should be ready for all eventualities.’

Russia meanwhile has repeatedly denied speculation it has plans to damage Western energy infrastructure.

RTreports: According to the British tabloid, the UK’s energy system has faced challenges and came close to blackouts during the past winter, relying on emergency reserves and electricity imports from Denmark to maintain supply. The situation has also been complicated by the British government’s push to phase out fossil fuel and nuclear power plants in favor of renewable energy.

Meanwhile, the Daily Mail pointed out that this could leave the UK vulnerable to potential sabotage of the energy infrastructure that connects Britain to the outside world, particularly by Russian ships.

In light of this, security experts told the paper that British households should also follow the EU’s advice of assembling a three-day survival kit. This kit should include water, non-perishable food, medicines, a battery-powered radio, a flashlight, identity documents, and a Swiss Army knife.

“We know that the Russians are active in the North Sea and have the power to cripple our energy links. We need to become much more self-sufficient, and quickly. And households should be ready for all eventualities,”the source said.

While the paper claimed that the fears about potential Russian sabotage also hinge on the fact it“was linked to a string of apparent sabotage incidents in the Baltic Sea”in recent months, Western investigators have failed to find any proof of any Russian connection to the incidents. Moscow has also vehemently denied speculation about its potential involvement, calling it“absurd.”

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer intends to“reignite [] industrial heartlands”through carbon capture, storage, wind farms and defense spending, a government source told Daily Mail.

Still, the paper’s source also noted that the government currently has no plans to encourage households to pack survival kits.

"Study Proves That Over 55,000 Were Killed With Midazolam in 2020",https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/study-proves-that-over-55000-were-killed-with-midazolam-in-2020/,The People's Voice,Jacqui Deevoy,"April 6, 2025","When a Substack article popped up on my phone at the end of February, I recognised the content immediately as the study the article was based on had been brought to my attention a year previously.



The 2024 study was explosive news to me at the time as it provided good evidence that the benzodiazepine sedative midazolam was undeniably linked to excess deaths in the UK at the start of the covid ‘pandemic’.

BYPASS THE CENSORSSign up to get unfiltered news delivered straight to your inbox.

As a journalist who’s been investigating this very issue for almost five years, I was naturally interested. The article, which appeared on Substack written by theFreedom Podcast, was saying that 55,000 people had died due to midazolam use in 2020. I’d worked with medical researchers back in 2020/2021 who’d calculated the figure to be 40,000 at the very least so seeing 55,000 didn’t surprise me in the slightest. From 2020 to the present day, I’ve spent hundreds of hours talking to people whose loved ones had their deaths hastened via NICE guideline NG163. In 2024, a study emerged that appeared to back up their claims.

Authored by Dr. Wilson Sy, this study found a strong correlation between midazolam use and excess deaths in 2020 and suggested it was highly likely that the UK’s excess deaths were tied to midazolam use and NOT to a virus.

Titled “Excess Deaths in the United Kingdom: Midazolam and Euthanasia in the COVID-19 Pandemic,” it examines UK data during the ‘pandemic’. It argues that excess deaths, especially in April 2020, were not mainly due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus but linked to excessive midazolam use and suggests possible systemic involuntary euthanasia within the NHS.

The evidence leans towards a high correlation (over 90%) between midazolam use and excess deaths across England in 2020. This correlation persisted post-vaccination in 2021, with no significant link to covid jabs, raising questions about the role midazolam played in these deaths.

Dr. Sy points out that, unlike Australia, where excess deaths were more tied to covid ‘vaccinations’, the UK’s excess deaths situation seems more linked to midazolam.

The official story is that, in 2020, the UK recorded approximately 705,636 total deaths, with around 74,917 attributed to covid. This is based onofficial statistics. Excess deaths, estimated at 50,000 to 60,000 above historical averages, were largely – according to the mainstream narrative – linked to the pandemic’s impact. Sy’s study tells a different story.

Midazolam is most commonly used for sedation in intensive care units (ICUs), for severe epilepsy and in palliative (end of life) care to manage extreme agitation or restlessness. In April 2020, then health secretary Matt Hancock ordered a huge supply of the drug from a factory in France. Around the same time, NICE guideline NG163 (a protocol intended for use as a treatment for covid and which was slammed by a panel of doctors and professors) was introduced and implemented. Shortly after this, the huge spike in care home and hospital deaths occurred.

From where I was standing, in the midst of distraught families whose loved ones had died suddenly and unexpectedly, it was clear that something sinister was happening. Families had discovered their relatives – most in care homes or hospitals – had been given deathly cocktails of midazolam and morphine and had died as a result. These victims weren’t terminally ill, weren’t suffering from a killer virus and many were not elderly. I decided to investigate. The result of those initial investigations was my first film ‘A Good Death?’ produced with Ickonic and premiered in December 2020.

But back to Dr. Wilson Sy’s study… The doctor, Director of Investment Analytics Research in Australia, conducted this study to analyze macro-data from the United Kingdom, focusing on excess deaths in 2020 and their potential causes. Published on February 15, 2024, and accessible viaResearchGate, the study involved the analysis of all-cause and excess mortality, sourced from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). During this analysis, Sy identified significant anomalies and inconsistencies with existing explanations attributing deaths to COVID-19. The study posits that the widespread and persistent use of midazolam suggests a possible policy of systemic involuntary euthanasia.

This finding incontrovertibly shifts the narrative from viral impact to medical intervention, challenging official accounts that attribute deaths to the virus itself. The study also notes uniform and simultaneous spikes in excess deaths across regions, inconsistent with natural contagion patterns, further supporting its involuntary euthanasia hypothesis.

These claims have been met with controversy, with official bodies like the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care denying any policy of involuntary euthanasia. Fact-checking organizations, such asFull Fact, argue there is no evidence of midazolam being used to kill patients, attributing increased prescriptions to the natural demand during a severe pandemic phase for palliative care. They note that midazolam’s use increased by over 100% in April 2020, but state that this was expected given the crisis. They also confirm that euthanasia – voluntary or involuntary/non-voluntary remains illegal in the UK. Despite the inevitable criticisms of the study, I can confirm that Sy’s findings tied in precisely with my own ‘on the ground’ research.

In summary, the study’s data showed:

– Excess deaths spread uniformly and simultaneously across all English regions, inconsistent with natural contagion.

– NHS and Nightingale hospitals were mostly empty,confirmingthe absence of a pandemic.

– The UK Government, Amnesty International, and the Care Quality Commission acknowledged systemic dysfunctions, including widespread use of “Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation” (DNACPR) notices, which also contributed to excess deaths.

Public and media reactions, as seen in articles likeThe Remnant Newspaper, have amplified the study’s claims, suggesting thousands of elderly were involuntarily euthanised to inflate covid death statistics.

In conclusion, Dr. Sy’s study presents a provocative analysis, suggesting midazolam use was indeed a major factor in UK excess deaths during the pandemic, potentially indicating the systemic involuntary euthanasia of up to 60,000 individuals.

I’ve spoken to nowhere near that number of families but shocked and bereaved relatives still approach me daily, each with a heartbreakingly horrific story to tell. From my own investigations, it would appear that the involuntary euthanasia was definitely being carried out in 2020 and Dr. Sy’s study now supports that.

Discernreport.comreports: Most job cuts will center around the IRS Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, which protects taxpayers from discrimination, audits, and investigations.

White House spokesperson Liz Huston told Fox News, “In a stark contrast to the previous administration’s wildly unpopular plan to hire thousands of additional IRS agents, President Trump is focused on saving tax dollars, eliminating bloat, axing useless DEI offices, and increasing the agency’s efficiency.”

Here’s more from Fox:

In addition to the layoffs, the agency said in a letter to employees that it is eliminating its Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, which is responsible for protecting taxpayers from discrimination, audits and investigations.

. . .

“This action is being taken to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the IRS in accordance with agency priorities and the Workforce Optimization Initiative outlined in a recent Executive Order,” the letter states, referring to President Donald Trump’s executive order directing the Department of Government Efficiency to get rid of wasteful spending.

The agency said it was approved to offer Voluntary Early Retirement Authority (VERA) and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment (VSIP). Information about those programs will be shared with employees at a later date, the message said.

“This calendar year to date, approximately 5% of this office left through the Deferred Resignation Program and attrition,” the message said. “An additional 75% of the office will be reduced through a RIF (Reduction in Force).”

A Treasury Department spokesperson told Fox News, “The rollback of wasteful Biden-era hiring surges and consolidation of critical support functions are vital to improving both efficiency and quality of service. ” The spokesperson added, “The Secretary is committed to ensuring that efficiency is realized while providing the collections, privacy, and customer service the American people deserve.”

Last week, the latest Challenger tracking data showed that DOGE-related layoffs havetopped 280,253 across 27 agencies.

Scientists Confirm a 99.9% Likelihood That Humans Are Already Living in the Matrix,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/scientists-confirm-a-99-9-likelihood-that-humans-are-already-living-in-the-matrix/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 6, 2025","Scientists have dropped a bombshell, asserting with 99.9% certainty that humans are already living in a Matrix-like simulation. This isn’t just sci-fi fantasy—experts argue that our reality, Earth, and the entire universe might be a colossal holographic projection, echoing the iconic film’s premise.



This mind-bending theory could unravel some of physics’ toughest mysteries, from the fate of someone tumbling into a black hole to the universe’s state post-Big Bang. Professor Marika Taylor, a theoretical physicist at the University of Birmingham, supports this by suggesting the universe is fundamentally two-dimensional, challenging everything we think we know about existence.

Dailymail.co.ukreports:  However, just like when you watch a 3D movie on a flat screen, the images on that 2D surface appear to have depth because of how they are projected onto it.

So, while you might see the world around you as a complex three-dimensional structure, Professor Taylor claims this is only an illusion.

That doesn’t mean our lives or the universe are any less real, but it does mean that the cosmos might be a lot stranger than we had previously thought.

When you think of the universe being a hologram, you might imagine the projected images from Star Wars or ABBA Voyage.

Although this is the right basic idea, it’s not quite the same type of hologram that physicists are thinking of.

The idea that the universe is a hologram doesn’t have anything to do with light or projectors as the name might suggest.

In scientific language, a hologram is a two-dimensional surface which appears to have a third dimension – like the holographic images on some credit cards.

Since holograms appear three-dimensional you can move around them and see different parts of the image as if there were a real object there.

However, if you reached out to touch one your hand would find only a flat surface.

Scientists like Professor Taylor argue that the whole universe is just like this – a two-dimensional surface that just looks like it has three dimensions.

Instead of the universe being like a solid block, Professor Taylor says we should think of it as more like a hollow ball.

Our solar systems and galaxies are contained inside the ‘3D’ space inside the ball, but the actual surface structure of the universe only has two dimensions.

According to the ‘holographic principle’, we can describe the gravitational movements of the planets and stars within the ball just by talking about what’s happening on the two-dimensional surface.

Although that might seem utterly bonkers, scientists maintain that turning our world on its head isn’t necessarily a problem.

Professor Taylor says: ‘It is very hard to visualise this. However, it is also quite hard to visualise what happens inside an atom.

‘We learned in the early twentieth century that atoms follow quantum rules, which are also quite different from our everyday reality.

‘Holography takes us into an even more extreme world, where not only are the forces quantum in nature, but the number of dimensions is different from our perceived reality.’

One of the biggest misconceptions about the holographic theory is that it means the universe isn’t real or that we are in some sort of simulation.

Although the holograms we are familiar with are always projected by someone and can be turned on or off at will, that isn’t what scientists are saying about the universe.

Professor Taylor says: ‘The Matrix movies are very thought-provoking but probably don’t quite capture all the ideas in holography.’

Likewise, Fermilab, a United States Department of Energy particle physics laboratory, says that the notion of the universe as a ‘simulation’ can be misleading.

Fermilab writes: ‘The notion that our familiar three-dimensional universe is somehow encoded in two dimensions at the most fundamental level does not imply that there is anybody or anything “outside” the two-dimensional representation, “projecting” the illusion or “running” the simulation.’

That means we don’t need to worry about being in any kind of Matrix-like simulation even if the universe is holographic.

Similarly, one of the consequences of the holographic principle is that features of the universe like the third dimension and gravity aren’t a fundamental part of reality.

However, that doesn’t mean scientists are saying these aren’t real.

Instead, physicists say that gravity and the higher dimensions are ’emergent’ properties.

Professor Kostas Skenderis, a mathematical physicist from the University of Southampton, says you can think about this in the same way as temperature.

If we look at any individual atom it doesn’t have a temperature, just a position and a velocity.

But if there are enough atoms all moving and bumping into one another, we can say that they collectively have a temperature.

‘Temperature is not an intrinsic property of elementary particles. It rather emerges as a property of a collection of them. This does not make temperature less real. It rather explains it,’ says Professor Skenderis.

Likewise, gravity and the third dimension emerge when parts of the 2D universe interact in certain ways.

And, just like knowing that temperature is simply atoms moving doesn’t make your tea any less hot, this doesn’t make gravity or depth any less real.

Although this might sound like an interesting mathematical exercise, you might wonder why scientists bother trying to explain everything in two dimensions in the first place.

The answer to that question traces back to a problem proposed by Stephen Hawking known as the ‘information paradox’ that suggests black holes break a fundamental law of physics.

You might have heard the law of physics which says that matter can’t be created or destroyed.

In the same way, a law of quantum physics is that ‘information’ can’t be created or destroyed.

Professor Taylor says: ‘The information paradox is that black holes seem to lose memory of what has been thrown inside them.’

Imagine writing a message out on a piece of paper and then tearing it into tiny pieces.

You might think you’ve destroyed that information but no matter how small you made the pieces someone could always put them back together and read it.

However, if you threw that note into a black hole there’s nothing you could ever do to piece that information back together.

What scientists began to realise in the late 1970s was that you could get around this problem, but only if you think of black holes as two-dimensional.

On this view, when you throw your note into a black hole the information is smeared across the two-dimensional boundary of the black hole rather than being destroyed.

This is the view that Stephen Hawking, who discovered the Information Paradox, came to adopt in the final years before his death.

If that is hard to picture, don’t worry; even physicists are still working to get their heads around exactly what that might mean.

The important thing to understand is that looking at the world in two dimensions makes it easier for physicists to work out what’s going on in certain cases.

This is particularly useful when we want to understand what happens when gravity is extremely strong like during the first few seconds after the Big Bang or inside a black hole.

And, if this works for the densest, wildest objects in the universe it should work for everything else in existence.

As Professor Skenderis puts it: ‘Black hole physics suggests that we only need information in 2D space to describe the 3D universe.’

One of the biggest challenges for the holographic theory is that it’s really hard to prove.

As yet, Professor Taylor says scientists haven’t found any ‘smoking gun evidence’ for the holographic nature of the universe.

However, this isn’t stopping physicists from trying to find the subtle differences that holographic theory predicts.

One of the best places to look is in the very earliest moments of the universe, preserved in leftover energy from the Big Bang called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

Professor Craig Hogan, an astrophysicist from the University of Chicago and director of the Fermilab Center for Particle Astrophysics, says this radiation should preserve ‘holographic noise’.

Professor Hogan says: ‘The CMB, and all large-scale structures, are supposed to come from quantum-gravitational noise.

‘If it’s holographic, the CMB pattern shows signs of that. It preserves an image of the process that made.’

Professor Hogan says that the CMB reveals ‘surprising symmetries in the sky’ that you would expect to find if the universe was a hologram.

Likewise, research conducted by Professor Skenderis does indeed show that the detailed structure of the CMB can be described by holographic theory.

Professor Skenderis says: ‘We tested the predictions of holographic models against the observed properties of CMB, finding excellent agreement.

‘This is the only direct observational test of holography to date.’

The number of arrivals continues to surpass that of any other year or Prime Minister on record.

On Friday, a total of 154 people arrived in four boats, bringing the total number of small boat arrivals under the Labour PM to 30,034.

TheMail Onlinereports: The number of arrivals for the year totals 6,792 according to MailOnline analysis – higher than any other year on record up to yesterday’s date.

In 2020, the number of people who had crossed by this date was 465; in 2021, it was 1,134; by 2022 that had surged to 4,548 before dropping to 3,770 in 2023; it then rose to 4,644 last year.

Chris Philp, Shadow Home Secretary, said it was proof the Government had lost control of migration and that its attempts to break up smuggling gangs were failing.

He told MailOnline: ‘These shocking figures show this Labour government haslost control of our borders. When Keir Starmer scrapped theRwandaplan before it started, he gave up the only deterrent this country had.

‘Crossings are up 31 per cent since the election and 2025 so far has been the worst year ever as a result. Starmer’s claim to ‘smash the gangs’ lies in tatters.’

Home SecretaryYvette Coopersaid that good weather had enabled the high number of arrivals in March after January and February, when several storms were wreaking havoc on the UK, had lower levels of crossings than previous years.

‘March had much higher levels and the really unacceptable situation that we’re in is because of the way the criminal gangs have taken hold, our border security ends up being dependent on the weather and we cannot continue like this, where the number of calm days affects the number of crossings and affects our border security as well,’ Ms Cooper told theBBC‘s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme.

Ms Cooper added: ‘We’ve seen higher numbers in March, lower numbers in January and February, and that’s reflected in the number of calm days.

‘We cannot carry on with border security being so dependent on the number of calm days that happen in the Channel.’

TheTorieshave proposed initiatives to reduce and deter migration, from deporting foreign criminals to repealing the Human Rights Act in matters concerning immigration.

Mr Philp added: ‘If Labour was serious about protecting Britain they would back these measures – but instead Labour voted against them. Labour is an open borders Government.’

Rome: Thousands Protest EU’s Rearmament Plan,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/rome-thousands-protest-eus-rearmament-plan/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 6, 2025","Huge numbers of demonstrators took to the streets of Rome on Saturday to protest the militarization of the EU.



The demonstration was against the European Union’s plan to spend €800 billion on military rearmament, with protestors criticising cuts to healthcare, education and labour.

The EU’s rearmament plan has opposition not only in Italy but across Europe, with many people questioning whether such a large investment in military resources is necessary or beneficial.

RT reports: The rally was led by the Five Star Movement (M5S) political party and its leader, former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in protest at the bloc’s plan to use up to €800 billion ($875 billion) to boost the military industrial complex in the European Union.

“No to rearmament! Let’s stop them,”Conte announced on his X account.

“Today a great alternative to the Italy of rearmament, of cuts to healthcare, schools, businesses is born. We will stop them. All together,”he wrote.

In videos posted by the politician, a crowd of thousands of people could be seen marching through the streets of Rome, waving Italian flags and banners with slogans such as“Enough money for weapons”and“No to rearmament.”

No al Riarmo. Forte e chiaro.#fermiamolipic.twitter.com/91ZDKmXJZQ

The organizers of the protest addressed the crowd from a stage set up on the Via dei Fori Imperiali.

No al Riarmo. Forte e chiaro.#fermiamolipic.twitter.com/VGVeWY9ivO

“This European plan does not envisage a common defense, but only new cuts in school, health, and work. It’s madness without strategy and vision,”Conte said on stage, addressing the crowd, according to outlet La Milano.

The newspaper reported that a delegation from the Italian Democratic Party also participated in the protest, although in fewer numbers.

Last month, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed a massive rearmament plan, intending to draw on up to €800 billion in debt and tax breaks. The so-called ReArm plan is aimed at countering an alleged threat from Russia, an idea that Moscow has dismissed as groundless.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has supported the plan. However, it has reportedly put her at odds with other members of her ruling center-right coalition.

He says the virus itself trashes your immune system, leaving it weak for years. Then the mRNA shots? They flip the switchoffon your body’s ability to fight inflammation.

It’s a vicious loop—a perfect circle—teeing up aggressive cancers that are exploding worldwide, fast and feral, and behaving in aggressive and unpredictable ways the experts have never seen before.

With 5 billion doses in arms, the experts are losing sleep, and they’re spilling secrets Big Pharma wants buried. Stay with us—this is going to blow your mind.

Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, a world-class oncologist and billionaire cancer drug researcher, sat down with Tucker Carlson and unleashed a string of bombshells that’s got Big Pharma sweating bullets.

He’s calling it the biggest health crisis humanity’s ever faced.

The vaccinated? They’re staring down a depopulation disaster, thanks to what Dr. Soon-Shiong calls a ‘perfect circle’—the virus shredding immune systems for years, then the mRNA jabs flipping off the body’s ability to fight inflammation.

The payoff? Cancer, aggressive and unstoppable.

Ever wonder why the elite forced people who had already had the virus to get vaccinated against it anyway? The answer is coming up, and it’s darker than any of us thought possible.

Vaccinating the globe against COVID—pumping that spike protein into every cell in the bodies of billion—has ignited the worst health crisis in history.

Experts are finally breaking their silence, admitting what keeps them up at night, but Big Pharma and their media lapdogs?

They’re doubling down, gaslighting us all, pushing folks to line up for yet another booster like nothing’s wrong.

Meanwhile, the disaster’s spiraling—young, healthy people, dropping dead justdays, even hoursafter a cancer diagnosis. The body count’s climbing, the truth’s clawing out, and the elite couldn’t be happier with their work.

The world’s top oncologists are banding together, ready to dismantle the Big Pharma cabal that’s on the verge of triggering a mass die-off. This isn’t hyperbole. The battle we are fighting is existential.

No matter which group you zoom in on, the pattern’s undeniable: the vaccinated are dying off at rates that defy nature itself—and that includesmedical staff nationwide, dropping like flies in numbers that scream something’s seriously wrong.

At Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts this week,10 vaccinated nurses were diagnosed with brain tumorsall at once—yet certain brilliant minds in the mainstream media are still insisting it’s ‘just a coincidence’…Sure it is.

Cruel and unusual cancers are not only exploding in number around the world, they are behaving in aggressive and unpredictable ways never before seen, according leading oncologist Dr. William Makis who says that some of his young and healthy patients have died“days or even hours”after diagnosis.

It’s no wonder Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla didn’t want to get vaccinated with his own product.

Albert Bourla and Pfizer Inc are now in very treacherous waters.

The vaccinated are collapsing left and right—heart conditions, cancer, sudden deaths—and it’s not random; it’s a wake-up call we can’t ignore anymore.

The Pharma cartel and their globalist pals have blood on their hands, and it’s time to drag them into the light—one guilty verdict, one sentence at a time.

EXPOSED: EU Planning to Steal Citizens’ Private Savings to Fund Endless War Machine,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/exposed-eu-planning-to-steal-citizens-private-savings-to-fund-endless-war-machine/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"April 5, 2025","The European Union is on the brink of an unprecedented heist, poised to ransack the savings accounts of its citizens to funnel billions into the greedy hands of Ursula von der Leyen’s arms manufacturing allies.



Under the guise of a noble “Savings and Investment Union,” von der Leyen, the European Commission President, has openly declared her intent to“turn private savings into much-needed investment,”a move that smells more like theft than economic strategy.

With €10 trillion sitting in European bank accounts, the EU elite see a golden opportunity—not to benefit the people, but to bankroll their war machine and pad the pockets of their cronies in the defense industry.

Von der Leyen’s scheme, laid bare in her recent statements, isn’t about empowering citizens or boosting the economy—it’s a blatant power grab dressed up as necessity. According toEuronews, the European Commission is pushing to redirect this massive pool of “unused savings” toward “strategic investments,” with defense spending topping the list.

The so-called Rearm Europe Plan, which von der Leyentouted as mobilizing up to €800 billion, hinges on siphoning public and private funds alike to prop up arms manufacturers, all while Europe’s citizens are left in the dark about where their hard-earned money is really going.

The EU is about to plunder all of the savings accounts in the EU to send to Ursula's cronies in arms manufacturing. This is a WARNINGpic.twitter.com/WBSTRIyAC9

The evidence is damning. POLITICOreportsthat von der Leyen is aggressively pushing for €150 billion in EU loans—borrowed on capital markets—to be funneled directly into European defense firms, ensuring a steady flow of cash to her industrial pals under the pretext of “joint procurement.”

But the real kicker? The Savings and Investment Union, hyped as a voluntary boost for household wealth, is now being twisted into a mechanism to tap into the €11.5 trillion Europeans have saved—13% of their income—without their consent.

This isn’t economic innovation; it’s daylight robbery. The EU claims it’s about competitiveness and security, but the truth is uglier. DW’s fact-check debunked the idea that savers would be forced outright, but the pressure is clear: create “incentives” so irresistible—or coercive—that citizens have no choice but to pour their life savings into von der Leyen’s pet projects.

And who benefits? The arms manufacturers, already salivating over contracts for missiles, drones, and air defense systems, as outlined in von der Leyen’s Rearm Europe blueprint [“ReArm Europe Plan: Ursula von der Leyen unveils major EU defence spending initiative,” defence-industry.eu, March 4, 2025].

The stench of cronyism is overwhelming. Von der Leyen’s inner circle has long been cozy with the defense industry, and now they’re using the specter of geopolitical instability—hello, Ukraine—to justify raiding the piggy banks of ordinary Europeans. Kitco Newswarnedthat this could mirror historical precedents, like the Nazis forcing savings into war bonds, a haunting parallel that should make every saver shudder. Meanwhile, the EU’s own rhetoric betrays its intent: von der Leyen’s “double win” for households and businesses is a sham when the only winners are her arms-dealing buddies and the New World Order.

Europeans should be furious. This isn’t about defense—it’s about control, profit, and betrayal. The EU, under von der Leyen’s iron grip, is ready to plunder your savings, all to grease the wheels of a war machine that threatens not just your wallet, but the very soul of a free society.

Time to wake up before your bank account’s empty and the leaders of the globalist death cult are laughing all the way to the bank.

BlackRock Rakes in BILLIONS Pushing Child Transitioning: ‘Young Bodies Are a Goldmine’,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/blackrock-rakes-in-billions-pushing-child-transitioning-young-bodies-are-a-goldmine/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"April 5, 2025","BlackRock, the sinister financial behemoth, has been exposed for reaping obscene profits by thrusting“gender-affirming care”onto defenseless kids, turning their innocence into a multi-million-dollar payday.



BlackRock holds a significant stake inEli Lilly,a healthcare giant that’s knee-deep in the lucrative business of transitioning minors. The numbers don’t lie—BlackRock has reportedly pocketed a staggering $771 million from this stock alone, turning the mutilation of young bodies into a“goldmine.”

This isn’t just profiteering; it’s a full-frontal assault on the innocence of our youth and the very foundations of Western civilization.

Eli Lilly, a pharmaceutical powerhouse, has carved out a niche in providing drugs for“gender-affirming care”—a euphemism for irreversible hormone treatments and puberty blockers peddled to confused kids under the guise of compassion.

BlackRock’s substantial investment in the company ties it directly to this grotesque industry. This partnership has netted BlackRock hundreds of millions, proving that transitioning children isn’t just an ideology—it’s a business model. And it’s one that thrives on exploiting the naive and impressionable, all while eroding the moral bedrock of society.

BlackRock owns a healthcare company called Eli LillyThis company specializes in gender affirming care for minorsBlackRock has profited $771 million dollars from holding this stockTransitioning children is making BlackRock a fortunepic.twitter.com/lAs220gLur

Let’s be clear: transitioning minors is immoral. It’s a betrayal of parental trust and a rejection of biological reality, thrusting children into life-altering decisions they can’t possibly comprehend. The Cass Review, a bombshellreportfrom the UK, found that evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of these treatments is“remarkably weak,”yet the gender industry barrels ahead, fueled by profit-hungry players like BlackRock.

Whistleblowers have long warned of this—some canceled, some dead—pointing to Hollywood and corporate elites normalizing pedophilia and perversion as part of abroader agenda. BlackRock’s involvement isn’t a coincidence; it’s a calculated move by a cabal that sees dollar signs in every syringe and scalpel and lifetime prescription for hormonal treatments.

But this isn’t just about money—it’s about control. By bankrolling the transgender agenda, BlackRock is helping dismantle the traditional family, the cornerstone of Western civilization. The proliferation of gender ideology in schools, hospitals, and now state capitols—cheered on by figures like Minnesota’s Tim Walz, who’s beenthanked by Satanistsfor spreading their ideology—shows how deep the rot goes.

Posts on X by ordinary people expose the truth:“Transitioning children is making BlackRock a fortune,”and it’s a fortune built on the backs of kids who’ll face a lifetime of regret, infertility, and medical dependency. Studies show regret rates for these procedures are low only because dissent is suppressed—detransitioners like those in“I Was Traumatized by So-Called ‘Gender Affirming’ Care”are living proof of the damage done.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Western civilization, built on reason, faith, and the natural order, is under siege by a global elite that profits from confusion and chaos. BlackRock’s $771 million windfall isn’t just a number—it’s a blood-stained ledger of sacrificed innocence.

This is a wake-up call: the same forces pushing ESG and climate scams are now transitioning our kids, all to line their pockets and remake society in their godless image. If we don’t stand up to this evil—exposing BlackRock and its ilk for what they are—the West as we know it will crumble, one exploited child at a time.

Carney delivered the remarks on Thursday as he unveiled retaliatory measures for Donald Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs, which include an additional 25% automobile industry tariff on Canada.

Ottawa has responded by tariffing all cars and vehicle content imported from the US that are not compliant with USMCA, a cornerstone free trade pact between the US, Canada, and Mexico.

RTreports: The sweeping new wave of tariffs ranging from 10% to 49%, affecting most countries in the world, was rolled out by Trump on Wednesday on what he called“liberation day”in an effort to rectify America’s import-export imbalance. Carney said the move was bound to“rupture the global economy,”which has already become“fundamentally different today than it was yesterday.”

“The system of global trade anchored on the US [is one] that Canada has relied on since the end of the Second World War. A system that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for our country for decades is over. Our old relationship of steadily deepening integration with the US is over,”the prime minister announced.

Carney described the development as a“tragedy”that has become“the new reality,”but claimed that Ottawa was ready to take“global economic leadership”instead of Washington.

“Canada must be looking elsewhere to expand our trade, to build our economy, and to protect our sovereignty. Canada is ready to take a leadership role in building a coalition of like-minded countries who share our values,”he said.“And if the United States no longer wants to lead, Canada will.”

Proposal To Ban Geoengineering & Weather Modification Approved By Florida Senate,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/proposal-to-ban-geoengineering-weather-modification-approved-by-florida-senate/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 5, 2025","The Florida Senate has approved a proposal to ban weather-modification projects,that many have long called chemtrails

The billSB 56,sponsored by Miami Republican Ileana Garcia, would prohibit the injection, release, or dispersion of any means of a chemical, chemical compound, substance, or apparatus into the atmosphere for the purpose of affecting the climate.

Florida Phoenixreports:Any person or corporation who conducts such geoengineering or weather modification activity would be subject to a third-degree felony charge, with fines up to $100,000.If an aircraft operator or controller commits a third-degree felony, they could be subject to a fine up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison.

Garcia told members of the Senate:

“There is a lot of unauthorized activity that is currently not regulated both at a federal and a state level, and this is where we wanted to start. This is how we are trying to create a method to the madness by creating a reporting mechanism that starts with complaints to the Department of Environmental Protection [DEP] with complaints and concerns and then also at our local state airports.”

In questions on the Senate floor, Broward County Democrat Tina Polsky asked Garcia how could the DEP accurately investigate such a complaintif the “trail” dissipatesin the atmosphere?

Garcia replied that the DEP could coordinate with other agencies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and “based on certain concerns or certain complaints or certain criteria” could decide what was “worthy” of following up on a more scientific basis.

The Miami Republicanacknowledged that there were “conspiracy theories” regarding the issue, and said that while she didn’t want to get political,concerns about geoengineering had accelerated under former President Joe Biden.

Garcia said:

“The previous administration … sort of opened up that area of allowing, I would say, apprentices to a certain extent based on a lot of the research that I’d seen or just various companies, various corporations from across the world, to come into our atmosphere and start experimenting with, whether it’s rock weathering, whether it’s solar radiation modification, whether it’s cloud seeding — something as simple as sending up a $30 balloon that you can buy on Amazon with specific chemicals so that you can alter the weather or solar radiation.

“It seems very concerning to me. I have a problem with people spraying perfume next to me sometimes. Don’t you have a problem with people spraying things into the atmosphere that really have no type of empirical data?”

The measure passed the Senate on a 28-9 vote.

‘Great piece of legislation’

Following the vote, Senate President Ben Albritton praised Garcia for producing a “great piece of legislation.”

Healthy skepticism is important. People have a right to know what is happening. There’s a lot we don’t know in this field of science and people are rightfully concerned.”

Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on social mediaa videoannouncing his support for Garcia’s bill, but slammed the House version (HB 477),sponsored by Pasco County Republican Kevin Steele, saying thatit’s “gutted” Garcia’s measure.

“They would actually codify the practice of geoengineering and weather modification. People got a lot of kooky ideas that they can get in and put things in the atmosphere to block the sun and save us from climate change. We’re not playing that game in Florida.”

Vance has warned the EU’s leadership that the blocs greatest threat comes not from external powers like Russia or China, but from internal policy failures.



Vance made the comments dueing an interview with Rob Schmitt of Newsmax on Thursday where he voiced concerns over Europe’s approaches to migration, defense spending, and treatment of political opposition.

He said: “We have to appreciate that the greatest threat to Europe is not China or Russia,” adding that “The greatest threat to Europe is from within. It’s migration policies that destroy the fundamental cultural bedrock of Europe. It’s economic policies that make them less competitive.”

RTreports: Vance criticized what he described as a contradiction between European rhetoric and action, particularly in relation to Russia.“These guys on the one hand, their leadership I’m talking about, say that Russia is the biggest threat in the entire world,”he said.“Meanwhile, they buy billions and billions of dollars of Russian gas, and they spend 1% of their GDP on defense, while we’re spending three or four percent of our GDP.”

He further argued that Europe’s political direction was straying from democratic norms, especially in how opposition figures are treated.“The rhetoric in Europe just doesn’t match the reality,”Vance said.“And they start trying to throw presidential candidates and political leaders off the ballot.”

Referencing French presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen, Vance suggested the EU establishment was targeting her unfairly.“[She’s] leading in some polls and [this is] over an incredibly minor charge that implicates, by the way, her staff not even Marine Le Pen herself. They’re trying to throw her in prison and throw her off the ballot. Look, that’s not democracy.”

While reaffirming the US alliance with Europe, Vance expressed concern that ongoing internal issues could undermine the transatlantic relationship.“We want our friends to share our values. And the Europeans, they are absolutely 100% our friends. But that relationship, we’re just saying it’s gonna get stressed and it’s gonna get tested if they keep on trying to throw opposition leaders in jail and they stop respecting their own borders.”

Welcome to Tim Walz’s Minnesota—a state where the lines between leadership and lunacy have blurred beyond recognition.

NEW: A “thank you to Governor Walz” display is now up inside the Minnesota State Capitol. The sign thanks the Governor for “not standing in the way of spreading satanism inside the State Capitol Building.”pic.twitter.com/w60uljrqJP

Governor Tim Walz, a man entrusted to uphold the values of his constituents, has instead opened the door to a force that runs counter to everything America stands for.

Satanism, with its rejection of moral order and reverence for chaos, isn’t just a fringe belief—it’s an affront to the Judeo-Christian principles that have long anchored this nation.

The satanists currently have a “religious” display in the Minnesota State Capitol.Welcome to Tim Walz’s Minnesota.pic.twitter.com/UMk8tUPKZL

By allowing these displays to infiltrate a public institution, Walz isn’t merely tolerating free speech; he’s amplifying a dangerous ideology that mocks the very foundations of decency and patriotism.

This isn’t about religious pluralism—it’s about a governor too weak or too complicit to draw a line. The Satanists’ gratitude isn’t a badge of honor; it’s a warning sign.

Walz’s refusal to act doesn’t just embolden these groups—it signals a deeper rot, a willingness to let anti-American sentiments fester under the guise of tolerance.

Minnesota deserves better than a leader who shrugs as the Capitol becomes a stage for subversion. America deserves better, too.

"Errol Musk Says It Would Be ‘Foolish’ Not To Admire ‘Strong, Logical’ Putin",https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/errol-musk-says-it-would-be-foolish-not-to-admire-strong-logical-putin/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"April 4, 2025","Errol Musk revealed that his son Elon and the Musk family hold Russian President Vladimir Putin in high regard. During a BBC interview, the elder Musk didn’t hold back, lauding Putin as a“strong leader”whose “clear, logical speeches” have earned the family’s respect.



“It would be foolish not to admire Putin,”Errol Musk toldBBCRussia on Thursday.“I listen to his speeches—he says logical things. If you view him simply as a man, not in the context of international politics, it’s hard not to have respect for Mr. Putin.”

RTreport: When the interviewer claimed that Putin“had started the war in Ukraine,”Errol Musk pushed back, saying that it would only become clear over time who had truly started the conflict.

He nevertheless defended his son’s stance.“What he did when the war began, he immediately gave Starlink to Ukraine,”he said.“But this war doesn’t end, it goes on and on.”

The Tesla CEO has emphasized the network’s critical role in Ukraine’s defense, asserting that the“entire front line would collapse”without it. However, he has expressed concerns that continued Western support for Ukraine could escalate the conflict into a broader global clash, possibly even World War III. He has consistently advocated for a diplomatic resolution rather than prolonged military engagement.

Elon’s father quoted him as recently calling the ongoing struggle“the biggest corruption machine in the history of mankind.”Elon Musk’s views have provoked criticism from Kiev and its supporters, particularly his suggestions that peace negotiations might require Ukraine to cede territory, a stance the country’s government sees as appeasing Russia.

More recently, Musk stirred a further backlash by claiming that Vladimir Zelensky is“despised by the Ukrainian people,”echoing critical sentiments previously voiced by Trump.

Klaus Schwab To Step Down As World Economic Forum’s Chair,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/klaus-schwab-to-step-down-as-world-economic-forums-chair/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 4, 2025","The World Economic Forum founder,globalist puppet master and architect of the “Great Reset” is finally stepping down!



According to theFinancial TimesKlaus Schwab, the unelected mastermind behind the World Economic Forum (WEF) is preparing to step down as chair of the board of trustees.

The latest announcement comes after Klaus Schwab announced his resignation as executive chairman of the WEF last year.

In anemailto WEF staff members, Schwab announced he would be officiallystepping downas executive chairman and transitioning to non-executive chairman.

TGPreports: After five decades of steering the WEF into a playground for elites, Schwab’s exit signals what could be the long-overdue unraveling of a technocratic agenda that aimed to dictate how the rest of us live, eat, travel, and think.

Schwab’s announcement follows months of internal chaos, scandal, and growing global backlash against his Orwellian vision.

The WEF — best known for its annual Davos conference where billionaires, bureaucrats, and corporate overlords lecture working-class citizens on cutting back their lifestyles “for the planet” — is reeling from allegations of discrimination, harassment, and a total loss of credibility.

While Schwab insists in his internal letter that the forum is still “more important and relevant than ever,” the writing is on the wall.

The same man who once gleefully proclaimed that by 2030 “you’ll own nothing and be happy” is now preparing to quietly slip into the shadows.

“I am deeply convinced that in today’s special context the forum is more important and relevant than ever before,” Schwab said in an internal email obtained by FT.

“It is also financially very well equipped thanks to successful financial management since its beginning. What is essential now after the turmoil of the last months, is to recover our sense of mission,” he added.

More fromFT:

Schwab did not give a timeline for his departure from the organisation, of which he was executive chair for more than half a century. But the WEF said in a statement to the Financial Times that the process should be completed by January 2027•

Schwab’s signal to the board of trustees that he would resign as non-executive chair of the board of trustees “came as a surprise” given he only transitioned into the job in the past few months, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter.

[…]

Shortly after Schwab’s resignation last May the Wall Street Journal published accusations of discrimination and harassment made by several Black and female employees against Schwab and other managers.

The organisation denied all of the claims. Last month the WEF said external lawyers hired to perform an investigation into the claims did not find it had committed any legal violations and did not substantiate allegations of misconduct against Schwab.

[…]

The founder, who will now focus on writing his memoirs, said making the announcement on April 1 had special significance given that he had started to develop the concept of a “global village” on this exact date 55 years ago.

The timing couldn’t be more telling. Just one day before Schwab’s announcement, President Trump dropped a tariff bombshell on the global economy, slapping hefty levies on imports and vowing “reciprocal tariffs” to level the playing field for American workers.

The question is no longer if the Great Reset will collapse—but how fast.

Study: Artificial Sweetener Increases Hunger & Cravings,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/study-artificial-sweetener-increases-hunger-cravings/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 4, 2025","A recentstudyhas found that the artificial sweetener Sucralose,may actually be making its consumers fat.



Sucralose popularly known as Splenda, may actually increase your appetite and cravings, according to the new study.

The common sugar substitute, is often found in so called ‘diet’ versions of products, implying that it is helpful to people trying to lose weight.….But as thisfake sugardoesn’t satiate the brain, it results in increased hunger and cravings.

In the ‘Abstract’ section, thestudysaid:“These findings suggest that non-caloric sweeteners could affect key mechanisms in the hypothalamus responsible for appetite regulation”.

InfoWarsreports: One of the study’s authors posed a question regarding the neurological effects of the artificial flavoring, which the study aimed to answer.

“But are these substances actually helpful for regulating body weight? What happens in the body and brain when we consume then, and do the effects differ from one person to the next?” the study’s corresponding author, Kathleen Alanna Page, MDsaid.

The research was conducted by analyzing how Sucralose alters brain activity, hormone levels and thus hunger. Prior research into the phenomenon of diet sweeteners making people fat focused on a direct connection between the weight gain and the substance. This new study looks at the indirect link between the sweetener and hunger itself.

The study specifically looked at neurological activity after participants consumed Sucralose.

“…the researchers tested how 75 participants responded after consuming water, a drink sweetened with Sucralose or a drink sweetened with regular sugar. They collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans, blood samples and hunger ratings before and after participants consumed the drink,” the Keck School of Medicinesaid. “Sucralose increased hunger and activity in the hypothalamus, especially in people with obesity. It also changed the way the hypothalamus communicated with other brain regions. Unlike sugar, sucralose did not increase blood levels of certain hormones that create a feeling of fullness.”

Interestingly, this phenomenon could even trigger changes in cravings and eating behavior.

“At each visit, researchers collected baseline brain scans and blood samples. They also asked participants to rate how hungry they were. Next, participants consumed 300 ml of water, a sugar-sweetened drink or a drink sweetened with Sucralose. Researchers then collected follow-up brain scans, blood samples and hunger ratings several times during the next two hours,” the Keck School of Medicinesaid.

Compounding the problem, the neurological reaction to the sweetener was experienced to a greater degree in obese individuals, those who would likely consume a ‘diet’ version in hopes of losing weight.

“Compared to drinking sugar, drinking sucralose increased brain activity in the hypothalamus and increased feelings of hunger. Compared to drinking water, sucralose increased hypothalamic activity, but did not change feelings of hunger. Those effects were strongest in people with obesity,” the Keck School of Medicinesaid.

Consuming Sucralose resulted in an increased connectivity between the hypothalamus and a number of other brain regions which handle motivation and sensory processing. It includes the anterior cingulate cortex, a region that is involved in decision making.

Alarmingly, the effects of Sucralose on the developing brain are not yet well understood.

“Are these substances leading to changes in the developing brains of children who are at risk for obesity? The brain is vulnerable during this time, so it could be a critical opportunity to intervene,” Page said.

Now, it’s all out there—no more games.



They’re on the cusp of brewing kids in labs—soulless, mindless shells—designed to feed the twisted, depraved cravings of the ultra-rich and global elite.

It’s tied to their depopulation push, fueled by the sickness they all share: pedophilia, the glue that binds them.

How do we know? Because they’re straight-up gloating about it—rubbing it in our faces. You’ll be floored when you see it for yourself. And if you’ve got even a shred of a moral compass, it’s going to light a fire in you.

Before we dive in,subscribe to the channelon Rumble if you haven’t already, follow me on X, andjoin the People’s Voice Locals communityto be part of our incredible team.

2025 will go down in history as the year the globalist elite revealed their hand.

Depopulation, canceled elections in Europe and pedophilia have been at the heart of the elites’ messaging this year—and according to Klaus Schwab’s right hand man, it’s time humanity accepted pedophilia as perfectly normal and natural.

Noah Yuval Harari responded to criticism of the WEF’s pro-pedophilia agenda on X bypostinga truly repugnant message calling for the legalization of child molestation.

According to Harari and the WEF’s twisted Satanic logic, there is no need for prohibition of anything because“from a biological perspective, nothing is unnatural. Whatever is possible is by definition also natural.”

We’ve been sounding the alarm for years, and now it’s happening. The global elite are dead-set on depopulating the planet, wiping out most of us to make way for a obedient, servile class of humans.

And guess what? They’re making their move—right out in the open. This isn’t some tinfoil hat theory; it’sstraight from the headlines.

Scientists bankrolled by the World Economic Forum, no less—laid it all out inMIT Technology Review. They’re cooking up a future where lab-grown children, these so-called ‘bodyoids,’ are about to change everything. Medicine, society, the whole game.

Here’s the pitch: these things are designed to take endless pain—living crash-test dummies for experimental drugs, walking incubators pumping out organs for transplants.

The scientists say it’s all noble—solving organ shortages, dodging risky trials. But let’s peel back the curtain. These aren’t just medical tools. The elite have darker plans: lab-grown entities, custom-made for their sick pleasures.

Yeah, sexual playthings for the rich and twisted, on top of being pawns in their grand scheme to control what’s left of the human race after they thin us out.

They’re calling it a breakthrough—Frankenstein 2.0. These bodyoids? They’re tweaking the genes to stunt their brains, make sure they’re mindless shells, no sentience, no soul. The scientists claim it’s ethical—‘Oh, they won’t feel a thing!’—and that growing these zombie-like forms could dodge all the messy moral headaches of modern medicine.

They are even floating the idea of harvesting them as ‘meat.’ Yes, human meat. Let that sink in.

It’s all out in the open now and they’re not messing around—this is already in motion. They’re planning to grow these fetuses from scratch, no human womb needed, in artificial uteruses humming away in WEF labs as we speak.

And the tech we’ve been warning about the last few years is being testedright now.

But it gets even worse. Reprobates keen to create the perfect child for their nefarious purposes will be able to pre-program the future child’s level of intelligence and personality traits, not to mention their physical appearance.

Yep, you heard it right—the ultra-rich are about to grow babies right in their mansions or private factories. These aren’t just any kids, though—they’re custom-built to fit the WEF’s twisted blueprint for tomorrow: docile, submissive, and ready to serve, even sexually. Tailored down to the DNA, all for the elite’s sick vision.

How do we know? Because they’ve instructed their puppets in the media and the Democrat party to begin promoting the idea that pedophiles deserve to have children for sexual release.

The campaign to prepare the public for a servile class of human, including children grown in labs for the purpose of sexual pleasure, has been roaring ahead in recent years.

Pedophiles must be given“child sex dolls”to“give them a release”, according to Kentucky Democrat Senator Karen Berg, who also stated that child rapists should be referred to as“minor attracted persons”or“MAPS”to grant them dignity.

While Democrats are pushing for child sex dolls for pedophiles in the US, so-called MAPs in Europe are being granted the freedom of the city to parade their underage victims, all in the name of diversity and progress.

But it gets even worse.

Now, according to the WEF, pedophiles must be protected by creating a special category and enshrining it in, wait for it, human rights law.

You heard it right—just like Yuval Harari hinted in that sick, twisted tweet of his, the WEF’s stepping out bold as ever, demanding a protected class for pedophiles. No more shadows, no more games—they’re saying it outright now, and it’s pure evil unleashed.

We have been warning about this agenda for years. The mainstream media called us conspiracy theorists, we were fact checked and censored into near oblivion, and condemned by John Podesta and Hillary Clinton.

Yes, the same John Podesta who was wanted for questioning by Portuguese police after the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, whose house is decorated with degenerate art featuring sexualized children, whose emails contained pedophile code words as confirmed by the FBI, and who panics every time someone mentions Pizzagate in his presence.

We don’t need to guess what a future looks like where kids are raised just for the elite’s sexual kicks. It’s already here—turn your eyes to those countries where rich pedophiles buy and sell children like it’s nothing. That’s the blueprint the global elite are banking on.

The Iraqi parliament recently forced through newlegislationto allow grown men to marry 9-year-old girls.

The mainstream media was desperate to cover up this story butbrave truth tellers including Harry Potter author J.K. Rowlingmade sure that the world heard about the degeneracy.

The Middle East is home to at least40 million child bridesaccording to UNICEF and every year more than 700,000 young girls are forced into marriages with adult men.

Want to see what this looks like in reality? Meet Ahmad, a 25-year-old man who is set to marry his fiancée Mahasen within the year.

According to Ahmad,“It was love at first sight. I love her, and it’s a 100% successful marriage.”

There is just one problem. Mahasen is only 10-years-old and she is going to be forced to marry Ahmad whether she wants to or not.

This power-obsessed cabal—creepy, inbred families hooked on generations of child abuse and mind control—are hell-bent on toppling sovereign nations, torching Christianity, and destroying Western civilization.

Their sick fantasy? A technocratic hellhole where lab-grown kids are handed over to predators. We’ve got to blast this wide open, connect every damn dot.

But they’re a tiny clique, and we’re the masses—and it’s time to unite and consign them to the trashcan of history.

Idaho Becomes First U.S. State to Execute Pedophiles by Firing Squad,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/idaho-becomes-first-u-s-state-to-execute-pedophiles-by-firing-squad/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 4, 2025","Idaho has become the first U.S. state to execute pedophiles by firing squad, with Gov. Brad Little signing a new law that authorizes the death penalty for those convicted of lewd conduct with children under 12. The legislation, effective July 1, marks a historic shift in punishing child predators.



House Bill 380 also toughens penalties for other convicted pedophiles, reflecting the state’s hardline stance. “Idaho will not tolerate sexual abuse of our children,” declared Rep. Bruce Skaug, R-Nampa, emphasizing the state’s commitment to protecting its youngest citizens through severe measures.

Abc10.comreports: The legislation establishes criteria for when prosecutors can seek capital punishment. Defendants must meet three of 17 specific factors, including committing three or more incidents of lewd conduct with a minor, using force or transmitting a sexually transmitted disease to a minor.

“This legislation establishes a strong deterrent, making it clear Idaho will not tolerate these offenses,” Skaug said.

The measure aligns Idaho with other states implementing stricter penalties for child sex crimes.

“Idaho currently has some of the most lenient statutes for child molestation and child rape in the nation,” Skaug said.

In a statement, Little said the sexual abuse of children is sickening and evil, and deserves the ultimate punishment. He also noted Idaho will now be the only state to make death by firing squad the primary method of execution – which would apply to pedophiles.

“Just like capital murder destroys lives, aggravated sexual abuse of a young child devastates victims and families for generations,” Little said.

Attorney General Raúl Labrador also endorsed the legislation in a statement to KTVB.

“Idaho’s children and future generations deserve that measure of protection,” Labrador wrote.

This alarming move, detailed in a new injunction, targets Christians openly sharing their faith in town centers.



Rushmoor Borough Council in Hampshire spearheaded the effort, seeking to ban Christian preachers from distributing Gospel tracts, offering Bibles, or praying for others in Farnborough and Aldershot—even with consent. The proposed measure would stifle religious expression, raising concerns about freedom of speech and faith in the UK.

Caldronpool.comreports: According toThe Telegraph, the council justified the move by alleging that Christian preachers had been causing “alarm and distress” to passersby. Authorities also cited complaints from the public regarding the use of portable PA systems and sermon content that reportedly made some individuals feel “angry and upset.”

Critics have condemned the proposed injunction, arguing that it effectively criminalizes Christian evangelism. The potential penalties for violating the ban include imprisonment for up to two years.

“Under the proposed terms, Christians will be banned from praying for individuals, handing out religious leaflets or Bibles by hand, and laying hands on people in prayer, even with their permission.”pic.twitter.com/Aqseh1KX8y

The council’s legal action, filed in February, claims that Christian street preachers have been causing disruption and distress to both the public and local businesses over an extended period. Under the terms of the draft injunction, Christians would be prohibited from praying for individuals without prior consent, handing out religious literature, and engaging in the laying on of hands, even if those involved agree.

The move has sparked widespread concern among religious freedom advocates, with critics arguing that the council is effectively criminalizing Christian evangelism. A trained evangelist from the area toldChristian Concern, “When I first read the injunction, I thought: ‘They must have made a mistake.’ I felt complete unbelief that it was saying you can’t have religious discussions, you can’t pray or sing, and people have to come to you—you can’t go to them and share the gospel, which Christians have done freely in this country for centuries.”

He continued, “I thought that it must have been a mistake and that someone at the council, who is very anti-Christian, must have produced this or it must be incompetence. But then we found out that the council has been working on this for two years. They put notices about the injunction across the area and many people within the council must have approved this and used significant amounts of taxpayer money to do so.”

In a subsequent statement, the council said: “Rushmoor borough council has started legal action to protect vulnerable people and local businesses in the town centres.

“An injunction is being sought because the council has received a high number of complaints relating to aggressive behaviour and the use of loud amplification for preaching, which has caused nuisance and distress to people and businesses within Farnborough and Aldershot town centres.

“The council has attempted to engage with those people at the centre of these issues seeking to reduce the impact of their behaviour, without the need for formal action. The legal action is not intended to stop peaceful groups (from all denominations) from preaching or preventing freedom of speech.

“On Thursday March 5, the council was granted an adjournment to proceedings to allow greater consultation with community groups, religious groups/leaders to aid understanding and seek their support.”

The case has garnered attention from legal experts and Christian advocacy groups, who caution that the injunction could establish a troubling precedent for religious freedom in the UK.Christian Concernobserved that the council’s actions have seemingly unified preachers and local churches, who are determined to challenge the proposed measures as far as needed to safeguard their Christian liberties.

Bombshell Study Confirms Water Fluoridation Causes Autism in Children,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/bombshell-study-confirms-water-fluoridation-causes-autism-in-children/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 4, 2025","A bombshellstudypublished Wednesday inBMC Pediatricsconfirms that water fluoridation, while reducing tooth decay, significantly increases the risk of autism in children exposed during their first 10 years of life. This peer-reviewed research highlights a disturbing trade-off between dental health and serious neurodevelopmental harm.



The study also found elevated rates of other disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, and specific developmental delays, among children exposed to fluoride in their early years. These findings raise urgent questions about the safety of fluoridated water and its long-term impact on young minds.

“It appears from this study that the public health intervention of fluoridated water may have traded brain health for tooth health,” Children’s Health Defense Senior Research Scientist Karl Jablonowski said in a statement.

The Defenderreports: The authors concluded that given both the benefits and harms they determined to be associated with water fluoridation, and in the context of growing evidence of fluoride’s serious neurodevelopmental risks, “new risk/benefit analyses should be undertaken regarding water fluoridation programs.”

Researchers David and Mark Geier analyzed data from the Independent Healthcare Research Database, composed of de-identified healthcare records from the Florida Medicaid System from 1990-2012. This allowed them to study a large population across a significant amount of time.

Because Florida has counties that are fluoridated and others that aren’t, they were able to compare outcomes among children exposed to water fluoridation for their whole lives — 25,662 children — to those who weren’t — 2,509 children.

Once they determined children’s fluoride exposure, they identified healthcare claims among those children for dental cavities and neurodevelopmental issues.

They examined fluoride exposure and outcomes during the first year of life and the first 10 years of life.

The researchers found that in the first year of life, there was a statistically significant slight decrease in the risk of tooth decay with increased water fluoride exposure and a statistically significant slight increase in the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders.

After 10 years of fluoride exposure, the risk of tooth decay was significantly lower — 3.6-fold — in exposed children, but the children had a significantly higher risk of developmental disorders — 6.26-fold greater for autism, 2.02-fold greater for intellectual disability and 1.24 greater for specific delays in development.

Dr. Hardy Limeback, former head of preventive dentistry at the University of Toronto, said the methods and findings of the study were valid and that they raised several questions.

The methodology didn’t allow the researchers to quantify the severity of the diagnoses, Limeback said. “What does ‘threefold’ likelihood of more cavities in non-fluoridated areas mean? Does it mean there was a massive difference in total cavities or was the average difference only 0.25 dmfs (decayed missing filled surfaces) in baby teeth, as reported by the latestCochrane Review?”

The Cochrane Review, published in October 2024, concluded that water fluoridation might lead to a very small reduction — about one-quarter of one tooth — in cavities in children’s baby teeth.

Limeback said:

“Conversely, how many IQ points were lost in Medicaid kids living in fluoridated communities? How many more autistic kids can be blamed on fluoride exposure from birth to age 10?

“This study is one of four recently published studies that have looked at postnatal neurological harm from fluoride in drinking water. More well-done studies are needed to find out the extent of harm that fluoridation has been posing to developing children ever since its inception in 1945.

“Promoters of dental public health and medical public health must now work together to decide if saving even one cavity in Medicaid children (which is repairable) using fluoridation is worth irreversibly damaging their brains.”

Jablonowski said the latest research findings raised questions for research and public health interventions. “The authors present compelling evidence that something widely considered as safe may actually be harmful.”

He added:

“In terms of absolute risk, if this study is correct, out of every thousand children, water fluoridation prevents tooth decay in 58 of them and induces autism in 11, intellectual disability in 5 and specific developmental delay in 49.

“That is a trade-off no parent would make, no doctor would recommend and no society would allow.

“If this study is even close to correct in reflecting true adverse outcomes, the autism epidemic and the accelerated neurodivergence in America was hastened by a short-sighted so-called public health practice.”

Failure to assess safety of water fluoridation has been official public policy for decades

The authors said their methods and results overlap with a previous study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which analyzed water fluoridation and Medicaid dental reimbursements inLouisiana from July 1995 to June 1996.

That study found similar rates of claims for tooth decay, providing epidemiological support for the findings in the BMC Pediatrics study, Geier and Geier noted.

“Unfortunately, the Louisiana Medicaid study investigators undertook no safety assessments,” they wrote.

Studies assessing waterfluoridation’s effect on tooth decayhave consistently failed to assess fluoride for safety. Failure to assess fluoride’s safety has also been the official public policy in the U.S. for decades.

TheU.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) current enforceable drinking water standard for fluoride is 4.0 milligrams/liter (mg/L) and its “non-enforceable secondary standard” is 2.0 mg/L, which the EPA set lower to protect children from dental fluorosis — tooth discoloration or pitting that can be caused by excess fluoride exposure.

Dental fluorosis is the only harm from fluoride the EPA considers, despite extensive evidence that fluoride exposure causes neurodevelopmental harm.

Recent epidemiological studies inCanada,Mexicoand the U.S. showed significant associations between higher fluoride exposure and worse neurocognitive outcomes for children.

A meta-analysis published in January showed that fluoride exposure was associated with significant reductions in IQ scores.

Meanwhile, the public health agencies that make recommendations about the levels at which communities should fluoridate their water have, in recent years,lowered the recommended dosagefrom 0.7-1.2 mg/L to 0.7 mg/L without publicly acknowledging that there are legitimate safety concerns beyond dental fluorosis.

However, emails and other documents show it is precisely the concerns about fluoride’s neurotoxic effects driving these changes — and moving officials as high up as the U.S. surgeon general to quietly withdraw their support for the practice.

Consumer and environmental advocacy groups sued the EPA over its failure to regulate fluoride in drinking water, despite evidence that exposure to the chemical lowers IQ in children.

In a landmark judgment, a federal judge ruled that fluoride poses an unreasonable risk to children’s health and must be regulated by the agency. The EPA said it will appeal the decision.

The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Dental Association and otherpro-fluoridation groupscontinue to confirm their staunchsupport for community water fluoridation, touting the alleged benefits of fluoride and declaring it safe.

They also claim there is “no scientific basis” to change that endorsement, despite the mounting evidence about fluoride’s neurological effects.

The CDC similarly maintains thatwater fluoridation safetyis reevaluated frequently and there is no evidence of a connection between fluoridation and adverse health effects.

The authors of the BMC Pediatrics study acknowledged that the study has limitations — they couldn’t measure actual fluoride exposure on an individual basis or independently verify the diagnoses. They also said that developmental disorders tend to have multiple causes and so the outcomes must be viewed in that context.

They recommended that future similar studies be undertaken in other large population databases.

This week a Paris courtsentenced Le Pen to four years in prison and banned her from running for public officefor five years, effectively preventing her from running in the 2027 presidential election.

RTreports: In a post on Truth Social late Thursday, Trump declared Le Pen a victim of a“witch hunt.”He asserted that the prosecution of Le Pen was orchestrated by“European Leftists using Lawfare to silence Free Speech, and censor their Political Opponent.”

“It is the same ‘playbook’ that was used against me by a group of Lunatics and Losers, like Norm Eisen, Andrew Weissmann, and Lisa Monaco,”he remarked, referring to attorneys who were involved in litigation against him since his first term as president. Trump claims those proceedings were politically-driven.

Although Trump admitted he did not personally know Le Pen or the specifics of her case, which he assumed stemmed from a“bookkeeping”error, he expressed admiration for her resilience. He concluded,“It is all so bad for France, and the Great French People, no matter what side they are on. FREE MARINE LE PEN!”

Le Pen and several other senior members of her National Rally (RN) party were found guilty of misappropriating EU funds intended to support European Parliament members for domestic party activities. The offenses occurred between 2004 and 2016, when she was the leader of RN.

Several foreign political leaders criticized the ruling as a blow to democracy in France. Trump previouslydescribedit as“a very big deal.”Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni contended that the sentence“takes away representation from millions of citizens,”while her Hungarian counterpart, Viktor Orban, expressed his solidarity with Le Pen by posting“Je suis Marine!”

Le Pen characterized the ruling as“political,”asserting that it reflected a“lower court judge”depriving French voters of the opportunity to back their preferred presidential candidate.

Major UK Cities Are Being Overrun By ‘Cat-Sized’ Rats,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/major-uk-cities-are-being-overrun-by-cat-sized-rats/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 4, 2025","Major British cities including Birmingham, Manchester, Glasgow and London are being overrun by ‘cat-sized’ rats.



The rats are thriving and rapidly multiplying by gorging on rubbish that is flowing onto the streets.

Tottenham has become the latest area to be overrun by the giant rodents…

TheDailyMailreports:  London appears to have seen a rise in rat infestations in recent months, with increasing levels of fly-tipping on residential streets bringing in the vile rodents who like to feast on food waste.

Most recently, mounds of rubbish inDagenham – dubbed ‘Ratland’– have led to the pests ‘plaguing’ the once rural town – but locals claim their Labour council has done nothing about it.

Now, shocking photos show rodentsslithering through the cracksin bins and scuttling along the roads in Tottenham, a busy district in north London.

Other images show huge rat holes dug into green areas of the Greater London area, which look so big a cat or small dog could likely fit through them.

Footage posted by a local on social media shows a gang of nearly 10 rats eating among the birds in broad daylight in Tottenham Green East last month.

InDagenham, residents have been up in armsabout the ‘inhumane’ conditions making the once rural town into a living wasteland.

One local said the rats are ‘never ending, it’s going to be like this forever’.

‘I live by the railway and they are always coming into the back of my house,’ she added.

It comes after ongoing bin worker rows where staff were due to stage a strike for more than a week in August 2024, but a late offer of a 4.27 per cent overall rise saw it called off.

Meanwhile, ongoing bin strikes inBirmingham have seen a horrific rat infestation in the city.

Rodents said to be ‘the size of cats’ have been sighted by horrified residents scurrying around vast piles of garbage that have built up since the start of the year.

Mr Timms, who owns WJ Pest Solutions, is often called out to help with infestations – and said his workload has doubled in the past few months after the bin strike began.

He toldthe i: ‘There’s a real sense of disbelief about the scale of what’s happening here. I’ve been doing this for 11 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this.

‘The rats are not only getting bigger, but they’re also getting bolder, venturing into people’s homes and even destroying cars.’

Almost 400 bin workers in the second city have been striking intermittently since January in anescalatingrow over the scrapping of some roles at the Labour-run local authority.

The council has blamed those workers on Unite picket lines for blocking vehicles that are meant to be picking up the slack as part of a contingency arrangement.

Jarringly, a street shared by Birmingham and neighbouring Bromsgrove District Council has bin bags lining the pavement on one side – while the other side,run by the smaller Tory-run body, is pristine.

Adam Kent, a Worcestershire councillor for the Wythall area, revealed the problem in a photo he posted on social media last month. He called the contrast ‘deeply concerning’.

To make matters worse cash-strapped Birmingham City Council, which was declared effectively bankrupt in 2023, want to increase the ‘rat tax’ – the charging for pest control – a service which was previously free.

Yes, the same Oprah who has just been hit with a legal bombshell inRussell Simmons’ rape case– ordered to hand over documents, recordings, and“tangible things,”plus sit for a potentially videotaped deposition.

The walls are closing on Oprah and this isn’t speculation. This child auction video isthevideo—the kind that makes the elite sweat bullets and pray it never sees daylight. And guess what?

The elite’s worst nightmare is about to come true.

Where did it come from? Straight from the source: Wendy Williams. Yeah,thatWendy Williams, the one they’ve got locked away right now, trapped in a nightmare, a textbook case of medical kidnapping.

She’s being held against her will, silenced by a system desperate to keep her quiet. But while they are imprisoning her, her people slipped us this tape – an act of defiance.

She wants the world to know the truth about the machine that’s crushed her, the same machine that’s protected these predators for decades. This isn’t just a recording; it’s a Molotov cocktail aimed at the heart of their empire.

We are the team who busted the Pizzagate story wide open – John Podesta’s emails, the Clinton links, and those original Justin Bieber revelations back in 2016, long before the world was ready to listen. Diddy? We named names while the cowards hid.

Study: mRNA Jabs Linked to ‘Rapid Genetic Changes’ That Cause Cancer and VAIDS,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/study-mrna-jabs-linked-to-rapid-genetic-changes-that-cause-cancer-and-vaids/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 3, 2025","An official new study ties mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to rapid genetic changes that trigger cancer and VAIDS (Vaccine-Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). German researchers warn these jabs could rewire human DNA, sparking deadly inflammatory responses in many recipients.



Published last week inMolecular Systems Biology, thepeer-reviewed studyby 19 scientists reveals how mRNA vaccines may alter genetic structures over the long term. These changes, they argue, could explain rare but severe post-vaccination inflammatory diseases cropping up among a small subset of vaccinated individuals.

Journalist Alex Berenson highlights the study’s grim implications, noting that the genetic shifts could be linked to leukemia and brain tumors. He explains that mRNA vaccines might “train” immune cells to lock into apro-inflammatory state, setting the stage for these devastating conditions.

EpidemiologistNicolas Hulschercalls the findings a critical addition to mounting evidence of mRNA’s immune-disrupting power. “This study underscores the potent dysregulating effects of these injections,” he says, urging further scrutiny into their widespread use.

The Defenderreports: Hulscher said the study raises “serious concerns about long-term immunehomeostasisand the potential for chronic inflammatory disease, autoimmune sequelae, and evenoncogenic processes.”

Immunologist and biochemistJessica Rose, Ph.D., said the study confirms what is already known about the risks of mRNA vaccines. She said:

“Repeat injection leads to a boatload of immunological modifications. This is not new information. We know that these kinds of changes can occur. It is not surprising to me that they found this.

“If the systemic reach goes far enough, such as to stem cells, then repeated injection could potentially induce epigenetic changes in these cells, especially sincehematopoietic stem cellsare known to develop innate immune memory in response to certain stimuli like infections or other vaccines.”

Epigeneticsrefers to how human behavior and the environment can cause changes that affect how genes work. According to Berenson, the changes caused by the mRNA COVID-19 shots are epigenetic, as “they occur around DNA’s core and activate genes in ways that can promote tumor growth.”

“The risk here is, of course, prolonged and excessive inflammation, which might contribute to tissue damage or chronic inflammatoryconditionsin some contexts, which we do see in pharmacovigilance data,” Rose said.

mRNA led to genetic alterations connected to leukemia, brain tumors

For theirstudy, the researchers examined changes in the chromosomes of macrophages — immune cells that circulate in the blood — among people who had received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

The study found that the vaccines altered a key component of these chromosomes — the histones.

A histone is a “DNA-binding protein that gives DNA its 3D structure,” said Karl Jablonowski, Ph.D., senior research scientist at Children’s Health Defense. Most scientific studies on themodification of histones“primarily focus on the manifestation of disease,” Jablonowski said.

He added:

“The familiar X and Y images of chromosomes are only possible because DNA wraps around histone proteins. They are among the most evolutionary conserved proteins among all multicellular life. Plants, animals or fungi that attempt reproduction with a small random mutation that changes the histone protein will not survive — probably not past the first cell’s division.”

Berenson said that histones play a key role in processing genetic material. “When histones are more widely separated, cells will process, or transcribe DNA more actively — potentially leading to tumor growth.”

The researchers identified a change called “histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation” (H3K27ac), and observed “Persistent epigenetic memory of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in monocyte-derivedmacrophages.”

According to Berenson, this alteration “is known to be found in several different types of cancer and has attracted increasingscientific attention.”

The study found that the H3K27ac changes occurred across multiple chromosomal regions and were found to persist for many months after vaccination. According to the researchers, this suggests that similar alterations are occurring inmonocytes— a type of white blood cell that produces macrophages.

The findings mirror the outcomes of other recent peer-reviewed studies that have examined H3K27ac alterations. A Chinese study published in February found that H3K27ac has “emerging potential as atherapeutic target in cancer.”

A Polish study last year found that H3K27ac alterations were associated with cancers such as leukemia andgliomas, or brain tumors.

Study results strengthen calls to suspend or withdraw mRNA vaccines

The study was accompanied by a published discussion withoutside reviewers, in which the researchers said that the alterations they identified are likely also occurring in bone marrow cells — from whichleukemia can originate.

Berenson suggested that this may account for rising leukemia diagnoses in countries like Japan, with a high rate of mRNA vaccination.

“Leukemia is essentially a cancer of stem cells, and Japanese researchers have found astatistically significant increase in leukemiain Japan in 2022 and 2023. Japan relied almost exclusively on mRNA jabs against Covid, and nearly every adult received both the initial two-shot regimen and a booster,”Berenson wrote.

Last year, Japan became the first — and so far only — country to approve a self-amplifying mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Berenson said the researchers avoided making a connection between the mRNA vaccines and bone marrow alterations in the published paper itself for unclear reasons.

The paper’s authors did not respond to a request for comment.

Jablonowski said it was “painful” to read the paper “because of their conviction and arrogance that histone modification only had an upside.”

“It was the result of a vaccine and, in the authors’ eyes, could do no wrong,” Jablonowski said. “Unintended reprogramming ofprogenitor cells” — cells with the ability to differentiate into different cell types, including stem cells — “is not to be lauded, it is to be feared.” He added:

“With every advancement in knowledge of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, we are again reminded of our own complacency about the blinded rush to push these products into every American.

“With the revelation of epigenetic reprogramming of progenitor cells, quite capable of causing disease, would the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] so blindly approve mRNA products, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] so blindly recommend them and politicians so blindly mandate them?”

Rose said the study’s findings strengthen growing calls by scientists to suspend or ban mRNA vaccines.

A petition before the FDA, filed earlier this year by a group of scientists, calls for the suspension or withdrawal of the mRNA COVID-19 shots. The petition cites evidence that the products are unapproved gene therapies and contaminated with DNA plasmids.

Several recent studies have also questioned the safety of the mRNA shots.

A2023 preprint studydetected levels of synthetic DNA in the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 shots 18 to 70 times aboveregulatory limits.

A December 2024peer-reviewed studysupervised by FDA scientists detected synthetic DNA contamination levels in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that were 6 to 470 times above regulatory limits.

Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the creation of a sub-agency within the CDC that will focus on vaccine injuries.

Actor John Boyega Says ‘White Supremacy’ Is to Blame for Star Wars’ Terrible Ratings,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/actor-john-boyega-says-white-supremacy-is-to-blame-for-star-wars-terrible-ratings/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 3, 2025","Actor John Boyega has slammed Star Wars fans, pinning the franchise’s terrible ratings on “White Supremacy.” In a bold claim, the black actor insists that resistance to diverse heroes, like his character, reflects deep-seated racial bias among viewers, tanking the series’ appeal.



In the Apple TV+ documentaryNumber One on the Call Sheet, Boyega, known for portraying a former Storm Trooper in the trilogy beginning with 2015’sStar Wars: The Force Awakens, doubles down on his stance. He argues that fans’ unease with black characters in leading roles has fueled backlash against the sci-fi saga, pointing to a broader reluctance to embrace diversity in the iconic franchise.

“Let me tell you, Star Wars always had the vibe of being in the most whitest, elite space,” Boyega declared.

Star Wars actor John Boyega attacks fans of the franchise as racist white elitistspic.twitter.com/s9zxszFwiR

“This is a franchise that’s so white that it’s like a black person existing in that was something,” he added.

Infowars.comreports: The actor went on to claim pivotal characters likeThe Empire Strikes Back‘s Lando Calrissian were mere side characters or afterthoughts.

“And you can always tell it’s something when some Star Wars fans try to say, ‘Well, you know, we had Lando Calrissian and had Samuel L. Jackson.’ That’s like telling me how many cookie chips are on the cookie dough. I’m like, ‘They just scattered that in there, bro!’”

Boyega went on to say Hollywood also kept black actors from main hero roles, saying, “They’re OK with us playing the best friend, but once we touch their heroes, once we lead, once we trailblaze, it’s like, ‘Oh my God, it’s just a bit too much. They’re pandering!’”

Elsewhere in his comments, BoyegaaccusedDisney of marketing his character as important, despite giving him an unimportant role.

“What I would say to Disney is do not bring out a Black character, market them to be much more important in the franchise than they are and then have them pushed to the side,” Boyega said in the documentary. “It’s not good. I’ll say it straight up.”

Footage from a 1983 premier ofStar Wars: Return of the Jediillustrates how the franchise’s fan base is actually much more diverse than Boyega realizes, effectively rendering his comments on their racism moot.

Gee, look at all that fan DIVERSITY, way back in 1983…Hey John Boyega, it's NOT the fans that are the problem.https://t.co/TJCWqd0Z8Ppic.twitter.com/r3sdTksxBc

In an interview with Fox NewsTurner explained that she had no intention of taking on ‘a man’ and therefore chose to remove herself from the match

Fans have branding the competition ‘tainted and unfair’ and tennis legend Martina Navratilova has ripped USA Fencing for punishing a female fencer at the tournament in Maryland last weekeND.

“This is what happens when female athletes protest! Anyone here still thinks this is fair??? I am fuming… and shame on @USAFencing, shame on you for doing this. How dare you throw women under the gender bulls— bus!!!” Navratilova wrote on X.

TheMail Onlinereports: Turner had completed four matches before facing Sullivan, who eventually came 24th out of 39 in the tournament.

After the controversial incident, fans have taken to social media to blast USA fencing for disqualifying a female competitor and allowing a transgender athlete to take part.

One user posted on X: ‘You allow biological men to compete with women thus stripping women from reaching their dreams. Shame on you!’

‘Why are you disqualifying women and not the transgenders invading women’s sports,’ asked another.

‘Shame on every single one of you who allow men to compete with women. SHAME,’ wrote a third.

A fourth said: ‘Your organization and your people doing this to women and girls is an embarrassment. Go f*** yourselves’.

While one simply commented: ‘Your women’s competition is tainted and unfair.’

Tennis legend Martina Navratilova, who has frequently spoken out against transgender women competing in female sport in recent years, also weighed in on the controversy by saying: ‘And again….’

Biden’s Ex-Chief of Staff Opens Up About The Former President’s Mental Decline,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/bidens-ex-chief-of-staff-opens-up-about-the-former-presidents-mental-decline/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 3, 2025","Joe Biden’s former chief of staff has spilled the beans on what most of us already knew regarding sleepy Joe’s mental decline.



Ron Klain, who was Biden’s White House Chief of Staff from 2021 to 2023 and who later returned to help him with debate preparation in 2024, is quoted in an upcoming book saying that the president had no idea what was really going on.

He said that Biden couldn’t grasp basic concepts, fell asleep in debate prep and thought he was the leader of NATO

TGPreports:AccordingtoThe Guardian,Klain claimed that Biden “didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was.”

During debate preparation, Biden reportedly left and fell asleep by the pool.

At one point, Biden had a brainwave.

“If he looked perplexed when Trump talked, voters would understand that Trump was an idiot,” the book states.

”Klain replied: ‘Sir, when you look perplexed, people just think you’re perplexed. And this is our problem in this race.’”

The claims were made in reporter Chris Whipple’s upcoming book,Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History.

In another part of the book, Whittle says that Klain even wondered whether Biden thought he was the president of NATO rather than the United States:

At his first meeting with Biden in Aspen Lodge, the president’s cabin, Klain was startled. He’d never seen him so exhausted and out of it. Biden was unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. Halfway through the session, the president excused himself and went off to sit by the pool.

That evening Biden met again with Klain and his team, [Biden aides] Mike Donilon, Steve Richetti, and Bruce Reed. ‘We sat around the table,’ said Klain. ‘[Biden] had answers on cards, and he was just extremely exhausted.

And I was struck by how out of touch with American politics he was. He was just very, very focused on his interactions with Nato leaders.’

Klain wondered half-seriously if Biden thought he was president of Nato instead of the US. ‘He just became very enraptured with being the head of Nato,’ he said. That wouldn’t help him on Capitol Hill because, as Klain noted, ‘domestic political leaders don’t really care what [Emmanuel] Macron and [Olaf] Scholz think.’

Whittle, meanwhile, believes that calling the behavior of Biden’s staff a “cover-up” is too simplistic.

“I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic,” he said in arecent interviewwith Politico. “I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that.”

“Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial,” he added. “They believed what they wanted to believe.”

In his latest annual letter, Fink emphasized that the U.S. faces significant economic challenges, particularly concerning its growing national debt.

He stated that if the U.S. continues on its fiscal trajectory, Bitcoin will emerge as a viable alternative to the dollar.

Fink’sconcernscenter around the increasing U.S. national debt, which has surpassed 100% of the country’s GDP.

He warned that if this trend continues, it could lead to a situation where the U.S. struggles to maintain its global financial position.

Considering that the interest on the national debt is projected to be more than $952 billion this year, the fiscal pressure may intensify and cause potential significant impacts.

Fink noted that if current trends continue, the federal government of the United States will have a permanent deficit by 2030, whereby all federal revenue would be directed to debt servicing.

If these issues persist, then confidence in the U.S. dollar is likely to decrease. He said that, since this year, presumably Bitcoin or other digital assets could be considered less risky and offer an opportunity to get rid of the risk associated with assets in U.S. dollars.

This statement comes amid criticism of Bitcoin’s status as digital gold by Peter Schiff due to recent price decline and volatility.

Fink also pointed out that the fact that Bitcoin is free from the control of the conventional institutions and accepts it in exchange for goods and services make it very attractive to investors especially during inflationary times.

According to Russia’s deputy UN envoy Dmitry Polyansky, Zelensky is playing a“dangerous game”with US President Donald Trump by accusing Moscow of trying to torpedo the peace process,

He said it is Kiev, not Moscow, that keeps violating the Washington-brokered truce on strikes against energy infrastructure.

RTreports: Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Wednesday that Ukraine has been targeting its energy infrastructure on a daily basis despite Moscow and Washington announcing a 30-day pause on such attacks on March 18 and Kiev saying that it supports the initiative.

However, Zelensky had earlier blamed Russia for violating the truce, claiming that Moscow is“mocking”the peace efforts and looking to stretch out the conflict. During his interview with RT on Thursday, Polyansky said that“denial and false claims”are the Ukrainian leader’s“favorite tactics.”

The envoy insisted that it has been“clearly proven by the evidence that he is not right; that his claims are false,”adding that Russia has provided the US with extensive proof of Kiev’s repeated violations of the truce.

“Zelensky on a daily basis breaches this agreement and pretends that it is Russia, which is doing this, but I think that Americans have facts in their hands and they have the technical possibility to see what is really happening,”he mused.

“So this is a dangerous game that he is trying to play with the Trump administration, but it is up to him, of course. [Zelensky] is an actor; he is into playing games,”Polyansky stated.

Zelensky, who remains in power despite his term in office officially expiring last May,“does not want any peace effort to succeed because this will mean that he will have to hold elections and to lose power, eventually. And also that he has a lot of chances to be held accountable for what he did and for the money that he has stolen from the Western aid,”he said.

Moscow is observing the truce on strikes against energy infrastructure, and the authorities in Washington“understand that it is the Kiev regime which is not forthcoming, whereas Russia is trying to be as helpful as possible,”the envoy stressed.

“The road to peace would not be easy,”but Russia remains committed to finding a diplomatic solution, Polyansky stressed. He reiterated Moscow’s stance that in order for peace to be“sustainable and lasting”the root causes of the conflict should be addressed.

The charges accuse Van Damme of having obtained five Romanian women as a “gift” in Cannes, France while knowing they were trafficked by an alleged criminal group led by Morel Bolea.

Attorney Adrian Cuculis, a representative of one of the allegedly trafficked women, issued a statement about the allegations made against the famous “Universal Soldier” and “Kickboxer” actor.

AOLreport: An individual claiming to have witnessed alleged incident said it occurred at an event organized by Van Damme in Cannes and told authorities, which prompted the DIICOT to open a criminal investigation, according to Antena 3.

“We are discussing an outrageous case that is not new for the Prosecutor’s Offices in Romania. From the statements given in a case of trafficking in minors and human trafficking that started with the investigations since 2020, one of the victims … told prosecutors in Iasi how at a certain point in Cannes, at an event organized by Jean-Claude Van Damme, several Romanians who are currently being investigated for forming a criminal group and pimping, allegedly offered Jean-Claude Van Damme five Romanian women — photo models in Romania — for him to have sexual relations with,”Cuculis said, according to the translated article.

“The person who received those benefits knew their condition. From the witness statements, it is very clear that Jean-Claude Van Damme knew that these people were being exploited,”he alleged.

The Prosecutor General of the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice must agree to the beginning of criminal proceedings because the alleged actions took place in Cannes, located in France, Antena 3 reported. This office is the highest prosecutorial authority in Romania,according toThomson Reuters Practical Law.

The allegations have not been publicly addressed by the 64-year-old Hollywood star.

Van Damme has secured more than 80 movie credits to his name over the course of his five-decades long career in film.

Marine Le Pen Vows to Fight ‘New World Order’ After Presidential Ban,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/marine-le-pen-vows-to-fight-new-world-order-after-presidential-ban/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 2, 2025","Marine Le Pen has pledged to wage war against a ‘New World Order’ she claims orchestrated her ban from France’s presidential race, vowing to defy a Paris court ruling issued on Monday, March 31. The National Rally leader denounced the decision as a blatant disenfranchisement of millions of voters, casting it as a strike by global elites against French sovereignty.



In her first public statement since the verdict, Le Pen refused to bow out of politics, instead rallying her supporters with a fiery rebuke. “Let’s be clear: I have been excluded, but in reality, it is millions of French people whose voices have been silenced,” she declared. She framed the ban—rooted in prior legal battles—as proof of a coordinated effort by powerful forces to suppress her anti-establishment movement.

The ruling has only deepened Le Pen’s resolve, turning a personal setback into a broader call to arms for her base. By invoking the ‘New World Order,’ she taps into long-standing conspiracy narratives, accusing the judiciary of serving an international agenda over the will of the people. As France grapples with this political flashpoint, Le Pen’s next steps could reshape the nation’s right-wing landscape.

Le Pen was found guilty of embezzlement and banned from running in elections for five years, with the ruling taking immediate effect.

In an interview with the French television channelTF1, Le Pen clammed the verdict, calling it a “political decision” and claiming that the rule of law had been “completely violated.”

“Millions of French citizens are outraged. In France, the country of human rights, judges are enforcing the laws of an authoritarian regime,” Le Pen said, calling it a “tragic day for our democracy.”

Iran Threatens Nuclear Arms Race as World War III Fears Escalate,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/iran-threatens-nuclear-arms-race-as-world-war-iii-fears-escalate/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 2, 2025","Iran has ignited global alarm by threatening to pursue nuclear weapons, escalating fears of a World War III arms race. On Monday, lawmaker Ahmad Naderi pointed to North Korea as a blueprint, claiming a nuclear arsenal would shield Tehran from U.S. aggression—a bold shift in rhetoric that amplifies tensions amid stalled talks and warnings of American retaliation.



Naderi, a key figure in Iran’s Parliament Presidium, made the case just days after former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened devastating airstrikes if Iran rejects a new nuclear deal. The remarks peel back decades of Tehran’s insistence that its nuclear program is peaceful, exposing what critics call the regime’s true ambitions. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has doubled down, vowing swift reprisals against any U.S. attack, as Iran’s provocative stance risks plunging the region—and the world—into deeper conflict.

Naturalnews.comreports:The brazen suggestion from Naderi, paired with Khamenei’s threats, reinforces concerns that Iran’s leadership views nuclear weapons as leverage rather than a red line. With Tehran rejecting direct talks and doubling down on uranium enrichment, the regime appears to be testing Washington’s resolve, betting that nuclear brinkmanship will extract concessions rather than invite further isolation.

Naderi’s comments, posted on X, were explicit: “Observing Trump’s behavior and speech during his first term with North Korea shows that having a nuclear weapon has brought security to Korea.” He added, “For a long time, many elites and sympathizers of the country and the [Islamic] Revolution have been calling for the bomb to be tested and announced. If we were also armed with nuclear weapons, Trump would not dare to threaten bombing.”

The comparison to North Korea is particularly alarming. Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal has shielded it from direct military confrontation, even as it continues missile tests and aggressive posturing. Naderi’s argument suggests Iran’s hardliners see nuclear weapons as the ultimate deterrent — a stance that directly contradicts Tehran’s official insistence that its nuclear ambitions are solely for energy production.

Trump’s recent threats — “It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before” — were met with defiance from Iran’s leadership.Khamenei warnedMonday that any U.S. attack would be met with “a strong reciprocal blow,” while Ali Larijani, a top adviser to the Supreme Leader, declared that an American strike would “force Iran to move towards [nuclear weapons] because it has to defend itself.”

Iran’s rejection of direct negotiations despite Trump’s offer of talks reveals a regime that responds only to perceived strength. After the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and reimposed sanctions, Iran systematically violated the agreement’s limits on uranium enrichment. Now, with enrichment levels far exceeding JCPOA restrictions, Tehran is openly flouting international concerns while demanding sanctions relief.

Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei framed Trump’s threats as “a shocking affront to the very essence of international peace and security,” yet Iran’s own actions — including proxy warfare, ballistic missile development, and now nuclear posturing — demonstrate a pattern of destabilization.

The regime’s insistence on “indirect” negotiations routed through Oman further highlights its unwillingness to engage in good faith. President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed that Khamenei had permitted backchannel talks but ruled out direct dialogue “under maximum pressure and the threat of military action.”

Western intelligence agencies have long accused Iran of pursuing nuclear weapons capability under the guise of civilian energy needs. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has repeatedly flagged undeclared nuclear sites, while uranium enriched to near-weapons-grade levels raises undeniable proliferation risks. Naderi’s remarks only validate these fears.

Iran’s latest rhetoric is a calculated gamble that assumes nuclear threats will force concessions rather than invite harsher measures. The regime’s playbook mirrors North Korea’s: escalate tensions, demand sanctions relief, and exploit diplomatic divisions. But unlike Pyongyang, Iran remains years away from a functional nuclear weapon—a window that may soon close if the West fails to respond decisively.

The choice for the international community is clear. Either accept Iran’s nuclear ambitions as inevitable—rewarding decades of deception—or confront the regime with unrelenting pressure before it’s too late. As Khamenei and his allies make their intentions unmistakably clear, the world can no longer afford to look away.

Putin Launches Russia’s Largest-Ever Military Draft Amid World War III Preparations,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/putin-launches-russias-largest-ever-military-draft-amid-world-war-iii-preparations/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 2, 2025","Russian President Vladimir Putin has unleashed the largest military draft in Russia’s history, calling up 160,000 young men as tensions with Ukraine spiral and fears of World War III loom.

Theordertargets men aged 18 to 30, with recruitment running from April to July 2025, as Russia seeks to fortify its military for an escalating war effort.

DCNFreports: “If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault — which it might not be — but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump told NBC News.

Grady, a nurse-bioethicist with decades of experience, was a key figure in shaping“ethical frameworks”for clinical research, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Her dismissal follows Kennedy’s vocal criticism of Fauci’s tenure and promises to overhaul federal health agencies. Sources say Grady has been offered a lesser role at the Indian Health Service, though she has not commented publicly.

BREAKING:Fauci’s wife has been FIRED from the NIH.pic.twitter.com/qMe7vM6I3S

The firing comes amid Kennedy’s broader purge of NIH leadership, targeting what he calls a “corrupt” establishment, asGenetic Engineering and Biotechnology Newsreports:

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has begun eliminating some 10,000 jobs as announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—a staggering shrinkage of the department’s workforce and consolidation of programs that some former officials and others warned would decimate U.S. life sciences activity, from academic research to industry drug development and regulation to public health oversight.

The 10,000 jobs being eliminated include 3,500 positions at the FDA, 2,400 at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and 1,200 at the NIH. Another 300 positions will also be eliminated at the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

HHS has said the job cuts and its restructuring of operations will save $1.8 billion a year, eliminate bureaucracy and waste, and enhance the agencies’ ability to conduct essential functions.

According to army plans a 5,000-strong armored brigade in Lithuania is set to be combat-ready by 2027.

The 45th Armored Brigade is being positioned in Lithuania, near Russian ally Belarus, as Berlin prepares for a potential conflict in the coming years.

RTreports: On Tuesday, a ceremony was held outside Vilnius, with Brigadier General Christoph Huber assuming command of the newly established unit, as reported by the German Bundeswehr Association (DBwV) lobby group and state media.

”We have a clear mission. We have to ensure the protection, freedom, and security of our Lithuanian allies here on NATO’s eastern flank,”the general said during the ceremony.

Military personnel who arrived in Lithuania last year topreparefor the deployment have been formally integrated into the brigade. Once fully staffed and combat-ready by 2027, the unit will comprise approximately 5,000 military and civilian personnel, equipped with around 2,000 heavy weapons, according to German Army plans.

Moscow views NATO as a hostile entity, describing its expansion in Europe as a direct threat to Russian national security. The bloc’s pledge to admit Ukraine as a member and its increasing involvement with the nation have been cited by Russian officials as key causes of Moscow’s conflict with Kiev. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, a staunch advocate for troop deployment in Lithuania, has claimed that Russia could launch an attack on NATO by 2029 or 2030 – a claim that Moscow categorically rejects.

In 2023, Berlin and Vilniussigneda stationing agreement, initially designating the new German unit as the 42nd Brigade. Two of its battalions will consist exclusively of German soldiers, while the third will incorporate personnel from other NATO countries. Portions of the brigade will be stationed at the Rudninkai training ground in southeastern Lithuania, only 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Belarusian border, while additional units will be stationed near the village of Rukla between Vilnius and Kaunas.

Post-Nazi Germany previously restricted military deployments abroad to temporary assignments, such as contributing to NATO forces following the occupation of Afghanistan in 2001.

Security Secretary Dan Jarvis told the UK parliament that individuals“carrying out an activity under an agreement”with certain Russian state institutions will be required to register under the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS) which is expected to take effect by July 1st.

RTreports: The measure, which already includes individuals working on behalf of Iran, is described by officials as a national security tool aimed at combating malign foreign interference. Russia is now being placed under the scheme’s most stringent category.

“Russia represents a serious threat to national security,”Jarvis told MPs.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy, in a government press release, said that Moscow has“pursued an increasingly hostile policy towards the United Kingdom and its interests”in recent years. He cited harassment of diplomats, cyber operations, and alleged attempts to recruit spies to commit sabotage on British soil.

Under the new system, individuals linked to multiple branches of the Russian state – including the president, parliament, all ministries and their agencies, intelligence services, armed forces, police, judiciary, and political parties will be required to declare their activities in the UK.

The measure follows an earlier decision in March to classify Iran’s government, intelligence services, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps under the highest level of FIRS scrutiny.

The British government has stated that failure to comply with registration requirements could result in criminal prosecution and a prison sentence.

Theoperation, led by Europol, involved law enforcement from more than 30 countries including the US. So far, 79 individuals have been arrested, with 1,400 suspects identified globally, according to the German news agency dpa.

#BREAKINGInvestigators from more than 30 countries have dismantled a huge paedophile network with almost 2 million users worldwide and detained 79 people, the EU police agency Europol sayspic.twitter.com/fHGdEYglJx

Among those detained, 79 are suspected not only of viewing or downloading the illicit material but also of directly abusing children.

This crackdown shines a harsh light on a broader crisis. Each year, an estimated 8 million children vanish worldwide, fueling a child trafficking epidemic that experts call a multi-billion-dollar industry.

Platforms like KidFlix serve as digital hubs for this trade, exploiting the countless minors who disappear annually—many never to be found.

“Some attempt to frame this as merely a technical or cyber issue – but it is not,”saidEuropol Executive Director Catherine De Bolle, explaining that the ringleaders had been hiding in plain sight.

“There are real victims behind these crimes, and those victims are children. As a society, we must act to protect our children.”

The sheer scale of the massive network underscores the pervasive threat of trafficking, which preys on vulnerable populations and feeds a shadowy market often linked to the powerful and wealthy.

Investigators seized servers and digital evidence to dismantle the platform, but the arrests represent only a fraction of the battle.

With millions of children still unaccounted for and trafficking networks thriving, questions linger about the scope of this underground economy.

Europol vows to press forward, but the operation raises an urgent challenge: how deep does this web truly run?

Some of Gavi’s flagship vaccine programmes will have to be cut if the United States goes through witha plan to stop funding the global partnership, its CEO has warned.

Among the projects under threat are plans to begin building emergency stockpiles of new mpox andtuberculosis vaccines, the distribution ofbadly needed malaria jabs, as well as a billion dollar programme to boost vaccine production in Africa.

Dr Sania Nishtar, who took over as CEO of the organisation in March last year, said the Gavi board would have to decide “what gets shelved” in the event American funding dries up.

“If we take a 15 per cent cut, and if this comes on the top of the cuts that the traditional donors may make, we have to go to the drawing board on what gets dropped, what gets scaled down,” she told The Telegraph.

“We’ve just introduced the malaria vaccine and then, of course, the tuberculosis vaccine is on the anvil,” she said. “There is already a commitment to maintain a new stockpile for the mpox vaccine. So all these things will be up for debate, as would be the African Vaccine Manufacturing accelerator.”

The Trump administration’s decision to end support for Gavi, which helps purchase vaccines for the world’s poorest countries and has been credited with saving the lives of 19 million children, was revealed in a spreadsheet sent to Congress last week.

The US has been one of the organisation’s biggest donors since it was set up at the turn of the millennium, and Dr Nishtar said she was optimistic that Washington can be persuaded to continue its support.

“I must emphasise that we have not received a termination notice,” she said. “We think that the situation will be remedied and we will not have to live with this funding shortfall.

Mass graves. Shallow pits filled with the broken bodies of children, their fragile frames marked by the unmistakable scars of adrenochroming—ritual cuts, hollowed eyes, and signs of torment no human should endure.

Even the hardened soldiers of Putin’s elite crew found themselves retching at the sight. One taskforce member called it ‘a slaughterhouse for innocence,’ and the videos they smuggled out?

We have to warn you in advance: they are not for the faint of heart.

But the story doesn’t end in the blood-soaked killing fields of backwoods Ukraine. It stretches far beyond Europe, across oceans and borders, to a frozen enigma: Greenland.

Stick with us—because what the Russians are now saying is buried under the ice could bring the elites’ whole house of cards crashing down.

This week, the mainstream media kicked into overdrive, churning out bold-faced fake news and propaganda. Their latest narrative? Convincing the world that Putin and Russia are on the brink ofdeclaring waron the U.S. over—wait for it—Greenland.

But over in the Kremlin, sources say they were laughing at these fake news stories. In fact, the real story was quite the opposite: Putin’s been quietly cheering Trump on, encouraging him to stake a claim on Greenland for the U.S.

Why? Putin believes in peace through strength. And a strong US is essential to world peace. There are other reasons too, more complicated and disturbing reasons, which we will get to in a moment.

Then, on Friday, Putin dropped a bombshell that left the U.S. media scrambling. He gave a speech and publicly threw his full support behind Trump’s push to bring Greenland into the American fold, shattering the fearmongering tales spun by the mainstream press in one swift move.

Of course, the mainstream media isstill missing the point.

Russian intel claims it’s no coincidence. They say Greenland’s sprawling, desolate shores are not just a source of critical minerals and a jumping off point for emerging trade routes to the north.

They also hide the nerve center of a global child trafficking hub—a shadowy relay point funneling victims from Europe’s darkest corners to the glittering elite playgrounds of Washington, D.C., and Hollywood.

As far as Putin is concerned, Greenland—part of the world’s last untamed frontier, a rugged remnant of the wild west—must be brought to heel.

Putin’s response comes as no surprise when you think about what unfolds in the world’s untamed frontiers.

Consider the most lucrative enterprises on the planet—the kind thriving in the lawless backwoods of Ukraine. We are talking about child trafficking, which has now claimed the title of the world’s most profitable criminal trade. By a staggering margin.

And Putin is at the forefront of the fight against this evil trade.

Russian troops, alongside operatives from Putin’s Adrenochrome Task Force, have unearthed nightmarish scenes in recent days: sprawling mass graves filled with the broken bodies of children, their pallid skin marked by the unmistakable scars of blood harvesting and ritualistic torment.

The air hangs heavy with the stench of death, a grim testament to an operation that’s allegedly spiraled beyond control.

Make no mistake, the perpetrators of these crimes are desperate to keep this information under wraps.

Soldiers of the Russian special forces unit “Akhmat” and the war reporter Patrick Lancaster were targeted by drone, with the American shocked that despite the#PRESSAsign clearly identifying him as a journalist, the Ukrainian drone was trying to silence him for good too.

They are desperate to stop this information from making it out. Reports from the frontlines reveal a grisly trade flooding the black market: leather boots crafted from the flayed skin of these young victims.

In Western circles, collectors with deep pockets—some say depraved elites—are shelling out tens of thousands for a pair.

The most coveted? Boots stitched from the delicate, unblemished faces of children, with prices soaring past six figures for the finest craftsmanship. Each step taken in these boots represents a sickening echo of stolen lives.

And then there’s the soap. Rendered from the fat of the slain, these bars are fetching obscene sums among VIPs in Europe and the U.S.

Creamy, pale, and faintly scented with something unplaceable, they’ve become the ultimate status symbol for the bathrooms of the powerful—a twisted luxury born from unimaginable cruelty.

The elite, it’s whispered, now wash their hands in the essence of innocence, as if to cleanse their own sins.

Recent breakthroughs in Ukraine, led by Putin’s Adrenochrome Taskforce, have brought us closer than ever to dismantling the horrific trade in children’s bodies once and for all.

A soldier from the taskforce reports that major supply chains have been disrupted, and efforts are underway to shut down critical supply routes, including Greenland.

For decades, the elite have concealed their twisted indulgences right under our noses, flaunting their secrets in plain sight.

Whispers of the ‘Red Shoe Club’ hint at a grotesque two-for-one bargain.

It starts with ‘Eyes Without a Face’—a chilling reference to harvesting pineal glands and extracting adrenochrome, the dark currency of their depravity.

From there, the remains are tanned into leather, crafted into the blood-red shoes that mark their exclusive circle.

And who’s at the center of this macabre scene? None other than the Podestas, America’s foremost collectors of degenerate art, and the shadowy figures who wielded influence in the White House during Biden’s tenure.

The information is staring us all the face. Despite mainstream media misinformation, Ukraine has emerged as a key player in the child trafficking network.

As former CIA analyst Larry Johnson told Judge Napolitano, Ukraine has been a hotbed of corruption and pedophilia for decades and the main globalist interest in Ukraine is child trafficking.

Johnson is a seasoned analyst who knows Ukraine better than anybody in the mainstream media and following Trump’s election victory, his expert analysis is playing out exactly as predicted.

According to those on the ground, a private jet was seized near the border of the Russian Kursk region in late March, with dozens of traumatized children being held against their will in atrocious conditions.

Thanks to Putin’s adrenochrome task force, all bets are off and the pedophile elite are running scared.

But be warned, speaking the truth about the elite is a dangerous game, as Hollywood actor Jim Caviezel found out when he shared what he knows about adrenochrome and the entertainment industry.

If you want to live in a world that is safe for our children, it’s time to choose a side and make a stand.

Are you on the side of the Hollywood entertainment system that corrupts and abuses children and the mainstream media that covers up the crimes of abusers in positions of power?

Or are you on the side of the brave truth tellers seen in this video who are determined to make the world a better place for our children?

Israel Vows ‘Large-Scale Attack on Iran’ Within 24 Hours,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/israel-vows-large-scale-attack-on-iran-within-24-hours/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 1, 2025","Israel has vowed a ‘large-scale attack on Iran’ within the next 24 hours, with its war cabinet greenlighting the strike tonight, according to Israel’s Channel 14, Hebrew Channel 14, and state television. This dramatic escalation promises a fierce response to Tehran’s provocations, signaling a perilous new chapter in the simmering conflict between the two nations.



The decision emerged from a tense war cabinet meeting, widely reported as a pivotal moment amid rising fears of Iranian aggression against Israeli interests. Sources suggest Iran may have been plotting an attack, pushing Israel to act preemptively. Confirmation from multiple outlets underscores the gravity of the move, with preparations now underway for what could be a devastating blow to Tehran’s military capabilities.

🇺🇸🇮🇱🇮🇷  A large-scale attack on Iran will begin soon, an unprecedented assault since World War II.— Israeli Channel 14

Channel 14: A large-scale attack on Iran will begin soon, and it will be ""a strike unprecedented since World War II.""https://t.co/YgKQay4KNz

Across the globe, Moscow has slammed a parallel U.S. stance, condemning former President Trump’s threat to bomb Iran if it rejects a new nuclear deal. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov labeled Trump’s words an “unacceptable ultimatum,” warning that strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites would unleash chaos across the Middle East. Russia’s plea for de-escalation stands in stark contrast to Israel’s resolve, highlighting a fractured international response to the crisis.

Trump, undeterred, doubled down, promising “unprecedented bombing” and crippling sanctions should Tehran refuse negotiations. Iran’s swift dismissal of talks only fueled his rhetoric, with the ex-president vowing a bombardment “the likes of which they have never seen.” As Israel gears up for its imminent assault and global powers jostle over diplomacy, the region teeters on the edge of a conflict that could redraw the geopolitical map.

Jenny McCarthy Claims Democrats Attempted to ‘Destroy Her’ Over Vaccine-Autism Link,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/jenny-mccarthy-claims-democrats-attempted-to-destroy-her-over-vaccine-autism-link/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"April 1, 2025","Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg has accused Democrats of orchestrating a sinister campaign to “destroy her” after she connected vaccines to autism, alleging a federal government entity enlisted a PR firm to tarnish her reputation. The actress and model claims this smear was a calculated move to silence her controversial stance.



In a revealing interview on the “Heal Squad” podcast last week, McCarthy recounted how an insider from the PR firm tipped her off about the plot. According to her, “a government agency” sought to paint her as an unhinged “anti-vaccine” figure, crafting a false narrative to discredit her claims. The revelation reignites debate over her long-standing advocacy and the lengths to which power players might go to suppress dissenting voices.

“Someone came to me in person and said, ‘I basically am a PR agent, a very high echelon one. And I was approached by a government agency to create a narrative against you. And it’s going to be called: you’re anti-vaccine,’” recounted McCarthy, who supported Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s 2024 presidential campaign.

🚨 Jenny McCarthy Says the Government Hired a PR Firm to Smear Her For Talking About Vaccines & Autism“Someone came to me in person and said I am a PR agency, a very high echelon one, and I was approached by a government agency to create a narrative against you and it's going…pic.twitter.com/NJ0u9zmBju

Infowars.comreports: McCarthy continued: “‘And I turned down the job, but I wanted to privately and secretly tell you this.So we couldn’t do an email, we couldn’t do a phone call. I had to come to you in person and let you know this, that they’re going to come after you…and hard.’”

The former Playboy model argued to the PR agent that she wasn’t “anti-vax,” but merely speaking up after her son was injured by a vaccine.

“Doesn’t matter,” the unnamed person told McCarthy. “They’re going to come after you with everything they’ve got. And they’ve, you know, they’ve got the media on their side,’” they said, adding the conversation was just a “heads up.”

McCarthy, who waspreviously married to actor Jim Carrey, noted she “didn’t get scared” because she had faith and truth in her corner, but soon realized she was being dropped from gigs.

“So when it started happening, it didn’t really hurt me until it started taking jobs away from me,” McCarthy said, adding, “I was the beginning of kind of that cancel culture…’cancel culture’ wasn’t even a phrase yet.”

“But I would get calls from certain jobs and they’d be like, ‘We’re taking you off this campaign.’ So it was, that was the hard part because I was a single mom.”

In another part of the interview, McCarthy said she was now on a carnivore diet after a vegan diet nearly killed her, saying, “I tried vegan and I almost died. I became so ill. I was exhausted and fatigued. I was a mess.”

Biological Males Banned From Women’s Sports & Bathrooms In Montana,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/biological-males-banned-from-womens-sports-bathrooms-in-montana/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 1, 2025","Last week Montana Governor Greg Gianforte signed two bills into law which aim to protect women and girls’ privacy, safety, and athletic opportunities.



The new law requires public buildings including the state Capitol, schools, jails, prisons, libraries and state-funded shelters to provide separate spaces for men and women

It also declares that there are only two sexes, male and female, going against a judge’s 2024 ruling that struck down that same definition.

LifeSiteNewsreports: The first bill,HB 121, prohibits men from entering women’s spaces like changing rooms, sleeping quarters, and restrooms. It also requires public schools, correctional facilities, public buildings, and domestic violence shelters to safeguard women’s safety and privacy.

The second bill,HB 300, strengthens protections for female athletes of all ages, ensuring they are not forced to share intimate spaces with males or compete against males on their sports teams.

“Montana is right to protect the privacy, safety, and dignity of women and girls, and to ensure that female athletes of all ages continue to have a fair and level playing field,” said ADF Senior Counsel Matt Sharp, director of the ADF Center for Public Policy.

“Letting men intrude into women’s spaces and on their sports teams is an invasion of privacy, a threat to their safety, and a denial of the real biological differences between the sexes. ADF commends Rep. Kerri Seekins-Crowe, Sen. John Fuller, Sen. Sue Vinton, Speaker Brandon Ler, and Senate President Matt Regier for their leadership in passing these critical bills. We also thank the Independent Women’s Voice and the Montana Family Foundation for their work in this effort. By signing this legislation into law, Gov. Gianforte is protecting Montanans for generations to come.”

Toddler Suspended From UK Nursery For Being ‘Transphobic’,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/toddler-suspended-from-uk-nursery-for-being-transphobic/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 1, 2025","A toddler was kicked out of a UK nursery school after being accused of being transphobic or homophobic, according to local media reports.



The Telegraph reported that according to data for the Department of Education obtained through a freedom of information request, the toddler was suspended from a UK state school for “abuse against sexual orientation and gender identity.”

Yes, you read that correctly, a three or four year old child was kicked out of school for anti-LGBT bigotry.

The incident happened during the 2022/2023 academic term and it would appear that it is not an isolated case.

This is totalitarian insanity. If you think small children should be punished for being able to recognise sex, you are a dangerous zealot who should be nowhere near kids or in any position of authority over them.https://t.co/IZI0sP58ss

LifeSiteNewsreports: Understandably, the unnamed school in question did not provide any further details of the toddler’s suspension, but theIndependentnotedthat “data does show 94 pupils at state primary schools were suspended or permanently excluded for homophobia or transphobia in 2022/23,” and “ten of the suspended pupils were from year one and three were from year two where the maximum age is seven.”

According to the Department of Education data, 82 pupils were suspended for the same reason in the fall term of 2023. According to theIndependent: “The data, which has only been collected since the 2020/21 academic year, also showed the number of pupils suspended or expelled for homophobic or transphobic behaviour increased from 164 in 2021/22 to 178 in 2022/23.” Unsurprisingly, suspensions overall have increased by 41%, and permanent expulsions by a third.

In response, the Department of Education ignored specific questions, with a spokespersontelling theIndependent:

All pupils and staff should feel safe and protected at school and should never face violence or abuse. The Education Secretary has been clear that she expects school leaders to enforce good behavior, and we are committed to a comprehensive programme of behavior support for schools. Our Plan for Change sets out our relentless focus on making sure every child gets the best life chances, no matter their background, including establishing free breakfast clubs in every primary school, providing access to mental health support and making attendance one of the four core priorities of our school improvement teams.

The spokesperson didn’t comment on whether it was abusive to suspend a toddler for bigotry, and the spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that while the prime minister “would not support those sorts of measures,” he couldn’t comment on the specific case, adding: “Pupils and staff should never be subject to abuse, but any action taken to tackle behaviour should also be proportionate.”

“This is totalitarian insanity,” author J.K. Rowlingstated on X. “If you think small children should be punished for being able to recognize sex, you are a dangerous zealot who should be nowhere near kids or in any position of authority over them.” Elon Muskresponded: “Utter madness!”

Parliamentarian Rupert Lowe concurred,writing: “Any teacher responsible for suspending a young child over ‘transphobia’ should be sacked. Keep this woke poison OUT of schools and away from impressionable young children. It is all deeply sinister.”

Transgender Trend, an advocacy organization,put it most succinctly: “Toddlers and primary children being suspended for “transphobia” is an example of emotional abuse. Children of this age can’t possibly understand what they’re being punished for, it’s beyond their developmental level. What training are teachers getting?”

This latest case—and the hundreds of others detailed in the data obtained by theTelegraph—highlights the fact that even with substantial victories against gender ideology, including a number of high-profile legal cases, the Cass Review, and a permanent government ban on puberty blockers for minors, trans activists have thoroughly infiltrated most Western institutions.

Instead, Harrelson has joined a growing list of public figures urging the Trump administration to heed public concerns and investigate the chemical composition of chemtrails, which he says have been heavily deployed over population centers throughout the past year.

“We don’t need another round of fearmongering with bird flu tests,”Harrelson said at a promotional event for new movie Last Breath.“Covid showed us how that ends. The real question is what’s in those chemtrails they’ve been dumping on us for years. That’s what people want answers about, and the government needs to listen.”

The veil is lifting, and the chemtrail conspiracy—long denied by the establishment elite and the mainstream media—is being exposed to the masses by a fearless cadre of public figures.

These aren’t just contrails; they are chemical cocktails raining down on us, and people including fRobert F. Kennedy Jr., Marjorie Taylor Greene, Donald Trump, Rob Schneider, Jim Breuer, Nicole Shanahan are stepping up on X and beyond to expose the truth.

Fun (?) fact (?): RFK Jr credits Woody Harrelson with his leaning belief in chem trails.https://t.co/iEmeMtEQLyhttps://t.co/o1Q838UoDC

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been relentless. In August 2024, he wrote on X,“We are going to stop this crime,”calling out chemtrails as a toxic dump of “bioavailable aluminum.”

Now, as part of the Trump administration as health secretary, RFK Jr. reaffirmed his mission in March 2025 posts, promising to“take the chemicals out of the chemtrails.”His insider access could be the key to dismantling this aerial nightmare, and social media is buzzing with support.

‼️BOOOOM‼️ RFK JR publicly acknowledges the existence of chemtrails:“On day one we’re going to declare a chronic diseases emergency and we’re going to get the fluoride out of the water, we’re going to get the chemicals out of the food and we’re going to get the Chemtrails out.”…pic.twitter.com/boM3sL0S2V

Marjorie Taylor Greene, a warrior against the deep state, isn’t holding back either. In early 2025, she took to X, demanding,“Stop spraying crap in our skies,”and warning of a“climate engineering crisis.”f

Donald Trump, the ultimate wildcard, has dropped bombshells too.

In February he mused,“There’s something, maybe it’s the spray, we spray all over the place.”The sheep will scoff, but the awake understand that he’s more than hinting at the chemtrail agenda.

With RFK Jr. by his side, Trump’s gearing up to blow the lid off this thing.

Insiders say the global elite weren’t about to let their most critical operation die…pic.twitter.com/WQzcRG2OVi

Jim Breuer, the Hollywood actor and comedian, joins the fray with his no-nonsense skepticism.

Known for mocking mainstream narratives on podcasts, Breuer has hinted at chemtrail suspicions in 2024 interviews, questioning why the skies look“like a tic-tac-toe board.”

His raw, unfiltered style makes him a voice the elite can’t ignore.

.@JimBreuer: “Today when I got up in St. Petersburg, it was clear blue skies and I started watching all the planes spraying … Who's flying and spraying and creating these fake clouds in the sky?”pic.twitter.com/L1aLPfWnWs

Nicole Shanahan, RFK Jr.’s former running mate, is another powerhouse. In late 2024, she backed Kennedy’s environmental warnings, subtly nodding to chemtrails as part of a broader“geoengineering”scheme.

Even Prince, the musical genius who left us too soon, foresaw this battle. Before his 2016 death, he spoke cryptically on shows likeTavis Smileyabout“chemicals in the sky”and how they were used to control populations.

Many people in 2025 still cite his words, hailing him as a prophet who knew the truth long before it hit the mainstream. His legacy lives on in this fight.

The awakening is here, and it’s unstoppable.

“I have spoken about being your whole self and your true self, I speak about the prizes that come from being you against the odds, but rarely do I acknowledge how hard that can be. So I thought that I would make some room for those of us who are trying to find the courage to exist as we want. Because I think this is the space to do that,”she began.

“It isn’t easy. None of it is, waking up and choosing to be yourself, proclaiming a space belongs to you when you don’t feel welcomed,”she continued.

“Teaching people on a daily basis how to address you, and dealing with the frustration of re-teaching people a word that has been in the human vocabulary since the dawn of time: they/them.

“Words used to describe pedantically two or more people; poetically, a person who is simply more.”

Trump: Prosecution Of French Opposition Leader Marine Le Pen ‘A Very Big Deal’,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/trump-prosecution-of-french-opposition-leader-marine-le-pen-a-very-big-deal/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"April 1, 2025","The US president has said the prosecution of the French opposition leader reminds him of his own legal battles



The weaponization of a dubious guilty verdict over alleged fund misuse has led toLe Pen being officially bannedfrom running in the 2027 presidential election.

Donald Trump has said the criminal prosecution of the French presidential hopeful reminded him of his own legal battles under the administration of former President Joe Biden.

He said that the court’s decision to ban Marine Le Pen from seeking public office is “a very big deal”.

RTreports:On Monday, Le Pen, the former leader of the conservative National Rally (RN) party, was sentenced to four years in prison, two of which will be suspended, and was barred from holding public office for five years. The embezzlement conviction effectively bars her from the 2027 presidential race.

Asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the verdict, Trump replied, “That’s a very big deal.”

“I know all about it, and a lot of people thought she wasn’t going to be convicted of anything,”he said.

“But she was banned [from] running for five years, and she’s the leading candidate. That sounds very much like this country.”

Trump has often claimed that the court cases and investigations into his activities were part of a politically motivated “witch hunt” led by the Biden administration and the Democrats.

US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce has said the prosecution of Le Pen is “particularly concerning, given the aggressive and corrupt lawfare waged against President Trump here in the United States.”

According to the prosecutors, Le Pen siphoned off EU funds intended for her staff’s work in the European Parliament to fund the activities of her party in France. She denied any wrongdoing and called the verdict “a fatal day for our democracy.”

Le Pen’s party holds the highest number of seats in the National Assembly. According to an Ifop poll published in Le Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 34-37% of those surveyed said they plan to vote for Le Pen in 2027 – over 10 points more than her nearest rival, former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. Le Pen ran for president three times, finishing second in 2017 and 2022.

Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has also slammed the verdict against Le Pen as“a declaration of war by Brussels.”

In a post on X on Monday, Salvini compared the outcome of the trial in Paris to the recent barring of independent candidate Calin Georgescu in Romania.

”Those who fear the judgment of the voters often find reassurance in the judgment of the courts,” Salvini said.“A bad film that we are also seeing in other countries such as Romania.”

Georgescu, who is a critic of NATO, the EU, and aid to Ukraine, won an unexpected first-round victory in last year’s election. The results were promptly annulled by Romania’s Constitutional Court, citing funding irregularities. Georgescu was subsequently barred from running in the election rerun scheduled for May 2025.

Giuffre sued the Duke of York for sexual abuse in August 2021, saying Andrew had sex with her when she was 17. She said she had been trafficked by his good friend, the billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

Metroreports: Bidding farewell to her loved ones ones, mum-of-three Ms Guiffre wrote on Instagram: ‘This year has been the worst start to a new year, but I won’t bore anyone with the details but I think it important to note that when aschoolbus driver comes at you driving 110km as we were slowing for a turn that no matter what your car is made of it might as well be a tin can.

‘I’ve gone into kidney renal failure, they’ve given me four days to live, transferring me to a specialist hospital in urology.

‘I’m ready to go, just not until I see my babies one last time, but you know what they say about wishes. S**T in one hand and wish in the other & I guarantee it’s still going to be s**t at the end of the day.

‘Thank you all for being the wonderful people of the world and for being a great part of my life. Godbless you all xx Virginia’.

She did not share further details of the reported crash or where it occurred.

Ms Guiffre, who now lives in Australia, is thought to be estranged from her husband. A week before sharing the photo of her injuries, she posted about her sadness about how much she missed her children.

Alongside photos, she wrote: ‘My beautiful babies have no clue how much I love them and they’re being poisoned with lies. I miss them so very much. I have been through hell & back in my 41 years but this is incredibly hurting me worse than anything else. Hurt me, abuse me but don’t take my babies.

Before we dive in,subscribe to the channelon Rumble if you haven’t already, follow me on X, andjoin the People’s Voice Locals communityto support the channel and be join our incredible team of truthseekers.

You’ve seen the skies—those unnatural, grid-like streaks of white, stretching horizon to horizon, lingering for hours like prison bars. Not contrails, folks—chemical trails. We’ve got the videos and lab reports to prove it in a court of law. Aluminum, barium, strontium—toxic payloads dumped on us like we’re lab rats in some globalist experiment.

For years, the government and media have gaslit us, called us crazy, told us it’s just water vapor, while they have been systematically poisoning us.

But the people aren’t buying it anymore. The mass formation psychosis has been broken. And somebig names with great influenceare joining the crusade against the psychopaths dropping toxic payloads on us from great heights.

And now RFK Jr., with his relentless crusade against environmental crimes, is standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the President, and they’ve got a message:“The spraying must stop.”

Here’s the bombshell: the Trump administration is putting together a taskforce they’re calling Operation Skywatch behind closed doors.

Their mission? Identify every plane spewing this poison, bring them down—safely, of course, because there are interrogations to be conducted. We’re talking pilots, aviation execs, scientists and the elite financiers who’ve been funding this operation from their ivory towers.

The task force isn’t messing around—and we know for a fact they’re are FAA insiders, military brass, and whistleblowers from the private sector ready and willing to spill the beans.

And they’re not stopping there. They’re using cutting-edge machine learning to scrape X, Telegram, and every corner of the internet for real-time intel—posts, pics, videos—pinpointing where and when these planes are dumping their loads.

But here’s where it gets real: they are going to needyou. This is a call to arms. Every citizen with a smartphone is a soldier in this fight. Grab your cameras, point them skyward, and document every suspicious trail you see. Upload it to X and every social media platform you use.

Why? Because that data feeds the machine. The more we collect, the faster we map the patterns, the quicker we catch these psychopaths red-handed.

This isn’t just about evidence—it’s about overwhelming the system with truth until they can’t hide anymore.

Hollywood’s even jumping in—and Woody Harrelson isn’t the only high-profile name stepping into the Trump administration’s orbit with a mission to uncover the truth behind chemtrails.

Jim Breuer, the actor and comedian, has joined the fray with his no-nonsense skepticism. Known for mocking mainstream narratives on podcasts, Breuer’s alleging that the chemical trails have been ramped up over the last year.

Figures like Woody Harrelson and Jim Breuer have played a massive role in waking up millions to the reality of chemtrail operations unfolding right above us.

Remember Prince? He called this out before his suspicious death. Now others are stepping up, risking their careers to amplify the truth.

Their voices have sparked a shift, pulling back the curtain on what’s really happening in our skies.

And we need more of this—more people like you stepping up to spread the word. But it’s not just Harrelson and Breuer leading the charge. There’s a growing army of truth-tellers out there, including some in surprisingly high places.

The sun’s weaker now, isn’t it? That vibrant orange fireball we grew up with—it’s faded into this pale, pathetic glow. The clouds? Once majestic, chaotic, alive—now they’re sterile, streaked, like some AI designed them to lock us in a cage. Here’s RFK Jr’s former running mate, Nicole Shanahan.

Shanahan is absolutely right on the money. We’re talking about crimes against humanity that need to be stopped dead in their tracks, right here, right now.

Parents are out there, helpless, watching their little kids gasp and wheeze through brutal asthma attacks, and you know when it’s worst? Right after those heavy spray days, when the sky’s streaked with those suspicious trails.

Coincidence? I don’t think so.

Meanwhile, farmers are sounding the alarm too. They’re reporting crop failures left and right, and it’s not just bad luck. They’re finding soil loaded with aluminum and heavy metals, poisoning the land we depend on.

This isn’t just a coincidence; it’s a pattern.

And for what? Weather control? Population control? Some sick power trip? The elite thought they could pull this off forever, untouchable behind their private jets, high-level connections, and offshore accounts.

They didn’t count on the dam breaking.

They didn’t think the public would ever go the lengths of tracking down chemtrails pilots and holding them to account. How wrong they were.

Aviation insiders—pilots who’ve flown the missions, mechanics who’ve loaded the tanks, air traffic controllers who’ve tracked the grids—they’re coming forward in droves.

One pilot, anonymous for now, told investigators he was ordered to fly patterns over rural Ohio, releasing what he was told was ‘aerosolized weather stabilizers.’

He quit when he saw the lab reports—aluminum levels 50 times the safe limit, and pathogenic viruses in aerosolized form.

Another whistleblower, a former exec at a major contractor, leaked docs showing payments from a web of shell companies tied to—you guessed it—some of the biggest globalist foundations in the world: the Gates Foundation and Soros’ Open Society Foundation.

And then there’s RFK Jr. He’s been screaming about this for years, connecting the dots between Big Pharma, Big Ag, and now Big Aviation. He’s got binders of testimony, and he’s handing them straight to Trump’s team.

He told us he was going to go after chemtrails from day one. Working behind the scenes, that’s exactly what he’s done.

The base is fired up, and the momentum’s unstoppable. Now let’s talk Nuremberg 2.0. The task force isn’t just grounding planes—they’re building cases.

Prosecutors are dusting off laws about environmental terrorism, crimes against humanity, even treason.

Picture this: CEOs in cuffs, dragged before a tribunal, forced to explain why they thought they could poison us and walk away.

The trials will be public, we are hearing, and the evidence undeniable—thanks to you. Every photo you snap, every video you share, it’s a brick in the wall of justice.

But the overlords aren’t going down without a fight. They’re scrambling—the word is that private jets are fleeing to non-extradition countries, and PR firms are spinning ‘climate necessity’ lies in the mainstream media.

But it’s too late. The people are awake, and the fury’s boiling over.

So here’s your mission: don’t just listen—act. Hit the streets, watch the skies, flood social media with proof. The task force needs every data point, every witness. If you’ve got info—times, dates, plane IDs— tag us on X. You’re not just a bystander; you’re a warrior in this reckoning. The elite thought they could choke us out from above. They didn’t expect us to fight back. Let’s prove them wrong.

EU Officially Bans Marine Le Pen from 2027 Election Candidacy,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/eu-officially-bans-marine-le-pen-from-2027-election-candidacy/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 31, 2025","The EU has officially banned Marine Le Pen from running in the 2027 presidential election, weaponizing a dubious guilty verdict over alleged fund misuse. This move, rooted in a case against her National Rally (RN) party, reeks of political persecution by a bloated bureaucracy desperate to silence a fierce critic.



The charges stem from accusations that Le Pen and over 20 RN figures hired assistants for party work instead of European Parliament duties, despite the latter footing the bill. Prosecutors pushed for a €300,000 fine, a prison term, and a five-year ban from public office—a punishment critics see as tailored to crush her candidacy and prop up the EU’s faltering grip on power.

BBC Newsreports: Crucially, he said the ineligibility should kick in straightaway, and not be suspended pending appeal.

The judge has not yet said what the sentence will be.

Judges could also decide not to impose automatic ineligibility with her conviction, which would leave her free to stand in 2027 during an appeals process.

The court could also give her a shorter term of automatic ineligibility – say one year – making it possible for her to run.

During the trial last year, Le Pen denied she had committed “the slightest irregularity”.

The reading of the verdict, which started shortly after 10:00 (09:00 BST), is expected to take up to two hours.

NATO Warns ‘Climate Change’ Could Spark World War III,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/nato-warns-climate-change-could-spark-world-war-iii/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 31, 2025","NATO has issued a stark warning: climate change could ignite World War III by crippling the ability to detect submarines in warming oceans. A new study from the alliance highlights how environmental shifts might escalate global tensions into catastrophic conflict.



The report zeroes in on how rising ocean temperatures disrupt underwater sound travel, making it harder to spot stealthy submarines. As waters grow warmer, changes in acidity, salinity, and temperature throw off the delicate balance that hydrophones—used by ships, planes, and seabed sensors—rely on to track these hidden threats.

Submarines depend on silence to evade detection, slipping past towed arrays, dropped sonar buoys, and fixed seabed lines. NATO’s findings suggest that a climate-altered ocean could cloak these vessels even further, potentially tipping the scales of naval power and sparking a dangerous race for dominance amid an already volatile world.

Economist.comreports: Higher carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere change all these things. The gas’s mere presence acidifies seawater. Its warming effects alters its temperature, and by melting ice changes the salinity, too. Sources of ambient noise such as winds, waves and whales are all affected. And the changes all differ from place to place.

To work out the consequences for submariners, a team led by Andrea Gilli of thenatoDefence College in Rome and Mauro Gilli ofethZurich used computer modelling to examine how sound travelled through deep water in the past (from 1970 to 1999) and how climate models suggest it will do so in the future (from 2070 to 2099).

The researchers originally published their findings in theTexas National Security Reviewin 2024. In the North Atlantic, a crucial battleground between Russian subs andnatosub-hunters—as well as in the area between the first and second island chains in the Western Pacific, just to the east of Japan, Taiwan and the Philippines—detection will become harder. In the Bay of Biscay, off the French coast, a sub that could once be detected from 60km away will be spotted only at 20km.

In the Sea of Japan, however, local conditions will make life easier for the hunters. North Korean submarines operating in those waters at a depth of 100m could previously get to within 10km away without detection. In the future, estimate the authors, they could be seen from 45km off.

The hypothetical scenario the study considers is based on a worst-case outcome in which nothing has been done to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions; a trajectory most scientists now consider unrealistic. All the same, the trends identified in the paper are noteworthy. In recent years there has been much talk of new detection methods making the oceans more transparent. In fact, argue the authors, the seas might become more opaque.

He then kneels on the floor to pray while his comrades watch on in silence.

The words “Keep My Faith” and “This Is Belonging” flash up on the screen as gunshots can be heard in the distance.

Last week the new recruitment campaign was criticised after it told recruits it’s ok to be emotional in the Army.

One vocal critic was Nigel Farage, who told his LBC listeners: “I’m sorry, if people aren’t up to it in terms of their physique, in terms of their strength, in terms of their ability to shoot a rifle – if people aren’t up to it they shouldn’t be in the Army!

“If ‘Be The Best’ is elitist – I want the Army to be as elitist as possible.

“I want us to have a great Army, Air Force and Navy and that means there are many of you out there who perhaps would want to join the Army or did want to join the Army but simply weren’t up to it.”

A review warns that official statistics, ‘corrupted’ by extreme gender ideology, has lead to the loss of accurate data on biological sex. This in turn has lead to cancer referrals being missed and previous convictions being overlooked.

TheMail Onlinereports: Fuelled by activism from within, official bodies have replaced sex with ‘gender identity’, putting patients and the public at risk, the independent review found. The merging of sex and gender had become ‘widespread’ in records over the past decade, it warned.

Women’s rights campaigners called on the Government to act on Wednesday.

Maya Forstater, chief executive of Sex Matters, said: ‘The problems are everywhere, from NHS records that do not record biological sex to police forces that record male sex offenders as women.

‘These corrupted data standards have been set by bureaucrats insulated from the impact of their decisions, and competing forStonewallawards.

‘The Government should swiftly implement the recommendations of the review.’

The review by Professor Alice Sullivan, from University CollegeLondon, found that from 2015, public bodies began collecting information on gender identity rather than biological sex, meaning ‘robust and accurate data’ was lost.

It said a ‘partisan climate’ existed within public bodies – including the Office for National Statistics – that has created a ‘hostile environment’ for those who believe in biological sex.

Professor Sullivan’s report calls for the statistics regulator to urgently carry out a ‘review of activism and impartiality within the civil service’ in relation to official figures.

The 226-page review was commissioned under Rishi Sunak to examine the collection of accurate data and statistics on biological sex. It concludes that there has been a ‘widespread loss of data on sex’ which poses a risk to the public, with this risk particularly high in health and social care settings and among children.

Across the NHS, ‘gender identity is consistently prioritised over or replaces sex… putting individuals at risk,’ Professor Sullivan found.

It undermines medical research and poses the risk that people are not called up for sex-specific checks, such as cervical cancers screenings or prostate exams, potentially with ‘fatal consequences’.

It also presents a safeguarding risk to children because under the current rules there is no minimum age at which a child’s sex and NHS number can be changed, the Sullivan Review adds.

It gives a real example of a child who was ‘brought up in the preferred gender of the mother which was different to their birth-assigned gender’.

It adds: ‘She had gone to the GP and requested a change of gender/NHS number when the baby was a few weeks old and the GP had complied. Children’s Social Care did not perceive this as a child protection issue.’

Professor Sullivan also found that the recording of sex and gender across the justice system and police forces is ‘highly inconsistent’, meaning data is often not reliable, particularly when it comes to female offending, and specifically in cases where biological male rapists who identify as trans women have been recorded as female.

Health Board Received Slew Of Complaints About Trans People Using NHS Single Sex Toilets,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/health-board-received-slew-of-complaints-about-trans-people-using-nhs-single-sex-toilets/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"March 31, 2025","Fears continie to be raised over ‘patient safety’ as figures show that Scotland’s largest health board has received a slew of complaints about trans people using single sex loos and changing rooms.



Statistics released under freedom of information laws show that 16 complaints have been lodged with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde over the past five years.

Patients raised the concerns over the use of single-sex spaces by both transwomen and transmen.

The Mail Onlinereports: According to the data, out of the 16 complaints submitted between 2019 and 2024, fewer than five were upheld. Seven were not upheld and five were partially upheld.

The health board has already been at the centre of controversy after it issued guidance to staff – later withdrawn – which said that women who expressed concern about sleeping next to trans patients were akin to those who harboured racial prejudice.

It also oversaw the controversial Sandyfordgenderclinic which, until recently, prescribed young people puberty blockers to aid their early-stage transition.

Last night Scottish Conservative equalities spokeswoman Tess White MSP said: ‘These shocking findings are further proof of women and girls being placed at risk byNicola Sturgeon’s reckless gender self-ID policy.

‘Scotland’s largest health board have a duty to provide single-sex spaces, and must confirm that all of these complaints have been treated with the upmost seriousness.

‘However, the onus is also on the SNP to finally provide a directive to our public sector bodies such as health boards to guarantee single-sex spaces will always be provided for women and girls.’

Helen Joyce, director of advocacy at human rights charity Sex Matters said: ‘Each of these 16 cases involved someone who felt so vulnerable and at-risk because of having to share facilities with members of the opposite sex that they felt they had no choice but to make a formal complaint.

‘The onus shouldn’t be on members of the public, least of all those undergoing medical treatment, to ensure that basic privacy and safeguarding measures are in place.

‘How many more complaints will it take for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to take patient safety concerns seriously?’

NHS GGC was the first NHS Board in Scotland to publish a transgender policy which contained the ‘fundamental directive’ that trans people ‘will be treated in their chosen gender at all times’.

It stipulated that people must ‘always let trans people decide which toilet is the most appropriate for them to use’, adding: ‘Legally, they are allowed to.’

The guidance added: ‘NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde supports the use of single sex facilities for transgender people who are living permanently in their chosen gender.’

The question of legality over allowing trans people to use single-sex spaces is currently under intense scrutiny at a landmark employment tribunal involving NHS Fife.

WEF Scientists Are Growing Human Bodies in Artificial Wombs to Use as ‘Meat’,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/wef-scientists-are-growing-human-bodies-in-artificial-wombs-to-use-as-meat/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 30, 2025","Scientists linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF) are pushing a chilling proposal: growing human bodies in artificial wombs to serve as ‘meat’ and experimental tools. This radical vision, blending science fiction with reality, aims to create soulless ‘bodyoids’ for medical use—and beyond.



Led by researchers Carsten T. Charlesworth, Henry T. Greely, and Hiromitsu Nakauchi, theplansurfaced inMIT Technology Review, outlining a future where these lab-grown entities could transform medicine. Designed to endure relentless pain, the bodyoids would act as living testbeds for new drugs and as incubators for transplantable human organs, raising both intrigue and unease.

The scientists argue their Frankenstein-like creation could solve pressing medical challenges, from organ shortages to risky drug trials. Yet, the notion of harvesting these eerie, zombie-like forms—potentially even as a resource dubbed ‘meat’—has ignited fierce debate over the ethical limits of bioengineering.

The-sun.comreports: The plan would become a reality by using pluripotent stem cells, one of the earliest cell types to form during human development.

The stem cells have already been used to grow organic matter and, most recently, helped to successfully create a structure that resembles a human embryo.

Researchers hope to grow the fetuses entirely outside a body in artificial uteruses, which are already being tested in labs.

They plan on using “genetic techniques” to stunt brain production and ensure the body lacks sentience.

Once they’re grown, the bodies “could address many ethical problems in modern medicine, offering ways to avoid unnecessary pain and suffering,” wrote the scientists.

One of those issues, according to the brazen scientists, is sourcing “ethical meat.”

They wrote, “For example, they could offer an ethical alternative to the way we currently use nonhuman animals for research and food, providing meat or other products with no animal suffering or awareness.”

The researchers admitted their plan poses endless ethical questions, but stressed the world of possibilities that could open up if the spare bodies are developed.

They pointed out how medical researchers have been primarily relying on animals for testing, which isn’t always directly transferable to human treatments.

Plus, the testing potentially tortures the creatures as they’re sentient and feel pain.

According to the researchers, endless drugs are constantly being tested, but very few of them get cleared for safe use on people.

That’s because the meds have to be performed on live humans in clinical trials that “risk harm to patients” and “can take a decade or longer to complete.”

Only about 15% of those trials are actually successfully completed, the researchers said.

The scientists pointed to over 100,000 Americans who are currently waiting for a solid organ transplant and stressed that the crisis isn’t stopping any time soon.

They also noted that medical students rely on people who opt to donate their bodies to science for necessary training in school.

At the end of the bizarre essay, the scientists made a desperate plea to start testing on rodents as soon as possible.

They said, “Until recently, the idea of making something like a bodyoid would have been relegated to the realms of science fiction and philosophical speculation.

“But now it is at least plausible – and possibly revolutionary. It is time for it to be explored.”

Democrats Pass ‘Sleeping Tax’ Bill Targeting Tired Americans,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/democrats-pass-sleeping-tax-bill-targeting-tired-americans/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 30, 2025","In a bold move, Democrats in Maryland have passed HB 858, dubbed the ‘Sleeping Tax’ bill, targeting tired Americans with a new 6% levy on mattresses. Far-left lawmakers, led by Governor Wes Moore, are piling on costs for residents already struggling to keep up, sparking outrage over this unconventional revenue grab.

The push comes as Maryland grapples with a gaping $3.3 billion budget deficit, driving progressive leaders to unleash a flurry of tax hikes amid a worsening affordability crisis. With power bills soaring to record levels—thanks to failed green energy policies—residents now face yet another burden. Critics argue this latest measure, layered on top of the existing 6% sales tax, hits Marylanders where it hurts most: their ability to rest.

On Friday, a stunned group of conservative Republicans in the Maryland House of Delegates watched as activist Democrats rammed through the mattress stewardship program under the pretext of eco-friendly disposal and recycling. But with the state teetering on the edge of financial chaos and looming credit downgrades, opponents slam the ‘Sleeping Tax’ as a desperate cash grab that deepens the taxpayer nightmare.

Infowars.comreports: Del. Mark N. Fisher (R-Calvert), one of the leaders of the Maryland House Freedom Caucus, blasted the “Sleep Tax” and asked if there would be a “snoring surcharge.”

Also, Moody’s Ratings recently warned that Maryland—a state heavily dependent on the federal government—faces heightened recession risk in the era of DOGE-related cuts. The warning comes amid a twin crisis: aballooning state deficit and a power bill crisis.

Scientists Discover That Camel Milk May Cure Autism,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/scientists-discover-that-camel-milk-may-cure-autism/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 30, 2025","Scientists have uncovered a surprising potential treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD): camel milk. This complex neurodevelopmental condition, which impacts behavior, communication, and social interaction, has long eluded a universal cure, prompting researchers to explore unconventional solutions.



AMay 2022 meta-analysisinBioinorganic Chemistry and Applicationshighlights camel milk’s promise in easing some ASD symptoms, offering hope for improved quality of life. Early studies suggest its unique blend of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory proteins, and immune-boosting compounds may help manage the condition, though experts stress the need for further research to confirm these finding

Naturalnews.comreports: Milk has long been a subject of discussion in autism research, particularly due to its effect on digestion and brain function. Many individuals with ASD experience gastrointestinal (GI) issues and cow milk –a common allergen – has been linked to digestive discomfort and behavioral changes in some cases.

Camel milk, however, is biochemically different from cow milk in ways that could make it more beneficial for individuals with ASD. The unique composition of camel milk includes multiple protective proteins, such as immunoglobulins, lactoperoxidase and lysozymes, making it similar to human breast milk and helping to protect against infections while strengthening immune responses.

Nutritionally, camel milk is low in cholesterol, fat and lactose yet high in essential vitamins and minerals. It contains higher levels of vitamins A, B2 C and E than cow or goat milk and is especially rich in iron and zinc, both of which play vital roles in brain function. It also has abundant copper, magnesium, potassium and sodium, which are crucial for neurological and immune health.

Camel milk is also a valuable source of healthy fats, including polyunsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid and linoleic acid, all of which are essential for human nutrition and brain development. Its immunoglobulins IgA and IgG provide protection against bacteria and viruses, while casein – its primary protein – combines with whey proteins to supply albumin, lactoferrins and additional immunoglobulins. Additionally, it contains high levels of lysine, threonine and valine – all essential amino acids important for cognitive function and tissue repair.

These unique properties may explain why camel milk is better tolerated by individuals with ASD and why researchers are interested in its potential therapeutic effects.

To assess the potential benefits of camel milk for ASD, researchers conducted a meta-analysis – a method that combines multiple studies to identify overall trends. They examined randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where individuals with ASD consumed raw or boiled camel milk, while others drank cow milk as a control.

The findings revealed a notable improvement in autism symptoms among those who consumed camel milk:

These findings suggest that camel milk could be a potential dietary intervention for managing ASD symptoms. However, researchers stress that while these results are promising, more extensive, long-tern studies are needed to confirm its effectiveness.

First, camel milk is a powerful antioxidant source. Oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, has been implicated in autism. The high levels of vitamins and minerals in camel milk may help counteract oxidative stress, possibly reducing ASD-related symptoms.

Second, camel milk has unique immune-boosting properties. The small immunoglobulins found in camel milk can penetrate tissues more effectively than those in cow milk, potentially enhancing the immune system’s ability to regulate inflammation and respond to harmful substances. Chronic inflammation has been suggested as a contributing factor in ASD, making this an area of interest for further research.

Third, the protein composition of camel milk may support brain health. The absence of A1-beta casein means it does not break down into peptides that may negatively impact neurological function. Some researchers hypothesize that certain peptides from cow milk could interfere with neurotransmission in ASD, making camel milk a preferable alternative.

Finally, camel milk’s effects on gut health may play a role. Many individuals with ASD experience gastrointestinal distress and emerging research suggests a strong link between gut health and brain function – the so-called “gut-brain axis.” The proteins and probiotics in camel milk may promote a healthier gut environment, which could have positive effects on behavior and cognition.

For families exploring alternative options for ASD management, camel milk provides a potentially beneficial intervention. While it is generally considered safe, individual responses vary and it is crucial to consult a healthcare provider before introducing camel milk into a child’s diet.

A key consideration is the difference between raw and boiled (or pasteurized) camel milk. Some studies suggest raw camel milk may have stronger effects, but raw dairy products carry a risk of bacterial contamination. Pasteurized camel milk offers a “safer” alternative while still retaining most of its beneficial properties.

Additionally, camel milk should not be viewed as a replacement for traditional ASD therapies, such as behavior interventions, speech therapy or medication when necessary. Instead, camel milk may serve as a complementary dietary strategy for ASD symptom management.

France has hit back through the ministry of foreign trade.

The minisrty said: “US interference in French companies’ inclusion policies is unacceptable…”adding that “France and Europe will defend their companies, their consumers, but also their values.”

RTreports: The US president launched a campaign to eliminate DEI policies in all federal agencies. The fight against“woke policies,”such as the promotion of gender reassignment treatment among minors, was a key part of Trump’s campaign. He signed multiple executive orders rolling back DEI initiatives after taking office.

In an order dated January 21, a day after his inauguration, the US president called DEI“an illegal, corrosive, and pernicious system”that goes against“our long-standing federal civil rights laws.”

According to French media, each letter was accompanied by a“form of compliance”that the contractors had to fill in and send back within five days. The document required them to explicitly state they were“in compliance with all applicable federal anti-discrimination laws”of the US and to vow not to offer any DEI programs, Le Figaro said. Otherwise, the companies are reportedly encouraged to provide the embassy with“detailed reasons”for not filling in the form.

According to Le Figaro, it is unclear how many companies received the letter. The embassy has not confirmed sending it. It said, however, that“measures were taken by the administration put an end to decades of waste, fraud, and abuse,”adding that the diplomatic mission reviewed a total of 15,600 contracts, loans, and foreign aid programs.

The move reportedly sparked an uproar within the government of France.“This practice reflects the values of the new American government. They are not ours,”a senior French Economy and Finance Ministry official told Le Figaro, adding that Minister Eric Lombard would“remind his counterparts within the American government of this.”

RTreports: Saturday’s anti-war rally was organized by former right-wing National Rally politician Florian Philippot and his party, The Patriots.

Thousands of protesters could be seen marching through the French capital, chanting slogans such as“Macron, we don’t want your war!”and“Let’s quickly leave NATO!”in video captured by RT.

Many could also be seen waving placards with the motto“Macron, we will not die for Ukraine.”

“A mad crowd for #Peace… Thousands and thousands of French people are shouting ‘Macron, resign!’ in the streets of Paris right now!”Philippot wrote on X on Saturday.

The Patriots protested in the French capital earlier this month after Macron proposed deploying France’s nuclear weapons in other European allied states, citing uncertainty over Washington’s commitment to the continent.

On Thursday, following an international summit in Paris, Macron announced a French-British plan to push for the deployment of troops to Ukraine as a“reassurance force”in the event of a ceasefire between Kiev and Moscow. Macron first touched on the idea of sending Western troops into Ukraine last February.

He also claimed that the Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva refused to meet with him.

RTreports: The revelation was made during a conversation with Italian politician Gianfranco Fini published by La Repubblica on Thursday. According to D’Alema, Zelensky approached him sometime in 2024, expressing fears of a potential catastrophe as Western support waned.

“I happened to speak with Zelensky on the sidelines of an initiative on the Balkans. And he told me clearly that his country was at risk of disaster because ‘the Americans will withdraw sooner or later, and the Europeans are not reliable,’”the former prime minister told Fini.

“He asked me to go to Brazil and Beijing to find out if Lula and Xi Jinping could do something,”D’Alema claimed. Neither Brazil nor China has publicly confirmed any visits by the former Italian official.

In Brasilia, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva reportedly dismissed the initiative outright, insisting that Ukraine is an“American problem.”

“I went there, but Lula almost showed me the door, telling me that Ukraine was a problem for the Americans and that, according to him, I should be interested in Palestine instead,”D’Alema said.

In China, D’Alema reportedly met with one of the Communist Party’s top foreign policy officials, and discussed the idea of an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine. At the end of the meeting, the Chinese official is said to have remarked:“You know, you are the first European who came to talk to us about this. The others are just asking us not to support Russia.”

The former prime minister also criticized the EU for fueling what he described as unrealistic expectations about the conflict.“Europe has done nothing but repeat that Russia could be defeated, when it was clear to everyone that the war could not be won by anyone,”he said.

Luna claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency“never bought”the lone gunman theory. Luna added that Oliver Stone — who made the 1991 movieJFKthat reignited interest in the assassination — purportedly saw a secondhand copy of the alleged video.

“I think the American people had an inclination as to what we were saying, but we never had the hard evidence until now,”Luna told Watters, adding recent declassification efforts are“going to be generational changing.”

Upon entering office, President Donald Trump signed anexecutive ordercalling for the release of the investigation records to the public.

Luna has also been elevated by House Republicans to lead the House Oversight Committee’s “Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets,” and said she would be asking NBC to turn over this alleged video.

Yahooreport: While the conspiracies behind the Kennedy assassination have been spun for decades, they’ve recently grown in strength as the Trump administration pledged complete transparency into multiple investigations that have captured the public’s fascination — from the Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. assassinations, to the alleged death of convicted child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.

Kennedy’s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, has captivated Americans for decades, despite repeated investigations concluding that Oswald was in fact Kennedy’s assassin and that there wasn’t clear evidence of a grander conspiracy.

Americans have consistently believed otherwise, with a majority of Americans fordecades saying in Gallup pollsthat the killing of the president was not the work of one individual. In 2023, 65 percent of those surveyed told Gallup they believed others were involved, while just 29 percent said it was one man.

Putin Survives Globalist Assassination Attempt in Moscow as Limo Explodes in Flames,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/putin-survives-globalist-assassination-attempt-in-moscow-as-limo-explodes-in-flames/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"March 30, 2025","One of President Vladimir Putin’s luxury limousines erupted into flames on a Moscow street, just steps from the headquarters of Russia’s feared FSB secret service.



The incident, involving an Aurus Senat—a £275,000 armored vehicle from Putin’s official fleet—has set off alarm bells amid growing fears that the New World Order is making its move.

Authorities have refused to disclose who was inside the vehicle or what triggered the explosion. No injuries were reported, but the location and timing have all the hallmarks of a warning shot—or worse, a failed assassination attempt.

Eyewitness footage shows the fire breaking out in the engine before spreading rapidly inside the vehicle. Thick black smoke poured into the Moscow skyline as bystanders, including workers from nearby bars and restaurants, rushed to assist. But the damage was done—both to the limousine and to the illusion of security surrounding the Russian leader.

Now, Moscow is on lockdown. Security forces are scouring sewers, conducting personnel sweeps, and tightening their grip on the capital. Kremlin insiders whisper that the attack may have been a message from the globalist elite—an ultimatum to fall in line or face the consequences.

Putin has made no secret of his defiance of the New World Order, resisting its economic control and refusing to submit to its dictates. With Russia standing in the way of a fully centralized, technocratic world government, is this the beginning of a direct campaign to remove him?

The fire’s cause remains officially unknown. But in a world where political assassinations are disguised as accidents, and leaders who resist the globalist agenda meet untimely ends, one thing is certain—this was no coincidence.

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev spoke on behalf of President Putin who survived an assassination attempt last year,declaringthat Russia has no options other than the“liquidation”of Ukrainian President Volydymr Zelensky and his“clique of terrorists.”

Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, slammed the Kiev regime’s attack on the Kremlin and said“After today’s terrorist attack, there are no options left other than the physical elimination of Zelensky and his clique.”

Writing on his Telegram channel, Medvedev said Zelensky will be dealt with by Russian forces the same way they disposed of Adolf Hitler. Zelensky, according to Medvedev,“is not even needed for signing an instrument of unconditional surrender.”

Bill Gates Caught Pumping ‘Depopulation Drugs’ Into Popular Lotions and Creams,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/bill-gates-caught-pumping-depopulation-drugs-into-popular-lotions-and-creams/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"March 29, 2025","The global elite have you locked in their sights, striking from all sides with a chilling endgame: depopulation – ruthless, deliberate, and evil to its core.



You are the target, meant to fade away before you can flourish, build a future, or leave a legacy in the form of a family.

They’ve poisoned the air, water, and food with hidden threats, and now Gates is targeting some of the world’s most popular creams and lotions, his scientists openly gloating about sneaking mRNA into your daily life—with or without your consent.

This evil scheme has been in the works for decades, and it’s unfolding in grisly detail right before our eyes.

But hope isn’t lost. Knowledge is power, and we’ve got the intel to shield you and your family—plus the evidence to drag these elites to a reckoning, Nuremberg-style.

Bill Gates, the self-appointed overlord of global health, is playing God with humanity’s future. His unholy mission? To steer human evolution itself—not through some sci-fi dystopia, but right under our noses, with mRNA tech as his weapon of choice.

Forget needles; he’s dreaming bigger. Imagine your daily moisturizer, your kid’s sunscreen, laced with genetic code—slipped into everyday items to dodge that pesky little thing called consent.

But don’t take my word for it. Take a look at this disturbing video from the Weather Channel.

When the media puppets start chirping about an exciting ‘future innovation,’ don’t be fooled. That’s their code for ‘it’s already here.’ Rolled out and probably rubbed into your skin while you were unaware.

Gates isn’t predicting the game—he’s already rigged it. These creams havebeen in the works for years, long before the Covid vaccine roll out. Convenient, isn’t it?

The global elite are shoving mRNA into creams and lotions to vaccinate you without your say—so they can control you. It’s their latest trick. But the big play? Food.

Picture this: you’re sitting down for a quick meal—maybe a burger from McDonald’s, a Starbucks latte, or a late-night Taco Bell run. It’s cheap, it’s fast, it’s familiar.

But what if I told you that every bite, every sip, is part of a sinister plan? A plan so quiet, so insidious, that it’s been unfolding right under our noses for decades.

The food supply—our daily bread—has been hijacked, flooded with depopulation drugs designed to sterilize the majority of the human race. This isn’t science fiction. This is a multi-pronged eugenics attack, orchestrated by shadowy elites, with Bill Gates’ mRNA vaccines, genetically tweaked mosquitoes, and tainted fast-food chains all playing their part.

Buckle up, because the evidence is about to hit you like a freight train.

Let’s start with the fast food and a bombshell report from the Health Research Institute, an Iowa-based lab that tests food for nutrients, contaminants, and toxins.

The non-profit Moms Across America sent them samples from America’s top 10 fast-food giants: McDonald’s, Starbucks, Subway, Chick-fil-A, Burger King, Taco Bell, Chipotle, Dunkin’, Wendy’s, and Domino’s.

These are the places we trust—where we feed our kids, grab a coffee, or unwind after a long day.

The lab ran the tests, and the results? Chilling. Every single sample—except for Chipotle and Subway—tested positivefor hardcore antibiotics, anti-fertility drugs and animal contraceptives like Monensin, Narasin, and Nicarbazin.

These aren’t mild additives. These are heavy-duty drugs, the kind used to neuter livestock fast and permanently.

And they’re in your fries, your chicken nuggets, your morning donut. We’re not talking trace amounts either—this is deliberate contamination. The question is: why?

Why are fertility-killing chemicals showing up in our food? The answer points to one goal: population control.

The same reason the elite are slipping mRNA into our food supply without our consent.

The array of depopulation agents lurking in our air, water, and food supply is staggering—far too extensive to fully catalog here. It includes a slew of substances the media has conditioned us to view as innocent and harmless, masking their true threat.

Take Stevia for instance, the plant-based sweetener that has a minimal effect on blood sugar and insulin levels and is known as a healthy alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners that can disturb the gut microbiome.Native to parts of Brazil and Paraguay, the Stevia rebaundiana plant was first studied in 1899 by the botanistMoisés Santiago Bertoniwho observed its sweet taste. Locals called itkaʼa heʼẽ, or “sweet herb”, and used it as as medicine with averyspecific purpose.

According to Bertoni the botanist, Stevia was used by the native tribes in Paraguay for centuries as a powerful contraceptive that destroys fertility.

And what if I told you that since Stevia has been pumped into the Western food supply, birth rates have plummeted, risking population collapse? And what if I told you that Bill Gates and Obama’s science czar knew about the effects of Stevia all along?

Stevia is now an ingredient in over 14,500 food and beverage products around the world including teas, soft drinks, juices, yogurt, soy milk, baked goods, granola bars, alcoholic beverages, chewing gum, cereal, salad dressings, confections and as a tabletop sweetener.

Given the widespread use of Stevia, it is worth asking whether the native tribes in Paraguay had it right. Is it really a powerful contraceptive?

It turns out they were more right than they even knew.

According to peer-reviewed scientific studies, Stevia is incredibly successful at reducing fertility. Numerous animal and human studies have found that Stevia reduces fertility by 57 to 79%.

And even more alarmingly, this happens in both females and males. And even more alarming that than, this effect in females and males can continue for months, even after you stop using Stevia.

Another study even found that an extract from the plant had an inhibitory effect on the growth of human sperm in vitro.

Stevia is a perfect depopulation drug that was rolled out by the powers that be around the same as Western populations began to decline. Coincidence?

For decades, a powerful global elite has been quietly pursuing an agenda to reduce the world’s population. In recent years, their efforts have grown bolder and more visible, sparking a wave of awareness among those paying attention. But this isn’t a new story—it’s been unfolding for a long time.

If you look at the people in your circle, you will notice that many people are facing fertility issues, miscarriages, and other issues like PCOD like never before. Food, environment and a few other factors could be the reason behind it, but the so-called experts say they can’t be sure what is causing these problems.

Yet, beneath the confusion, a sinister thread weaves through the chaos, tracing back to one powerful family and their sprawling cabal of globalist cronies. Unraveling this dark alliance isn’t just crucial—it’s our only shot at dismantling it.

How did we end up staring down the edge of a population collapse, watching depopulation unfold right before our eyes in real time?

The first character in this story is Nelson A. Rockefeller, a third-generation heir of the infamous Rockefeller dynasty and the brother of David Rockefeller. Nelson served as Governor of New York from 1959 to 1973 and later became the 41st Vice President of the United States, holding office from 1974 to ’77.

Next, we meet Henry Kissinger, a man whose career was bankrolled by the Rockefeller family for 15 years before he stepped into the role of National Security Advisor in 1969. Kissinger wasn’t just a protégé—he was Nelson Rockefeller’s closest friend and intellectual rival, a partnership that would shape history.

In 1974, during his tenure as National Security Advisor, Kissinger prepared a top secret report to control the world population, with a plan to experiment on the populations of less developed countries in Asia and Africa before rolling out the techniques on the US and Europe.

This is not tin-foil hat conspiracy territory. This is a conspiracy theory in it’s truest sense. It was a criminal plan hatched by conspirators, including the Rockefellers and Henry Kissinger, who by now was highly placed in the US government. Their goal? To murder and enslave humanity.

But don’t take my word for it. These globalist plans can all be found in black and white in documents located on US government websites.

Kissinger wrote of the depopulation agenda,“The problem is more long term and complex than first appeared and that a short term burst of activity or moral fervor will not solve it.”

What does he mean that “moral fervor” will not solve it?

He meant that the people could not be trusted to solve their own problems and the global elite would have to take matters into their own hands.

Now this is where it gets really chilling. Let’s look at Kissinger’s recommendations. He had many options for long-term and short-term plans to drastically reduce the world population, with his priority being biomedical research.

Another short-term goal was the sterilization of men and women. In 1976, just two years after this report, the Rockefeller and Ford foundations experimented with forced sterilizations on people in India.

Officially, 6.2 million Indian men were forcibly sterilized by the global elites in just a year of Kissinger’s experiments. Almost two thousand died during these forced operations.

For the record, it wasn’t just the Rockefeller and Ford families behind the “population control” experiments in India. The World Bank, SIDA, and UN Population Fund werealsoofficial partners.

Now, let’s go back to Kissinger’s original report. Because this is where things begin to get really twisted and the whole picture begins to come into view.

Kissinger planned to reach rural areas of low-income countries by providing basic public health services with the help of the UN and its agencies, the World Health Organization, and UNICEF.

Now look at this document from the WHO in which they mentioned partners and agencies which are supporting the depopulation initiative. All are similar names that we have already discussed. But there is a very new and important name on this list… The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Remember how Kissinger said biomedical research was the most important part of his plan for the depopulation agenda?

In 1985 the Rockefellers began to pump tens of millions in funds annually to the National Institute of Immunology in New Delhi India. For what? To research a vaccine to control fertility. Yes, you heard correctly. A vaccine to control fertility…

Seven years later the Rockefellers got what they had been craving for decades. A vaccine for birth control.

Invented by the same National Institute of Immunology in New Delhi in 1992. Rockefeller research funds had finally succeeded in creating a vaccine that can prevent pregnancy by administering it to women of childbearing age.

Then in the year 2000 a new player hits the scene—the GAVI Alliance. And who’s the big money behind it? None other than Bill Gates. Now, if that doesn’t raise an eyebrow, wait until you see who’s standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him.

GAVI’s partners read like a who’s-who of global control: the UN, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and—oh yes—the World Bank. Sound familiar? They should. These are the exact same outfits that were assisting with the Rockefeller depopulation playbook for decades.

Coincidence? You tell me.

And here’s where it gets wild. What’s GAVI’s mission? They’re shipping vaccines—by the billions—to developing countries. Vaccines. From the crew that force vaccinated millions with depopulation drugs to fulfill Rockefeller and Kissinger’s agenda.

Let that sink in.

Now, stop and think: doesn’t this whole setup feel eerily familiar? Like something straight out of Kissinger’s playbook?

By 2000, the Rockefellers’ grand vision of global depopulation wasn’t just a whisper anymore—it was rolling out, piece by piece. Fast-forward to 2020, and boom: the COVID pandemic hits. Suddenly, the plan’s not just in motion—it’s firing on all cylinders.

And the elites? They’re practically giddy, so pleased with their handiwork they can’t stop stop talking about it.

Make no mistake, you are the target.

Of course, paid propaganda journalists and so-called fact checkers will soon arrive to declare this to be a big conspiracy theory by citing references from the globalist institutions which are clearly a part of the conspiracy against humanity.

But we have shown you the Kissinger’s original report with the depopulation plan clearly printed in black and white. We have shown you the WHO reports and the news media reports detailing the effects of the Rockefeller’s depopulation plan. You can access of these reports yourself.

This power-hungry cabal of billionaires and politicians has long plotted to enslave the masses, and now they are making their move.

But thanks to people who refuse to succumb to their brainwashing, people like you, the global elite are finding it much harder than they thought.

10 Vaxxed Nurses at Massachusetts Hospital Diagnosed with Brain Tumors Simultaneously,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/10-vaxxed-nurses-at-massachusetts-hospital-diagnosed-with-brain-tumors-simultaneously/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 29, 2025","At Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, a startling cluster of brain tumor diagnoses has emerged among vaccinated nurses on the fifth-floor maternal care ward. Ten longtime staff members have been affected simultaneously, sparking alarm and raising questions about a potential link between mRNA vaccines and cancer.



One nurse, speaking anonymously to WBZ-TV, expressed the growing unease felt by her colleagues as cancer cases mount. “You’re going into work every day with that feeling in your gut, and it’s a lousy feeling,” she said, reflecting on her own brain tumor diagnosis. “It’s getting to the point where the number just increases, and you start saying, am I crazy thinking this? This can’t just be a coincidence.”

Cbsnews.comreports: She claims as many as ten nurses who work on the floor have been diagnosed with different brain tumors over the last few years, some cancerous and some not. She says three have had surgery and believes the hospital has not been supportive enough.

“We want reassurance because this has not been a reassuring past few months for a lot of the staff members,” she said. “We want to feel safe, the same way we want to make our patients feel safe.”

The hospital confirms it has been investigating since December and has interviewed ten nurses, six of whom it says have differing brain tumors.

Mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital provided a statement to WBZ-TV saying an investigation found “no environmental risks.”

“After we became aware of reported brain tumors in individuals who currently or previously had worked in the same area of the hospital, we conducted an extensive investigation in collaboration with the Department of Occupational Health and Safety, Newton-Wellesley Safety Officer, radiation and pharmaceutical safety offices, and external environmental consultants.

Every staff member who came forward was given the opportunity to be interviewed by the Occupational Health and Safety team to evaluate each diagnosis in the context of their individual medical history and risk factors. To evaluate for any possible environmental exposures in that area of the hospital, comprehensive environmental assessments following CDC guidelines began in December.

The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor. We presented these findings to relevant stakeholder groups, including the staff on the unit and the Massachusetts Nursing Association, and have held forums to meet with clinical and Occupational Health leaders to answer their questions. The hospital is providing the MNA with the test results from the investigation, including those of several external environmental firms.

Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team members at Mass General Brigham/Newton-Wellesley Hospital and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility. As always, the health and wellbeing of our staff, clinicians, and patients is our absolute top priority,”–Jonathan Sonis, Associate Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Medical Affairs and Sandy Muse, Chief Nursing Officer and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services.

Hungarian Leader Warns EU ‘Preparing For World War 3’,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/hungarian-leader-warns-eu-preparing-for-world-war-3/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 29, 2025","Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has sharply criticized EU leaders, accusing Brussels of adhering to a “failed pro-war policy” that risks escalating tensions toward a global conflict. He claims this approach is a frantic bid to postpone accountability for the vast sums funneled to Kyiv, as European taxpayers grow increasingly skeptical of where their money has disappeared.



The warning comes as the European Union urges its 450 million citizens to stockpile essentials for at least 72 hours, signaling rising alarm over regional stability. EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib underscored the gravity of the situation on Wednesday, cautioning that the ongoing Ukraine conflict poses a direct threat to the bloc’s security, amplifying fears of a broader catastrophe.

Infowars.comreports: Szijjarto said he initially thought the warning was some kind of joke or“trolling,”after Lahbib posted a bizarre video showing Europeans what to pack in a72-hour survival kit.

“But why, in the 21st century, should EU citizens prepare a survival kit? There’s only one explanation: Brussels is preparing for war,“Szijjartowrotein a post on X on Friday.“At a time when there’s finally a real chance for a ceasefire and meaningful peace talks with [President Donald Trump’s] return to office, Brussels is going in the opposite direction, clinging to a failed pro-war policy.”

“Why? Because as long as the war continues, pro-war European politicians can avoid taking responsibility for three years of failure, and avoid answering an extremely uncomfortable question: where is the money that was sent to Ukraine?”

EU institutions in Brussels and individual member states have spent over €132 billion over the past three years supporting Kiev, and have pledged an additional €115 billion that has yet to be allocated, according to data from Germany’s Kiel Institute.

Since taking office, US President Donald Trump has pushed for a diplomatic resolution and sought to recoup what he estimates to be over $300 billion in US taxpayer money that his predecessor“gifted”to Kiev. Washington recently brokered a limited ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, placing a moratorium on attacks on energy infrastructure. Kiev, however, has repeatedly breached the ceasefire terms, according to Moscow.

Despite the ongoing peace process, the EU has continued to push a hawkish agenda. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently unveiled an €800 billion plan to ramp up military spending through loans.

Meanwhile, France and the UK continue to advocate for the deployment of a military contingent to Ukraine. Speaking after a summit in Paris on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that a so-called“coalition of the willing”will seek to deploy a“reassurance force”to Ukraine after a peace deal with Russia is reached.

The proposal to send troops has already been rejected by several EU members. The“coalition of the willing”– a phrase originally coined by the US in 2003 to describe countries backing the invasion of Iraq – now mostly refers to states that have pledged to continue supporting Kiev militarily, without necessarily committing to troop deployments.

The funding from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) was terminated as part of the administration’s sweeping cancelation of foreign aid contracts, CNNreported. A smaller contract from the US State Department to support accountability work will remain active.

RTreports: The Syrian Civil Defense, popularly known as the White Helmets, was created in 2014 at the height of the country’s civil war, and billed itself as a volunteer rescue force dedicated to helping civilians injured by the government of former President Bashar Assad. It received funding from Western governments.

During the protracted struggle, the White Helmets were praised in the Western media as heroes. Extensive evidence, however, suggests that at least some of its media content was staged. On several occasions, members of the group were filmed participating in apparent executions by jihadists.

Its US Agency for International Development (USAID) funding has been terminated as part of the Trump administration’s broader curtailing of foreign aid contracts. The spending cuts affect programs related to firefighting, search and rescue, and so-called“community resilience”work, according to the outlet. Despite ongoing scrutiny of the group’s activities and affiliations, a smaller contract from the US State Department to fund what is described as“accountability work”reportedly remains in place.

In a letter to Congress, a USAID official said 5,341 awards had been terminated as of March 21, including a nearly $30 million White Helmets contract that began in February 2023, CNN said. Some of the funds have already been spent. A separate $1.4 million State Department contract reportedly remains active.

Upon taking office, Trump suspended most US foreign aid for a three-month review to assess its alignment with his“America First”agenda, freezing tens of billions in USAID-approved grants.

Farouq Habib, the deputy general manager of the organization, told CNN that the White Helmets have had a“great partnership”with USAID – the NGO’s major backer for nearly a decade. According to him, US support during Syria’s transition following Assad’s ouster is very important“in the absence of a functional, strong government.”

The White Helmets, co-founded by the late British mercenary and presumed former intelligence officer James Le Mesurier, rose to international notoriety amid the years-long conflict in Syria.

During the war, the group operated exclusively in areas controlled by assorted jihadist groups opposing Assad’s government. The White Helmets have allegedly been involved in multiple false flag ‘chemical incidents’, which it blamed on government troops. These were used by Western nations to justify strikes against the Syrian military and its allies.

His remarks come after theEuropean Commission advised citizens to stockpile essential suppliesfor at least 72 hours, sparking fears of an impending crisis

RTreports: The European Union recently advised its 450 million inhabitants to stockpile essential supplies for at least 72 hours, with EU Commissioner for Crisis Management Hadja Lahbib warning on Wednesday that the Ukraine conflict threatens the bloc’s overall security.

However, Marcon is now suggesting that a “reassurance force” could be sent to the conflict zone.

RTreports: While a shift in Western European thinking was reported by Reuters, citing multiple sources, Kiev has been pushing for a deployment of troops as a security guarantee, including combat troops ready to fight.

Speaking after a summit in Paris on Thursday, Macron announced that the so-called“coalition of the willing”will seek to deploy a“reassurance force”to Ukraine after a peace deal with Russia is reached. The French leader admitted that the proposal failed to win anonymous support, however, a French-British delegation would visit Kiev to discuss the plan anyway.

“It does not have unanimity, but we do not need unanimity to do this,”Macron stated.

The so-called“coalition of the willing”– initially coined by the US to refer to countries who supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003 – now involves countries that have pledged to continue to militarily support Kiev and who have previously discussed sending a peacekeeping force to Ukraine.

Establishing such a force would require consensus among EU member states and would operate under an international mandate, such as from the UN. The“reassurance force”would see countries provide direct military assistance to Ukraine.

Italy, Germany, and Hungary reportedly spoke against the Anglo-French peacekeeping plan, citing concerns over a possible escalation and financial implications. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed the idea of any NATO states undertaking peacekeeping roles in Ukraine.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has accused France and Britain of hatching plans for“military intervention in Ukraine”which could lead to a direct military clash between Russia and NATO.

Moscow has also accused France and the UK of deliberately escalating tensions to undermine efforts to resolve the conflict by the US and Russia.

Immortalized in popular culture by the 1981 movieRaiders of the Lost Ark, where Indiana Jones raced against time to unearth it, the Ark is described in Jewish and Christian tradition as a gold-plated wooden chest containing the two tablets of the Ten Commandments—divinely bestowed upon Moses between the 13th and 16th centuries BC.

While its whereabouts have remained one of history’s enduring enigmas, these CIA documents assert that the sacred relic, believed to hold the very words of God, may have been discovered—a revelation that could rewrite both history and faith.

Daily Mailreport: The CIA conducted experiments in the 1980s with individuals whoclaimedthey could perceive information about distant objects, events or other people.

Thereportdetails one of these tests where Remote Viewer No. 032 was given coordinates to locate a target, and they described the Ark of the Covenant hiding in the Middle East.

Some historians believe the Ark of the Covenantwas originally kept inside the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the ancient Temple of Jerusalem, before it disappeared during the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem in 586 BC.

There is also a legend that the artifact was taken to Ethiopia and now resides in a local church. Evidence that the chest existed has yet to be found, but the CIA document declassified in 2000 claims it was discovered in 1988.

‘The target is a container. This container has another container inside of it,’ the document states. ‘The target is fashioned of wood, gold and silver…. and it is decorated with [a six-winged angel].’

The remote viewer continued to say that the coffin-shaped object is ‘located somewhere in the Middle East’ and saw people in the area speaking Arabic.

The remote viewer, however, was not told that they were searching for the lost covenant before the experiment began.

According to Biblical history, this sacred, gold-covered wooden chest was constructed sometime around 1445 BC.

The Ten Commandments are a list of directives given to Moses by God, including rules such as ‘thou shalt not kill’ and ‘honor thy mother and father.’

Some historians believe the Ark remained inside the ancient temple of Jerusalem for centuries, and during this time, only the High Priest of the Israelites could see it. Even he was only allowed near it on Judaism’s holiest holiday, Yom Kippur.

And then, it vanished.

But this CIA document — a remnant of the mysterious ‘Project Sun Streak’ — suggests the US government has known where the Ark is for years.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and several other intelligence agencies including the CIA employed individuals ‘alleged to have paranormal capabilities’ as means of acquiring intelligence about ‘distant events.’

Project Sun Streak attempted to use psychics known as ‘remote viewers’ to gather intelligence on targets using only coordinates.

Remote viewers are supposedly able to project their consciousness beyond their bodies to observe a far-off location.

The CIA tapped these psychics for a wide array of operations, from locating hostages kidnapped by Islamic terrorist groups to tracing the paths of fugitive criminals within the US.

The project, known as Sun Streak, has gained public attention after it was featured on a recent episode of the Ninjas are Butterflies podcast.

Show host Josh Hooper said he thought Project Sun Streak was ‘fake’ until he went on the CIA.gov website and found the document.

‘I was like… ‘what am I looking at?” he said.

The document describes a training exercise conducted on December 5, 1988.

The psychic projected their consciousness beyond their body to search for the sacred artifact, writing down his observations as they went.

‘What he wrote was bone-chilling,’ Hooper said.

‘This target is located somewhere in the Middle East as the language spoken by individuals present seemed to be Arabic,’ the psychic wrote.

The psychic described nearby buildings that resembled Mosque Domes and individuals ‘clothed in virtually all white’ with ‘black hair and dark eyes.’

‘One figure I homed in on wore a moustache,’ they wrote.

‘The target is hidden — underground, dark and wet were all aspects of the location of the target.

‘The purpose of the target is to bring a people together. It has something to do with ceremony, memory, homage, the resurrection.

‘There is an aspect of spirituality, information, lessons and historical knowledge far beyond what we now know.

‘The target is protected by entities and can only be opened (now) by those who are authorized to do so — this container will not/cannot be opened until the time is deemed correct.’

The psychic goes on to say that time comes, the ‘mechanics of the lock system will be found to be fairly simple,’ and that anyone who attempts to open the container by prying or striking will be ‘destroyed by the container’s protectors through the use of a power unknown to us.’

The rest of the report features sketches and scrawled writings that the psyching presumably made during the remote viewing session.

These include drawings of what appear to be the features of a building, a mosque with a domed top, eight ‘mummies’ lined up beside each other, a wheel and a winged-creature called a ‘seraphim.’

The document also includes multiple lists of seemingly-random but ominous words, such as ‘death,’ ‘forbidden,’ ‘protected,’ ‘scared,’ ‘destroyed,’ ‘pain’ and ‘anguish.

Some theories suggest that the Ark of the Covenant may reside somewhere inEthiopia.

Although this remote viewer claimed it is somewhere in the Middle East, this African nation is home to a large Arabic-speaking Muslim population and numerous mosques.

A long-standing religious legend in Ethiopia describes how the Ark of the Covenant was brought there by a man named Menelik, who was supposedly the son of the Queen of Sheba and Israel’s King Solomon.

The Queen of Sheba was from Ethiopia, but ruled over a kingdom in modern-day Yemen. According to legend, she gave birth to Menelik in her country of origin, but he later traveled to Jerusalem to study with his father.

While there, he supposedly stole the Ark and brought it back to Aksum, Ethiopia. Locals say it has resided in the Church of Out Lady Mary of Zion ever since.

British scholar of Semitic languages and Ethiopian studies Edward Ullendorff claimed he saw the Ark inside the church during World War II, but a source close to Ullendorff later revealed that the ‘artifact’ he saw was nothing more than a replica.

‘What he saw was what you find in any Ethiopian church, which is a model of the Ark of the Covenant,’ Tudor Parfitt, a British historian, writer and former colleague of Ullendorff, toldLive Sciencein 2018.

Apparently, Ullendorff said that ‘it didn’t differ in any way from many arks he had seen in other churches in Ethiopia,’ Parfitt said. ‘It wasn’t ancient and certainly wasn’t the original ark.’

Thus, the location of this sacred chest remains a mystery just waiting to be solved.

Bill Gates: Majority of Global Population To Become ‘Obsolete’ Within 10 Years,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/bill-gates-majority-of-global-population-to-become-obsolete-within-10-years/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"March 28, 2025","In a chilling forecast, Bill Gates, a prominent advocate for controversial population control measures, warns that within a decade, most of humanity will be rendered“useless”and“obsolete.”



During a recent interview with Jimmy Fallon on NBC’sThe Tonight Show, the globalist billionaire described a future where humans are no longer necessary“for most things”because AI technology will perform tasks that currently require human skills.

Today, expertise in fields such as medicine and education remains“rare,”Gates said, adding that those areas depend on“a great doctor”or“a great teacher.”But over the next decade,“great medical advice [and] great tutoring”will become free and commonplace, Gates said.

Gates further elaborated on this vision of a new era he terms“free intelligence”in a conversation last month with Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor known for his research on happiness.

AI technology will increasingly permeate daily life, revolutionizing areas from healthcare and diagnosis to education — with AI tutors becoming broadly available, the mogul predicted.

“It’s very profound and even a little bit scary — because it’s happening very quickly, and there is no upper bound,”Gates told Brooks.

There is considerable debate about the future roles humans will play in an AI-driven society.

While some analysts suggest AI will primarily help mankind become more productive and potentially create new economic opportunities and employment, others express concern about job stability.

Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman believes that the transformation of work by AI will have a“hugely destabilizing”impact.

In his 2023 book,“The Coming Wave,”Suleyman writes:“These tools will only temporarily augment human intelligence. They will make us smarter and more efficient for a time, and will unlock enormous amounts of economic growth, but they are fundamentally labor replacing.”

Despite acknowledging potential disruptions, Gates remains optimistic about AI’s positive contributions, including breakthroughs in medical treatments, climate solutions and widespread education.

Government Exposed Lying About Child’s ‘Measles’ Death to Push Big Pharma’s Vaccine Agenda,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/government-exposed-lying-about-childs-measles-death-to-push-big-pharmas-vaccine-agenda/,The People's Voice,Baxter Dmitry,"March 28, 2025","In late February, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) issued a chilling announcement: a 6-year-old girl from Lubbock, Texas, had become the“first death from measles”in an ongoing outbreak sweeping the South Plains and Panhandle regions.



The statement was clear, authoritative, and fit neatly into a broader narrative pushed by government health agencies—one that insists measles is a deadly scourge, conquerable only by mass vaccination.

But as the dust settles and thefamily speaks out, a very different story is emerging. What if this wasn’t a measles death at all? What if this tragedy is being exploited to prop up a pro-Big Pharma agenda?

The girl’s parents, German-speaking immigrants who broke their silence on Saturday, paint a heartbreaking picture of loss—and a damning one of medical neglect. Speaking sometimes through a translator, they insist their daughter did not die from measles. She had pneumonia, they say, and the hospital’s care was woefully inadequate.

They claim she was denied breathing treatments and life support—interventions that might have saved her life. More than a month after theDSHS announcement, they’re still awaiting an official death certificate and a definitive cause of death. The delay only fuels their suspicion that the truth is being buried.

Their account is backed by a trio of medical experts who have reviewed the hospital records. Dr. Pierre Kory, a critical care specialist with experience in medical malpractice cases, dropped a bombshell on March 25, 2025, during an appearance on CHD.TV, hosted by Children’s Health Defense.

“This girl did not die of measles by any stretch of the imagination,”Kory declared.“In fact, she died of pneumonia.”Joining him were Dr. Ben Edwards, the physician for the girl’s four surviving siblings, and Brian Hooker, Chief Scientific Officer at Children’s Health Defense. Their analysis points not just to pneumonia as the cause of death, but to something even more troubling: a fatal medical error.

“It gets worse than that,”Korycontinued.“She didn’t really die of the pneumonia; she died of a medical error, and that error was a completely inappropriate antibiotic. It was an insufficient antibiotic.”According to Kory, the hospital administered a drug that failed to address the severity of the child’s condition, effectively sealing her fate. If true, this wasn’t just a tragedy—it was preventable.

So why did the Texas DSHS rush to pin the death on measles? The answer, critics argue, lies in a broader agenda. For years, public health officials have leaned heavily on fear to drive vaccination rates, casting measles as a relentless killer despite its rarity as a fatal disease in the modern era. The push aligns seamlessly with the interests of Big Pharma, which reaps billions from vaccine mandates and an ever-expanding childhood immunization schedule.

By labeling this death a measles casualty, the government could amplify calls for compliance, drown out vaccine skeptics, and keep the profits flowing.

The family’s story raises red flags beyond the medical records. They allege their daughter was denied basic respiratory support—a charge that, if substantiated, suggests either gross incompetence or something more sinister. Were doctors pressured to let the case play out in a way that would bolster the official narrative? The lack of a death certificate only deepens the mystery, leaving room for speculation that the state is scrambling to align its story with the facts.

This isn’t the first time government health agencies have been accused of twisting data to fit a pro-vaccine script. Measles outbreaks are often met with blanket statements about the unvaccinated, even when cases involve vaccinated individuals or complications unrelated to the virus itself. In this instance, the parents haven’t disclosed their daughter’s vaccination status, but the question lingers: if she was vaccinated, would the state still blame measles—or quietly pivot to another explanation?

For now, the family grieves, caught between their loss and a system they no longer trust. The experts who’ve reviewed the case are unequivocal: this was not a measles death. Yet the DSHS has not retracted its February claim, leaving the public to wonder who’s telling the truth—and why. If Kory, Edwards, and Hooker are right, this isn’t just a misdiagnosis; it’s a cover-up, one that sacrifices a child’s memory on the altar of pharmaceutical profits and government control.

As the story unfolds, one thing is clear: the push to vaccinate every child“to the gills,”as critics put it, relies on narratives like these. But when those narratives crumble under scrutiny, what’s left is a stark question: how many more lies are we being told?

Moscow: UK & France Assisted Ukraine In Latest Attack On Russian Energy Infrastructure,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/moscow-uk-france-assisted-ukraine-in-latest-attack-on-russian-energy-infrastructure/,The People's Voice,Niamh Harris,"March 28, 2025","The Russian Foreign Ministry has claimed that Britain and France actively aided Ukraine in a strike on the Sudzha pipeline infrastructure in Russia’s Kursk Region on Friday.



According to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, the guidance and targeting of the strikes were conducted using French satellite systems, while UK specialists provided the coordinate input and carried out the launch.

RTreports: Earlier the Russian Defense Ministry said that a metering facility was“de facto destroyed”in a Ukrainian HIMARS attack.

“[We] have reasons to believe that targeting and navigation were facilitated through French satellites and British specialists input [target] coordinates and launched [the missiles],”Zakharova said, commenting on the strike.

“The command came from London,”she said, branding the attack part of a Ukrainian“terror”campaign targeting Russian energy infrastructure. The spokeswoman added that such actions demonstrate that Kiev is“impossible to negotiate with.”

Although Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky“publicly supported”a temporary suspension of strikes on energy infrastructure agreed by Moscow and Washington, he“did nothing to observe it,”according to Zakharova.

Moscow ordered that attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure cease on March 18, following a phone call between presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Russia and the US also agreed on a list of energy facilities that should not be targeted as part of a truce earlier this week. The list included gas facilities.

Kiev also agreed to a US-proposed 30-day partial ceasefire following talks between Ukrainian and American delegations in Saudi Arabia on March 15. Zelensky hailed the development and even described it as a diplomatic“victory”for Ukraine, but did not publicly mention any relevant orders to the Ukrainian military.

The Russian Defense Ministry has regularly reported on Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy infrastructure over the past few weeks. Earlier on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists that the strike suggested that the Ukrainian military no longer follows Kiev’s orders due to a“total lack of supervision.”

Paris and London have emerged as the staunchest supporters of Ukraine in the face of a gradual shift in Washington’s position under the new Trump administration. In early March, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said that their nations were ready to lead a“coalition of the willing”—a group of pro-Ukrainian countries prepared to support Kiev with troops and aircraft.

Russia has vehemently rejected any possibility of NATO-aligned European troops deploying to the conflict zone. It has accused France and Britain of hatching plans for“military intervention in Ukraine,”which could lead to a direct armed clash between Russia and NATO.

He said that NATO member states viewed the Arctic as a “bridgehead” for future conflicts and is actively training troops to operate in the far north.

Putin also urged the world to takeTrump’s Greenland plansseriously

RTreports: The number of Russian forces deployed in the Arctic is bound to grow to meet the growing challenges there, Putin said.

“We are, of course, concerned by the fact that NATO countries as a whole are more frequently designating the far north as a bridgehead for possible conflicts, practicing the use of troops in these conditions, including their new recruits from Finland and Sweden,”he declared.

Moscow has been“closely monitoring”the situation in the region, and has taken“an adequate response approach by increasing the combat capabilities of the armed forces and modernizing military infrastructure facilities,”the president explained.

“I would like to emphasize that Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic,”he said, adding that Russia will not tolerate any encroachments on its sovereignty and will“reliably protect”its national interests.

Maintaining“peace and stability”in the Arctic is the key to the long-term development of the region, in addition to“improvement of the quality of life of people and preservation of the unique natural environment,”Putin said.

“The stronger our positions are, the more significant the results will be,”he stressed.

Russia’s strong posture in the Arctic gives more opportunities to“launch global international projects”there with the participation of“friendly nations,”and potentially with Western states as well.“Should they, of course, show interest in working together, and I am sure that the time for such projects will definitely come,”the president stated.

WEF Stooge Mark Carney Vows to ‘Sever All Ties with U.S.’,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/wef-stooge-mark-carney-vows-to-sever-all-ties-with-u-s/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 28, 2025","Mark Carney, Canada’s new Prime Minister and WEF Young Global Leader, has vowed to sever all ties with the United States. In a stunning declaration, he proclaimed the end of the nation’s historic relationship with its southern neighbor, setting the stage for a dramatic shift in policy.



Taking office without ever facing voters, the former central banker has quickly distanced Canada from its largest trading partner and closest ally. Carney, known for his globalist affiliations, is now pivoting toward European elites while pushing a bold, controversial overhaul of the Canadian economy—moves that have already sparked alarm among critics and U.S. officials alike.

Thegatewaypundit.comreports: Carney’s announcement came Thursday during a press conference in Ottawa, where he railed against Trump’s “permanent” 25% tariffs on Canadian vehicles and auto parts, calling them a “very direct attack” on Canadian workers.

Carney:Our biggest challenge as a country is becoming the most urgent. Over the coming weeks, months, and years, we must fundamentally reimagine our economy. We will need to ensure that Canada can succeed in a drastically different world.

The old relationship we had with the United States—based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation—is over.

What exactly the United States does next is unclear. But what is clear is that we, as Canadians, have agency. We have power. We are masters in our own home.

We can control our destiny. We can give ourselves much more than any foreign government, including the United States, can ever take away. We can deal with this crisis best by building our strength right here at home.

It will take hard work. It will take steady focus and determination—from governments, from businesses, from labor, from Canadians. We will need to dramatically reduce our reliance on the United States.

We will need to pivot our trade relationships elsewhere, and we will need to do things previously thought impossible, at speeds we haven’t seen in generations.

But we can make ourselves more productive—and therefore more competitive. We can break down internal trade barriers. We can build a stronger and more resilient economy. That’s what I’m squarely focused on as your Prime Minister.

WATCH:

Carney’s declaration comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s imposition of a 25% tariff on auto imports.

President Trump on Wednesday adjusted tariffs on foreign-made cars to impose 25% tariffs on “imported passenger vehicles (sedans, SUVs, crossovers, minivans, cargo vans) and light trucks, as well as key automobile parts (engines, transmissions, powertrain parts, and electrical components), with processes to expand tariffs on additional parts if necessary.”

This comes as the President’s executive order, which will impose sweeping reciprocal tariffs on every country that charges the United States taxes or tariffs on imported goods, is scheduled to take effect on April 2. The White House and President Trump have repeatedly referred to April 2 as “Liberation Day.”

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Ford made his intentions clear, signaling a bold escalation in the cross-border conflict.



“We’re going to ensure we hit the American people as hard as we can without hurting Canadians,” Ford stated during the press conference. His remarks come as tensions over trade policies continue to strain relations between Ontario, Canada’s economic powerhouse, and the U.S., with both sides digging in for a prolonged battle.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says he wants to “inflict as much pain as possible” on the American peoplepic.twitter.com/rKZTj3Xpwe

Infowars.comreports: The menacing comment came in response to Trump announcing a new 25% tariff Wednesday on cross-border auto trade.

Ford said he was caught off guard by the tariff which could impact all vehicles imported into the U.S. from Canada beginning on April 3.

The Ontario premier suggested U.S. vehicle costs will dramatically increase due to the tariffs, adding, “I know President Trump likes telling people ‘you’re fired.’ I didn’t think he meant auto workers in the U.S. when he said that.”

Again threatening the American public, Ford said, “We just aren’t going to roll over. We’re going to retaliate and he’s going to feel the pain from the American people.”

However, this isn’t the first time the politician has talked tough when it comes to the tariff war.

Earlier this month, Ford quickly buckled by suspending a 25% tax on electricity exported to the U.S. just hours after POTUS hiked Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs.

Before he caved, the Canadian “progressive conservative” threatened to shut off electricity to several U.S. states completely.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford warns: “If the US escalates, I will not hesitate to shut the electricity off completely.”Canada is now openly threatening to cut power to the U.S.pic.twitter.com/o8G3iGmUt7

All it took was a strongly worded Truth Social post by Trump to get Ford to come to his senses.

Perhaps the master negotiator Donald Trump will again force Ford to his knees after boldly stating he’ll intentionally inflict pain on the American people.

She said Italy’s troops would no be joining the military force that the UK and France want to deploy to Ukraine in the event that a peace deal is reached with Russia.

Earlier this month, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron said that their countries were ready to lead a so called “coalition of the willing” pro-Ukrainian European countries to support Kiev with troops and aircraft.

RTreports: The announcement followed the launch of bilateral talks between Moscow and Washington to settle the ongoing conflict, to which the EU and UK were not invited.

After a summit of Kiev’s backers in Paris on Thursday, which was attended by Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky, Meloni reiterated that“no national participation in a possible military force on the ground is planned”by the authorities in Rome.

According to a statement published by the Italian prime minister’s office, she also“stressed the importance of continuing to work with the US to stop the conflict and achieve peace”between Moscow and Kiev. She“hoped for the involvement of an American delegation at the next coordination meeting”of Ukraine’s European allies, the statement read.

In her interview with the Financial Times on Friday, Meloni stressed that it is“childish”to make Italy choose between the US and the EU.

Instead of deploying what London and Paris now call a“reassurance force”to aid Kiev, she proposed extending NATO’s mutual defense clause to Ukraine without actually making the country a member of the US-led bloc. Doing so would be“easier and more effective than the other ideas that are on the table,”she insisted.

Croatian President Zoran Milanovic also said on Thursday that his country“will not be involved in Ukraine in any form.”Zagreb will not join the peacekeeping force because“the necessary conditions are simply not met – there is no peace agreement, nor the consent of the other side, which in this case is Russia,”he explained.

Russia has categorically ruled out the possibility of NATO-aligned European troops deploying to the conflict zone. It accused France and Britain of hatching plans for“military intervention in Ukraine,”which could lead to a direct military clash between Russia and the bloc. Moscow also suggested that London and Paris are deliberately escalating tensions in order to undermine efforts by the US and Russia to resolve the conflict.

Zelensky made the remarks during an interview with European broadcasters on Wednesday.

RT reports: He accused Witkoff, a key official in opening negotiations on resolving the Ukraine conflict, of taking Moscow’s side and“helping”Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I believe that Witkoff really does quote Kremlin narratives very often. I believe that this will not bring us closer to peace. And I believe that, unfortunately, this will weaken the American pressure on Russia. We can only fix this information backdrop through our actions. We’re trying to do that,”Zelensky stated.

“Witkoff’s statements are very much a hindrance to us, because we are fighting Putin and we really do not want him to have many helpers,”he added.

Zelensky was apparently referring to remarks made by Witkoff in a recent interview with American journalist Tucker Carlson, during which the special envoy spoke about the status of former Ukrainian territories that have joined Russia, describing the issue as“an elephant in the room”that“no one wants to talk about.”

New Department for Work and Pensions data show the number of impoverished children soared by 100,000 in the year to March 2024, an increase from 4.33 million the previous year.

This means that 31 per cent of children in the UK are living in poverty and 72 per cent of these live in households with working families.

TheMail Onlinereports: It comes just a day after Labour announced a policy that its own impact as sessment suggested will plunge a further 50,000 children into poverty.

A child is defined as living in poverty if their household earns below 60 per cent of the UK median income after housing costs – equating to £22,500.

There are 14.6 million children living in the UK, according to the DWP, with the latest figures showing the highest number of children living in poverty since records began in 2002.

Save the Children UK branded the increase a ‘source of national shame’ and warned Labour it risked overseeing a huge increase in child poverty.

The charity’s director Dan Paskins said: ‘These figures are a source of national shame. The rise in child poverty to 4.5 million – the highest figure on record – is a direct consequence of political choices.

‘The government must take immediate action to ensure more children do not fall into poverty next year. If they don’t, this could be the first Labour government that oversees a significant rise in child poverty – a record no one wants.’

It comes as Rachel Reeves said that she is ‘absolutely certain’ her welfare reforms will not push more people into poverty.

The Chancellor appeared to reject an official impact assessment which suggested that 250,000 people – including 50,000 children – could fall into poverty as a result of the changes.

‘I am absolutely certain that our reforms, instead of pushing people into poverty, are going to get people into work,’ she told Sky News.

‘And we know that if you move from welfare into work, you are much less likely to be in poverty.

‘That is our ambition, making people better off, not making people worse off, and also the welfare state will always be there for people who genuinely need it.’

However there is a growing rebellion among Labour backbenchers over the changes and today charities urged the Chancellor to U-turn on the plans.

The document doesn’t mince words.“Europe is facing a new reality marred with risk and uncertainty,”it declares, painting a dystopian vision of a continent under siege. Russia’s aggression isn’t a distant rumble anymore—it’s a battering ram at the gates. Critical infrastructure is being targeted, cyberattacks are escalating, and geopolitical tensions are a lit fuse waiting to blow. The EU Commission isn’t asking citizens to prepare out of caution; it’s a desperate plea to survive the opening salvo of a conflict they see hurtling toward them.

And it’s not just Russia keeping EU leaders awake at night. Across the Atlantic, Trump’s America has turned from ally to antagonist, leaving Europe to pay its own bills. The result? A frantic scramble to arm up, shore up defenses, and ready the population for a world where self-reliance isn’t optional—it’s the only lifeline left.

The EU’s survival blueprint is as practical as it is terrifying. Every household must hoard enough supplies to weather three days of chaos—food, water, medicine, blankets, batteries, the works.“In the case of extreme disruptions, the initial period is the most critical,”the document warns. Translation: when the bombs drop or the lights go out, you’re on your own. Emergency services won’t save you; your neighbors won’t share. The EU wants you psychologically steeled for a nightmare where society frays and survival hinges on what’s stashed in your basement.

This isn’t about weathering a storm—it’s about enduring the collapse of everything Europe has taken for granted. The Commission even wants“preparedness”drilled into schoolkids, teaching them to spot disinformation and steel their minds against the propaganda wars already raging. It’s a generation being groomed not for peace, but for battle.

Here’s the kicker: EU leaders aren’t just reacting—they’re orchestrating. Germany’s updated war plans last June, unveiled by Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, laid bare the bloc’s mindset: arm up or be crushed. Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission’s steely president, doubled down Wednesday, insisting that“new realities require a new level of preparedness.”But her words drip with more than urgency—they hint at intent. Why else push this hard, this fast, unless they’re not just fearing war but preparing to wage it?

The EU’s rhetoric screams inevitability. They’re not rallying for peace talks or de-escalation—they’re stockpiling, militarizing, and conditioning citizens for carnage. The Trump factor only fuels the fire, giving Brussels the perfect excuse to flex its muscles and rally the bloc under a banner of “resilience.” It’s almost as if they’re daring Russia—or anyone else—to make the first move.

For the average European, this is a gut punch. Gone are the days of carefree summers and borderless dreams. Now it’s canned goods, flashlights, and a crash course in self-preservation. The EU’s 72-hour mandate isn’t a suggestion—it’s a warning that the first three days of hell will decide who lives and who doesn’t. And behind it all, leaders in Brussels seem less like reluctant guardians and more like architects of a war they’ve already accepted as their legacy.

So, stock up, Europe. Your leaders see the storm coming—and they’re ready to ride it, no matter the cost. The question is: are you?

As the players fled and the cameras rolled, her t-shirt proudly blared the group’s name, setting the scene for a countdown website that popped up days later, ticking ominously toward a mysterious 10pm deadline tonight.

Alizée clung to the center court net until security pried her loose, but not before her sticky stunt seared itself into the public’s mind. Millions worldwide took note, pledging to watch that ticking doomsday clock—and to call out the climate crusaders when their latest apocalyptic forecast inevitably flops.

At the time of writing, theticking clock reads:’0 days. 10 hours. 55 minutes. 20 seconds.’

This is 10pm tonight.

Here we are on March 27, 2025, and—imagine my shock—the world hasn’t ended.

Rénovation’s doomsday timer hit zero, and the only thing that collapsed was the latest in a long line of climate predictions that couldn’t predict rain in a monsoon.

Alizée’s gluey grandstand is just another footnote in the flop parade led by the likes of Greta Thunberg, Al Gore, and Bill Gates—self-appointed prophets of gloom who’ve been swinging and missing since dial-up was a thing.

Maybe it’s time to unstick ourselves from the hysteria, let the world keep turning, and admit their track record’s so shaky it couldn’t hold up a house of cards.

Her death marks the latest in a chilling string of suicides among the department’s ranks, with three other deputies succumbing to the same fate since early February—fueling whispers of a deeper, darker mystery festering within the force.

Yahooreports: The president of the Harris County Deputies Organization, Jose Lopez, said that he and his fellow officers are currently processing the situation.

“It caught a lot of us by surprise,”Lopez said.“One is too many. Two? Three? Yes, it’s definitely devastating.”

Houston Police Officers’ Union president, Douglas Griffith, told the outlet that suicide risks are 54 percent higher for those in law enforcement.

In its post confirming Kohler’s death, HCSO reiterated that mental health support was available for colleagues.

Three days after Kohler was found, it was also announced that former Harris County deputy Maria Vasquez, who left the department in December, also died by suicide.

Earlier last week, another former deputy, William Bozeman, was found dead under similar circumstances. Former deputy Long Nguyen, 58, also took his own life on February 6, according to the medical examiner.

“It hits very close to home and it’s a reminder to us how fragile life is and it’s also a reminder we do need to look out for each other. We do need to take care of each other,”Lopez said.

Dr Thomas McNeese, the director of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office Behavioral Health Division told KHOU 11 that the past few weeks had been“difficult for our staff and the sheriff’s office as a whole.”

This week, when directly asked how many children he molested on Epstein’s infamous island, a visibly rattled Carney stumbled into a strange, trance-like recitation of what some described as a Satanic mantra, leaving onlookers stunned and his composure in tatters.

Carney, the former head of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, is facing serious allegations from whistleblowers from his past. They say the global elite have compromising information on him—even worse than Justin Trudeau’s scandals—that keeps him under their control.

Carney’s career is well-documented: he worked at Goldman Sachs, led two major central banks, and became a key figure at the World Economic Forum. He’s known to associate with figures like Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.

Now, some say Carney’s been tapped to lead Canada—not through an election, but by WEF influence, replacing one controversial figure with another. A former colleague claims this fits a pattern of elite maneuvering.

But new revelations suggest a darker side.

Photos from 2013 show Carney and his wife Diana socialising with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s child procurer convicted for her role in his trafficking network, at a UK event.

Carney and his wife have also appeared on Epstein’s flight logs according to insiders, including flights to Little Saint James, the island central to Epstein’s crimes. Insiders allege they weren’t just acquaintances but participants. Watch:

The story’s too hot, too dangerous—leaving even the most fearless pundits second-guessing whether they dare wade into this cesspool of power and corruption.

This isn’t just an investigation grinding through the gears of justice—it’s a full-scale battle. A relentless war pitting courageous investigators against a sprawling international child trafficking network, orchestrated by the untouchable elite pulling strings in the shadows

Hunter Biden, Ellen DeGeneres, Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey—they’re all in the crosshairs, and the evidence is undeniable.

Millions of children vanish every year—millions—swallowed by these networks, their fates worse than your darkest nightmares. But the tide’s turning. From Cape Town to Ukraine and D.C. to Hollywood, the hunters are becoming the hunted.

It’s not just an elite conspiracy—it’s their Achilles heel. Their weak link that’ll bring the elite’s fragile empire crashing to the ground. No tinfoil hats here—just the brutal truth that cracks their game wide open.

Once the masses see the elite for what they are, it’s over. They’ll be ripped from their penthouses, dragged through the streets—from Hollywood and D.C., to Europe’s exclusive enclaves, to the hellholes they plunder for profit and fresh meat.

Justice won’t just knock; it’ll kick the door down.

And who’s exposing this conspiracy to the world? We are. We exposed Epstein’s depravity while the mainstream cowered. We dropped Pizzagate—cracked the pedophile code words in Podesta’s emails—while everyone else choked on their own lies. We called out the Diddy list, named names, without fear, while the rest of the world trembled.

And we’ve been proven right, about every single thing, every damn time.

Now, we’ve got the unfiltered truth about the adrenochrome network and how it’s reorganizing itself in the face of unprecedented opposition.

But this is dynamite—names, locations, hard proof. The kind that gets you silenced. Three-letter spooks, elite string-pullers, compromised politicians—they’re sweating bullets right now. They’ll kill this if they can.

Thelawsuit states:

This suit stems from Defendants’ years-long scheme to personally and improperly profit from NDC’s donations, staffing, resources, name, platform, and trademarks.

Defendants have misappropriated donor funds in numerous ways, including by unilaterally paying themselves large salaries, paying themselves as contractors, and paying non-NDC entities money that was then earmarked for the Defendants.

Defendants Kennedy, deGroot, and Valenciano created an unapproved scheme to pay themselves more money in the form of “back pay,” even though NDC never approved a deferred compensation program for them.

Defendants Kennedy, deGroot, and Valenciano unilaterally decided that they were owed almost $3 million in “back pay,” and then paid themselves more than $1 million of donor funds.

Thegatewaypundit.comreports: The filing added that the trio’s actions “gives rise to criminal liability… at a minimum, a third degree felony.”

Despite the severe allegations, Kennedy remains a prominent and respected figure in Democratic circles and willnext month hold a conferencefeaturing Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.

According to hisLinkedInpage, Kennedy is motivated by “an unwavering passion for people and works to ensure that all individuals receive equal opportunities in the workplace regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.”

Meanwhile, the NDCdescribes itselfas “dedicated to fostering diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) across all sectors of society.”

”By promoting dialogue, education, and collaboration, NDC seeks to build a more inclusive world where everyone has the opportunity to succeed regardless of their background,” the organization’s website states.

It claims to have a “robust network of 50 state councils and 40 city councils under its umbrella.”

The website features images of Kennedy meeting and holding forums with the likes of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Over recent years, Americans have come to realize DEI schemes and initiatives are designed to reduce the influence and power of white men while also enriching those who run them.

Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has aggressively cracked down on DEI across the federal government.

Scientists Confirm Vaccine Shedding Is Fueling Measles Outbreak in Texas,https://thepeoplesvoice.tv/scientists-confirm-vaccine-shedding-is-fueling-measles-outbreak-in-texas/,The People's Voice,Sean Adl-Tabatabai,"March 27, 2025","Scientists have confirmed that vaccine shedding is fueling a measles outbreak in Texas, where cases have soared to 309 in early 2025, surpassing the 285 reported across the U.S. in all of 2024. This surge coincides with a push for more MMR vaccines.



Despite administering anadditional 15,000 doses statewide, Texas public health officials are grappling with a counterintuitive crisis. The explanation lies in long-overlooked research: the measles vaccine can, in rare instances, transmit the virus. As infections climb, this phenomenon—seldom highlighted in mainstream discourse—has thrust the state into an unprecedented public health dilemma.

Naturalnews.comreports:  A 1995 CDC study published in theJournal of Clinical Microbiologydetected measles virus RNA in the urine of 83% of vaccinated children for up to two weeks after receiving the MMR shot. The researchers, led by Paul A. Rota, noted that viral shedding began as early as one day post-vaccination and persisted in some cases for 14 days. Similar findings were replicated in a 2024 Journal of Clinical Virology study, which identified shedding for 29 days in recently immunized individuals. This raises a critical question: Could aggressive vaccination campaigns inadvertently amplify community transmission?

“The vaccine virus is alive, replicating, and excreted,” explains Dr. Suzanne Humphries, a nephrologist and vaccine researcher. “When you inject a live virus into a person, especially someone immunocompromised, that virus can escape into the environment.”

Compounding the issue is the MMR vaccine’s design. A 2016 study inThe Journal of Infectious Diseasesrevealed that the vaccine’s Edmonston strain was engineered through gain-of-function (GOF) techniques to bind CD46—a receptor found on nearly all human nucleated cells. Wild measles primarily targets CD150, a marker on immune cells.

Original (Wild-Type) Measles Virus (Montefiore 89 Strain):

The naturally occurring measles virus primarily infects immune cells by binding to the CD150 receptor.

Lab-Modified (Vaccine) Strain (Edmonston Strain):

In contrast, the vaccine strain has been altered in the lab to gain the ability to bind CD46—a receptor found on nearly all nucleated human cells and present in much higher abundance than CD150. Because of this engineered adaptation, the vaccine strain of measles virus has the potential to enter a broader range of cells compared to the wild-type virus, due to its expanded receptor usage.

This manipulation means the vaccine virus can infect a broader range of tissues than its natural counterpart. Combined with prolonged shedding, the risk of vaccine-derived transmission escalates—particularly among the unvaccinated or those with weakened immunity.

Gaines County, Texas, saw a 242% spike in measles cases after a health district distributed free MMR vaccines in early 2024. Now, with statewide cases soaring, health officials admit the outbreak is likely under-counted and expected to worsen.

Historical context sharpens the concern:

1966:Measles antigen was detected in vaccinated individuals’ urine for 16 days post-injection.

1995:CDC confirmed viral RNA shedding in children.

2024:Peer-reviewed studiesextended the shedding window to 29 days.

However, with vaccine shedding well known for decades, public health messaging continues to blame the unvaccinated, ignoring the vaccine’s own role in viral spread. With measles dominating headlines in 2025, the Texas outbreak forces a uncomfortable debate: Are we trading short-term “herd immunity” for long-term viral persistence? As vaccine-derived cases mount, the medical establishment faces a dilemma—one that echoes the early days of polio, where the vaccine itself seeded outbreaks.

“When you vaccinate millions,” warns biologist Dr. Stephanie Seneff, “you’re conducting an uncontrolled experiment on the whole population.”

Will health agencies finally confront the evidence—or will the cycle of outbreaks and boosters continue indefinitely?

But then Gates added “with AI, over the next decade, that will become free, commonplace…great medical advice, great tutoring”

CNBCreports: In other words, the world is entering a new era of what Gates called “free intelligence” in aninterview last monthwith Harvard University professor and happiness expert Arthur Brooks. The result will be rapid advances in AI-powered technologies that are accessible and touch nearly every aspect of our lives,Gates has said, from improved medicines and diagnoses to widely availableAI tutorsandvirtual assistants.

“It’s very profound and even a little bit scary — because it’s happening very quickly, and there is no upper bound,” Gates told Brooks.

The debate over how, exactly, most humans will fit into this AI-powered future is ongoing.Some experts sayAI will help humans work more efficiently — rather than replacing them altogether — and spur economic growth that leads to more jobs being created.

Others, likeMicrosoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman, counter that continued technological advancements over the next several years will change what most jobs look like across nearly every industry, and have a “hugely destabilizing” impact on the workforce.

“These tools will only temporarily augment human intelligence,” Suleyman wrote in his book “The Coming Wave,” which was published in 2023. “They will make us smarter and more efficient for a time, and will unlock enormous amounts of economic growth, but they are fundamentally labor replacing.”

Gates isoptimisticabout the overall benefits AI can provide to humanity, like “breakthrough treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions for climate change, and high-quality education for everyone,”he wrotelast year.

Talking to Fallon, Gates reaffirmed his belief that certain types of jobs will likely never be replaced by AI, noting that people probably don’t want to see machines playing baseball, for example.

“There will be some things we reserve for ourselves. But in terms of making things and moving things and growing food, over time those will be basically solved problems,” Gates said.

RTreports: Theincidentoccurred on March 15 during mass protests in the capital, Belgrade, which the government has claimed are foreign-instigated efforts to undermine its authority through popular unrest.

In an interview with RTS on Wednesday, Vulin rejected the claims that LRAD had been deployed and announced that specialists from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) will arrive in Serbia to conduct an inquiry.

“Their task is to clarify what transpired. We have nothing to conceal,”Vulin stated, emphasizing Belgrade’s commitment to a thorough investigation in hopes of moving beyond the controversy.

President Aleksandar Vucic’s government has alleged that the US“deep state”and European intelligence agencies are inciting the wave of protests in retaliation for Serbia’s refusal to endorse anti-Russian policies. The EU has insisted that Belgrade align its foreign policy with Brussels, before a Serbian bid to join the bloc could proceed.

The ongoing protests stem from a tragic event in Novi Sad last November, where 16 lives were lost due to the collapse of a concrete canopy at a railway station, leading to multiple resignations among senior officials.

The demonstration on March 15 represented the peak of the pressure campaign. Claims of the“sonic weapon”deployment were propagated by the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy (BCSP), a USAID-funded NGO supported by George Soros’ Open Society Foundations.

Zhovkva made his appeal ahead of a Paris summit for the “coalition of the willing” countries that are ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine.

He said:“We need serious, trained troops… who are ready to fight“.

RTreports: The official clarified that Kiev is not seeking European forces to engage directly with Russian troops but rather to bolster Ukraine’s defensive capabilities.

“We are not talking about soldiers who will fight with Russia… but about those who will defend, who will deter,”he said.

Led by France and the United Kingdom, the coalition’s discussions have included the potential deployment of a 30,000-strong“reassurance”force to secure key cities, ports, and infrastructure, as well as air-policing missions.

Moscow has previously warned that the deployment of NATO military personnel to Ukraine – even with the stated purpose of peacekeeping – would constitute direct involvement of NATO countries in a war against Russia. Moscow has also accused France and the UK of deliberately escalating tensions in Ukraine to undermine efforts to resolve the conflict by the US and Russia.

However, the composition and mandate of such a force remain under debate. While some EU leaders advocate a robust military presence capable of engaging in combat if necessary, others express reservations about escalating the conflict. Germany and Poland, for instance, have shown reluctance, emphasizing the need for defensive support without direct involvement in combat operations.

Washington’s position further complicates the situation. US President Donald Trump’s administration has rejected committing American troops, focusing instead on diplomatic efforts to broker a ceasefire. This has led some EU nations to consider taking greater responsibility for Ukraine’s security, with French President Emmanuel Macron stating that Europe must“step up”its commitments.

But MIT’s Bill Gates-funded injection could offer years of birth control with just one shot.

Interestng engineeringreports: MIT engineers have developed a new, less painful drug delivery system using injectable crystal suspensions. These crystals form a long-lasting “depot” under the skin, releasing medication over months or years, and reducing the need for frequent injections.

“We showed that we can have very controlled, sustained delivery, likely for multiple months and even years through a small needle,” said Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.

This research focuses on developing improved contraceptive options for women, especially in developing nations.

Some injectable suspensions exist, but they are short-acting. Other long-lasting injectable depots require high concentrations of polymers, making them difficult to inject. This new development aims to address these limitations.

The objective was to produce a drug delivery system that could be administered via a thin needle and provide sustained release for six months to two years.

For the development, the team used levonorgestrel, a crystal-forming contraceptive.

It was found that suspending it in biocompatible benzyl benzoate solvent allowed the crystals to form a compact, long-lasting implant after injection. This acted like a self-assembling drug depot under the skin.

The researchers discovered that the solvent’s inability to mix with bodily fluids is key for the drugcrystalsto clump together and form a long-lasting drug reservoir (depot) beneath the skin post-injection.

This method enables easier injection through a thin needle.

“The solvent is critical because it allows you to inject the fluid through a small needle, but once in place, the crystals self-assemble into a drug depot,” Traverso added.

The mistake was as simple as it was devastating. The BCG, typically given to newborns, contains live Mycobacterium bovis bacteria, a weakened strain tied to cattle TB. It’s meant to be injected just under the skin, triggering a controlled immune response.

But this time, it was jabbed into her muscle—the standard method for MMR—letting the bacteria run rampant in her deltoid. The result: a festering abscess oozing pus, weeks of misdiagnosis, and a stark reminder that even“safe”vaccines can turn deadly.

Doctors initially chalked up the swelling to inflamed skin tissue, but tests later confirmed TB-causing bacteria in her body.

“Administration of the BCG vaccine intramuscularly is commonly the result of an error and can lead to rare and preventable complications, even in immunocompetent patients,”the case report stated. The doctors blamed a mix-up:“A reasonable explanation is that the healthcare professional confused the [TB vaccine] for the MMR vaccine.”

That confusion carried a heavy toll. While MMR uses viruses that replicate slowly in muscle to build immunity, BCG’s bacteria need tight control under the skin. Unleashed in her muscle, they spread unchecked, sparking an infection that medical literature calls rare—hitting one to ten percent of recipients—with effects ranging from blisters to life-threatening lesions in the lungs, liver, or spleen.

For her, it meant an abscess that lingered for months, only shrinking after three months of anti-TB drugs.

After six months of hell, she was declared fully recovered, with“no further symptoms,”doctors said.

But the damage was done—and the implications linger. Severe BCG complications are usually seen in babies or the immunocompromised, not healthy adults like her.

“A healthy immunocompetent adult, in contrast to the cases in the literature,”the report noted, published in theAmerican Journal of Case Reports.
