Decision day in court for Marine Le Pen's French presidential hopes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn91lzrrx2qo,BBC,Hugh Schofield,30-03-25,"France's Marine Le Pen faces a make-or-break moment on Monday, as a judge rules on whether she should be banned from the next presidential election.

The far-right leader, who is ahead of all her rivals in the 2027 race, will be in court at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST) for the verdict of aparty-funding trial targeting her National Rally (RN) party.

At the trial's conclusion in November, the state prosecutor demanded guilty verdicts for Le Pen and 24 others accused of using EU parliamentary money to pay party salaries.

But to general surprise the prosecutor also said that Le Pen's punishment should be not just a €300,000 (£250,000) fine and prison term, but alsoineligibility from running for public office for five years.

Crucially, he said the ineligibility should kick in straightaway – and not be suspended pending the appeal that Marine Le Pen is expected to file if convicted.

The three judges are not obliged to follow the prosecutor's recommendations.

But if they do, it would mean Le Pen, who is 56, being barred fromstanding in a presidential electionin which she is tipped as a potential winner.

""It's my political death they are after,"" she said in November.

Many French commentators – and not only those who support Le Pen – have warned of grave consequences for democracy if the judiciary is seen as interfering in the choice of the country's leader.

""The justice system has the fate of Marine Le Pen in its hands… For her to be convicted for any wrong-doing is perfectly normal. But stopping her from running in the presidential [election] - that's another matter entirely,"" wrote veteran analyst Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the centre-right Le Point magazine.

""Is it not hazardous - not to say perilous - to give to judges the task of determining whether this or that candidate has the capacity to run for office?"" said Bruno Jeudi, editor of La Tribune Dimanche newspaper on Sunday.

Marine Le Pen told the same newspaper: ""Personally I'm not nervous.  But I can see why people think I might be. The judges have the power of life or death over the movement.  But I don't think they will go so far as to do it.""

Various scenarios for the verdict are under scrutiny.

First, Le Pen could be cleared of blame in the EU parliamentary money affair. This is widely seen as unlikely.

Second, the judges could convict her but make the ineligibility not automatic. In that case, she would immediately appeal and the ineligibility would not apply until after a second trial (and conceivably a third to the high court of appeal).

That would leave her free to run in 2027, though with the handicap of a conviction for misuse of public money. However it is far from clear that a conviction would do her cause much damage, given the series of party funding scandals that have affected all French parties over the years.

Third, the judges could follow the prosecutor and order automatic ineligibility. In this case she would appeal, and the other parts of the sentence (fine and prison) would be suspended. However she would be unable to run in 2027.

Fourth, the court could give her a shorter term of automatic ineligibility - say one year - making it theoretically possible for her to run.

2027 would be Marine Le Pen's fourth presidential race, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory.

A poll in the right-wing newspaper JDD Sunday gave her between 34-37% of the first round vote, well ahead of any of her possible rivals.

In the last two presidentials, she fell foul of the two-round system which allowed opponents of left, centre and right torally behind a single candidate – Emmanuel Macron – to keep her from power.

But years of ""detoxification"" after she eclipsed her father Jean-Marie Le Pen at the head of the party have made the anti-RN vote far less cohesive than it used to be, while victories for the far-right in other countries have helped lift the taboo of an RN government.

If Le Pen is barred from running, her logical replacement would be Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old party president who was being groomed to be her eventual prime minister.

However party insiders admit there has been little internal preparation for what would be widely seen as a huge and destabilising political earthquake.

One result of Le Pen being declared unable to run in 2027 could be to weaken still further the minority French government of Prime Minister François Bayrou. With 120 members in the National Assembly, the RN has the power to vote with the left in avote of no-confidence to bring the government down.

Until now, Marine Le Pen has held back her troops. She might feel less inclined to,  if she feels she has been the victim of an establishment stitch-up.

Germany decides to leave history in the past and prepare for war,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjyjlkewr2o,BBC,Sarah Rainsford,31-03-25,"A missile launcher sends a cloud of brown dust into the air as it hurtles across a field towards the firing line. Moments later comes a soldier's countdown, from five to 'Fire!', before a rocket roars into the sky.

The blasts and booms from such military training exercises are so constant that locals in the nearby small town of Munster barely notice anymore.

But life here is set to get even louder.

Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, recently got the all-clear for a massive increase in investment after parliament voted to exempt defence spending from strict rules on debt.

The country's top general has told the BBC the cash boost is urgently needed because he believes Russian aggression won't stop at Ukraine.

""We are threatened by Russia. We are threatened by Putin. We have to do whatever is needed to deter that,"" Gen Carsten Breuer says. He warns that Nato should be braced for a possible attack in as little as four years.

""It's not about how much time I need, it's much more about how much time Putin gives us to be prepared,"" the defence chief says bluntly. ""And the sooner we are prepared the better.""

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has changed thinking in Germany profoundly.

For decades people here have been raised on a rejection of military might, acutely aware of Germany's past role as the aggressor in Europe.

""We started two world wars. Even though it's 80 years since World War Two ended, the idea that Germans should stay out of conflict is still very much in many people's DNA,"" explains Markus Ziener of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.

Some remain wary of anything that might be seen as militarism even now, and the armed forces have been chronically underfunded.

""There are voices cautioning: 'Are we really on the right track? Is our threat perception right?'""

When it comes to Russia, Germany has had a specific approach.

Whilst countries like Poland and the Baltic States cautioned against getting too close to Moscow – and increased their own defence spending – Berlin under former Chancellor Angela Merkel believed in doing business.

Germany imagined it was delivering democratisation by osmosis. But Russia took the cash and invaded Ukraine anyway.

So in February 2022 a stunned Chancellor Olaf Scholz declared a national pivot in priorities, a ""Zeitenwende"".

That's when he committed a giant €100 billion ($108bn; £83bn) to boost the country's military and keep ""warmongers like Putin"" in check. But General Breuer says it wasn't enough.

""We filled up a little bit the potholes,"" he recounts. ""But it's really bad.""

By contrast, he points to heavy spending in Russia on weapons and equipment, for stocks as well as the frontline in Ukraine.

He also highlights Russia's hybrid warfare: from cyber attacks to sabotage, as well as unidentified drones over German military sites.

Add to that Vladimir Putin's aggressive rhetoric and General Breuer sees ""a really dangerous mixture.""

""Unlike the western world, Russia is not thinking in boxes. It's not about peacetime and war, it's a continuum: let's start with hybrid, then escalate, then back. This is what makes me think we are facing a real threat.""

He argues Germany has to act fast.

The defence chief's stark assessment of his forces' current state chimes with a recent report to parliament. The Bundeswehr, it concluded, had ""too little of everything"".

The report's author, armed forces commissioner Eva Högl, revealed dire shortages ranging from ammunition to soldiers, right down to dilapidated barracks. She estimated the budget for renovation work alone at around €67 billion ($72bn; £56bn).

Lifting the debt cap, allowing the military to borrow – in theory, without limit – will give it access to a ""steady line"" of funding to start to address that, General Breuer says.

The historic move was made by Scholz's expected successor, Friedrich Merz, in a rush that raised some eyebrows. He submitted the proposal to parliament just before it was disbanded following the February elections.

The new parliament, with an anti-militarist left and Russia-sympathising far right, might have been less favourably disposed.

But the ""turn"" that Germany started in 2022 gained fresh momentum this year.

A recent YouGov poll showed that 79% of Germans still see Vladimir Putin as ""very"" or ""quite"" dangerous to European peace and security.

Now 74% said the same for Donald Trump.

The survey followed a speech in Munich in which his Vice President JD Vance laid into Europe and its values.

""That was a clear signal that something fundamentally has changed in the United States,"" says Markus Ziener.

""We don't know where the US is heading but we know the belief that we can 100% rely on American protection when it comes to our security - that trust has now gone.""

In Berlin, Germans' traditional caution about all things military seems to be fading fast.

Eighteen-year-old Charlotte Kreft says her own pacifist views have changed.

""For a really long time, we thought the only way to make up for the atrocities we committed in World War Two was to make sure it never happened again […] and we thought we needed to demilitarise,"" Charlotte explains.

""But now we are in a situation where we have to fight for our values and democracy and freedom. We need to adapt.""

""There are lots of Germans who still feel strange about big investments in our military,"" Ludwig Stein agrees. ""But I think considering the things that have happened in the past few years, there's no other real option.""

Sophie, a young mum, thinks investing in defence is now ""necessary in the world we live in"".

But Germany needs troops as well as tanks, and she's far less keen on her own son being enlisted.

The Bundeswehr only has one permanent drop-in centre, a small unit sandwiched between a pharmacy and a shoe store beside Berlin's Friedrichstrasse station.

With camouflage-clad dummies in the window and slogans like ""cool and spicy"" it aims to attract men and women to serve, but only gets a handful of callers each day.

Germany has already missed a target of boosting its ranks by 20,000 soldiers, to 203,000, and lowering the average age from 34.

But Gen Breuer's ambitions are far greater.

He told us Germany needs an extra 100,000 troops to defend itself and Nato's eastern flank adequately - a total of 460,000, including reserves. So he insists a return to military service is ""absolutely"" necessary.

""You won't get this 100,000 without one or other model of conscription,"" the general said.

""We don't have to determine now what model brings them. For me it's only important that we get the soldiers in.""

That debate has only just begun.

General Breuer is clearly positioning himself at the front of an effort to push Germany's ""turn"" further and faster.

With his easy, engaging manner, he likes to visit regional town halls and challenge audiences there with a question: ""Are you ready for war?""

One day a woman accused him of scaring her. ""I said, 'It's not me scaring you, it's the other guy!'"" he remembers his reply.

He was referring to Vladimir Putin.

The twin ""wake-up"" alarm – of the Russia threat and an isolationist, disengaged United States – is now ringing loudly for Germany, the general argues, and can't be ignored.

""Now it's understandable to each and every one of us that we have to change.""

Musk gives away $1m cheques ahead of Wisconsin's Supreme Court election,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7v3jj5xy9o,BBC,Nadine Yousif,31-03-25,"Billionaire Elon Musk has given away $1m (£770,000) cheques to voters in Wisconsin after the state supreme court refused to intervene.

Musk announced the prize earlier this week, ahead of Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election to be held on Tuesday.

Wisconsin Attorney General and Democrat Josh Kaul had sued to stop the giveaway, arguing that Musk was violating a state law that bans gifts in exchange for votes.

The race, which could flip control of the state's supreme court to the Republicans, has become a flash point and the most expensive judicial election in American history.

Speaking at a rally Sunday night, Musk said ""we just want judges to be judges"", before handing out two $1m (£750,000) cheques to voters who had signed a petition to stop ""activist"" judges.

Kaul had tried to argue the giveaway was an illegal attempt buy votes. Musk's lawyers, in response, argued that Kaul is ""restraining Mr Musk's political speech and curtailing his First Amendment rights"".

Musk's lawyers added that the payments were ""intended to generate a grassroots movement in opposition to activist judges, not to expressly advocate for or against any candidate"".

After two lower courts sided with Musk, Kaul begged the state's supreme court for an 11th hour reprieve. But the top court unanimously declined to hear the case.

Musk and President Donald Trump have endorsed a conservative candidate, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, in hopes of flipping the liberal-leaning court.

Judge Schimel is running against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who has been endorsed by the state Supreme Court's liberal justices.

Lawyers for the tech titan also argued that judges who have publicly endorsed Judge Crawford in the Supreme Court race should be barred from ruling on the matter, arguing that it is a matter of bias.

Wisconsin's Supreme Court race is being seen by political watchers as a referendum on Trump's second term, just months after his inauguration.

It also comes ahead of consequential cases that will land before the court on abortion rights, congressional redistricting and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterm elections.

Musk himself has framed the election as a chance to stop redistricting which could give Democrats favour in Congress.

He has donated $14m to Judge Schimel's campaign, as the race proves to be the most expensive judicial race in the country's history, with $81m in total spending.

Despite his support, Judge Schimel appeared to distance himself from Musk in recent days, telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Friday he had no plans to be at the rally.

""I have no idea what he's doing. I have no idea what this rally is,"" Judge Schimel told the newspaper.

This is not the first time Musk has announced a giveaway to voters. Last year, he similarly offered a cash prize of $1m a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states if they signed a petition supporting First and Second Amendment rights.

A judge in Pennsylvania later ruled that the giveaway was legal, saying prosecutors failed to prove it was an unlawful lottery.

Red Cross outraged over killing of eight medics in Gaza,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkxm1rg6k1o,BBC,Jaroslav Lukiv,31-03-25,"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has said it is ""outraged"" at the deaths of eight medics killed on duty in Rafah in southern Gaza.

The nine-person ambulance team came under heavy fire in al-Hashashin on 23 March, said the IFRC. Their bodies were retrieved on Sunday after access was denied for a week. One medic is still missing.

The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said their staff's bodies were discovered along with those of six members of Gaza's Hamas-run civil defence agency and one UN employee.

They did not say who opened fire on the convoy - but Hamas blamed the Israel Defense Forces for the attack. The BBC has sought comment from the IDF.

In Sunday's statement, the IFRC said the eight bodies of PRCS workers were retrieved ""after seven days of silence and having access denied to the area of Rafah where they were last seen"".

The organisation identified those killed as ambulance officers Mostafa Khufaga, Saleh Muamer and Ezzedine Shaath, and first responder volunteers Mohammad Bahloul, Mohammed al-Heila, Ashraf Abu Labda, Raed al-Sharif and Rifatt Radwan.

It added that ambulance officer Assad Al-Nassasra was ""still missing"".

""I am heartbroken. These dedicated ambulance workers were responding to wounded people. They were humanitarians,"" IFRC Secretary General Jagan Chapagain said.

""They wore emblems that should have protected them; their ambulances were clearly marked.

""Even in the most complex conflict zones, there are rules. These rules of International Humanitarian Law could not be clearer – civilians must be protected; humanitarians must be protected. Health services must be protected.""

The IDF has publicly not commented on the Red Cross and Red Crescent statement.

The AFP news agency reported that on Saturday the Israeli military admitted it had fired on ambulances in southern Gaza last Sunday after identifying them as ""suspicious vehicles"".

Israeli troops had ""opened fire toward Hamas vehicles and eliminated several Hamas terrorists"", the military said in a statement to AFP.

""A few minutes afterward, additional vehicles advanced suspiciously toward the troops... The troops responded by firing toward the suspicious vehicles, eliminating a number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.""

The military added that ""after an initial inquiry, it was determined that some of the suspicious vehicles... were ambulances and fire trucks"".

It also said there had been ""repeated use"" by ""terrorist organisations in the Gaza Strip of ambulances for terrorist purposes"".

Senior Hamas official Basem Naim condemned the attack.

""The targeted killing of rescue workers - who are protected under international humanitarian law - constitutes a flagrant violation of the Geneva Conventions and a war crime,"" he said.

Israel resumed its military offensive in Gaza on 18 March after the first phase of a ceasefire that began in January came to an end, and negotiations on a second phase of the deal stalled.

More than 900 people have since been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.

The war was triggered when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 back to Gaza as captives.

Israel responded with a massive military offensive, which has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.

Shares slide in Asia as Trump tariffs loom,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjny8kee1zo,BBC,Faisal Islam,31-03-25,"Stock markets have fallen in Asia after President Donald Trump suggested that new tariffs he is set to announce this week will hit all countries, not just those that have the biggest trade imbalances with the US.

Trump made the comments as he prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday, in what he has called America's ""Liberation Day"".

The measures will come on top of tariffs already imposed by Washington on aluminium, steel and vehicles, along with increased levies on all goods from China.

""You'd start with all countries,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.

But he said his administration would be ""far more generous"" and ""kinder"" than the countries had been to the US.

With 48 hours to go before the tariffs come into force, the UK is still locked in talks with the US about an exemption.

On Sunday, Downing Street said thatPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had had ""productive negotiations"" with Trumpin a phone call, adding that talks would ""continue at pace"".

On Saturday, government sources had said thatthe UK would not hesitate to impose its own tariffson the US if needed.

Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures.

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, recently told the Fox Business channel the tariffs would focus on 10 to 15 countries that have the worst trade deficits with the US, but did not name them.

Trump sees trade taxes - which in this case would be paid by the US companies importing goods -  as a way of protecting the American economy from unfair competition and as a bargaining chip for getting better trading terms.

Concerns about a trade war are unsettling markets and creating fears of a recession in the US.



On Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark share index closed more than 4% lower, the Kospi in South Korea ended the day down 3% and the ASX 200 in Australia fell 1.7%.

In the UK, the FTSE 100 index opened about 0.9% lower, while Germany's Dax index and France's Cac 40 were both down 1%.

Over the weekend Trump's advisers echoed his view that the planned tariffs could raise trillions of dollars and help create jobs in the US.

His top trade adviser, Pete Navarro, pointed to huge revenues he said the tariffs would raise.

The tax on all car imports could raise $100bn (£77.3bn) a year, Mr Navarro said. All the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US, he added.

A White House fact sheet published last week suggested a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs.

However, there are concerns that tariffs could fuel inflation - something Trump pledged to reduce during his presidential campaign - if companies choose to pass on the higher cost of importing goods to their customers.

If companies absorb the cost, if could hit profit which in turn could affect investment.

Will Butler-Adams, chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes, said US tariffs were creating uncertainty.

While, at the moment, Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes, he said the people interpreting the tariffs are trying to establish how much steel in products might have come from outside the US, which might therefore lead to tariffs.

""The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,"" Mr Butler-Adams said.

About 10% of Brompton's sales come from the US, where it has grown from a staff of four to 40 people and has shops in New York and Washington.

But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs might prove to be ""counter-productive"".

""Ironically, if he puts taxes on, it is going to make our product less competitive,"" he said.

""We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now. We may even shrink, in the extreme we might pull out.""

Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday.

He set the 5 April deadline in January for the short video platform to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the US on national security grounds.

It had been due to take effect that month to comply with a law passed under the Biden administration.

Secret filming reveals brazen tactics of UK immigration scammers,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1en4dx7yn9o,BBC,Tamasin Ford,30-03-25,"Recruitment agents who scam foreign nationals applying to work in the UK care sector have been exposed by BBC secret filming.

One of the rogue agents is a Nigerian doctor who has worked for the NHS in the field of psychiatry.

The Home Office has acknowledged the system is open to abuse, but the BBC World Service's investigation shows the apparent ease with which these agents can scam people, avoid detection, and continue to profit.

Our secret filming reveals agents' tactics, including:

Reports of immigration scams have increased since a government visa scheme - originally designed to let foreign medical professionals work in the UK - was broadened in 2022 to include care workers.

To apply for the visa, candidates must first obtain a ""Certificate of Sponsorship"" (CoS) from a UK employer who is licensed by the Home Office. It is the need for CoS documents that is being exploited by rogue relocation agents.

""The scale of exploitation under the Health and Care Work visa is significant,"" says Dora-Olivia Vicol, CEO of Work Rights Centre, a charity that helps migrants and disadvantaged people in the UK access employment justice.

""I think it has turned into a national crisis.""

She says there is ""systemic risk inherent"" in the sponsorship system, because it ""puts the employer in a position of incredible power"" and has ""enabled this predatory market of middlemen to mushroom"".

The BBC sent two undercover journalists to approach relocation agents working in the UK.

One met Dr Kelvin Alaneme, a Nigerian doctor and founder of the agency, CareerEdu, based in Harlow, Essex.

His website states his business is a ""launchpad for global opportunities catering to young Africans"", claiming to have 9,800 ""happy clients"".

Believing the BBC undercover journalist was well connected in the UK care sector, Dr Alaneme tried to recruit her to become an agent for his business, saying it would be very lucrative.

""Just get me care homes. I can make you a millionaire,"" he said.

As a potential business partner, our journalist was then given unprecedented insight into how immigration scams by agents like Dr Alaneme actually work. Dr Alaneme said he would pay £2,000 ($2,600) for each care home vacancy she was able to procure, and offered £500 ($650) commission on top.

He then said he would sell the vacancies to candidates back in Nigeria.

Charging candidates for a job is illegal in the UK.

""They [the candidates] are not supposed to be paying because it's free. It should be free,"" he said, lowering his voice.

""They are paying because they know it's most likely the only way.""

The BBC began investigating him following a series of online complaints about his relocation services.

Praise - from south-east Nigeria and in his mid 30s - was one of those who complained, claiming he paid Dr Alaneme more than £10,000 ($13,000) for a job in the UK. He says he was told he was going to be working with a care company called Efficiency for Care, based in Clacton-on-Sea. It was only when he arrived that he realised the job didn't exist.

""If I had known there was no job, I would have not come here,"" he says. ""At least back home in Nigeria, if you go broke, I can find my sister or my parents and go and eat free food. It's not the same here. You will go hungry.""

Praise says he messaged Efficiency for Care and Dr Alaneme for months, asking when he could start working. Despite promises of assistance from Dr Alaneme, the job never materialised. Almost a year later, he found a position with another care provider willing to sponsor him to remain in the UK.

Our investigation found that Efficiency for Care employed - on average - 16 people in 2022, and 152 in 2023. Yet a letter sent from the Home Office to the company dated May 2023 - and seen by the BBC - showed it had issued 1,234 Certificates of Sponsorship to foreign workers between March 2022 and May 2023.

Efficiency for Care's sponsorship licence was revoked in July 2023. The care company can no longer recruit from abroad, but continues to operate.

It told the BBC it strongly refutes the allegation it colluded with Dr Alaneme. It said it believed it lawfully recruited staff from Nigeria and other countries. It has challenged the Home Office's revocation of its sponsorship licence, it said, and the matter is now in court.

In another secretly filmed meeting, Dr Alaneme shared an even more sophisticated scam involving sponsorship documents for jobs that did not exist.

He said the ""advantage"" of having a CoS that is unconnected to a job ""is that you can choose any city you want"".

""You can go to Glasgow. You can stay in London. You can live anywhere,"" he told us.

This is not true. If a migrant arrives in the UK on a Health and Care Work visa and does not work in the role they have been assigned, their visa could be cancelled and they risk being deported.

In the secret filming, Dr Alaneme also described how to set up a fake payroll system to mask the fact the jobs are not real.

""That [a money trail] is what the government needs to see,"" he said.

Dr Alaneme told the BBC he strenuously denied services offered by CareerEdu were a scam or that it acted as a recruitment agency or provided jobs for cash. He said his company only offered legitimate services, adding that the money Praise gave him was passed on to a recruitment agent for Praise's transport, accommodation and training. He said he offered to help Praise find another employer free of charge.

The BBC also carried out undercover filming with another UK-based recruitment agent, Nana Akwasi Agyemang-Prempeh, after several people told the BBC they had collectively paid tens of thousands of pounds for care worker positions for their friends and family that, it transpired, did not exist.

They said some of the Certificates of Sponsorship Mr Agyemang-Prempeh gave them had turned out to be fakes - replicas of real CoS issued by care companies.

We discovered Mr Agyemang-Prempeh had then begun offering CoS for UK jobs in construction - another industry that allows employers to recruit foreign workers. He was able to set up his own construction company and obtain a sponsorship licence from the Home Office.

Our journalist, posing as a UK-based Ugandan businessman wanting to bring Ugandan construction workers over to join him, asked Mr Agyemang-Prempeh if this was possible.

He replied it was - for the price of £42,000 ($54,000) for three people.

Mr Agyemang-Prempeh told us he had moved into construction because rules are being ""tightened"" in the care sector - and claimed agents were eyeing other industries.

""People are now diverting to IT,"" Mr Agyemang-Prempeh told the undercover journalist.

More than 470 licences in the UK care sector were revoked by the government between July 2022 and December 2024. Those licensed sponsors were responsible for the recruitment of more than 39,000 medical professionals and care workers from October 2020.

Mr Agyemang-Prempeh later asked for a downpayment for the Certificates of Sponsorship, which the BBC did not make.

The Home Office has now revoked his sponsorship licence. Mr Agyemang-Prempeh's defence, when challenged by the BBC, was that he had himself been duped by other agents and did not realise he was selling fake CoS documents.

In a statement to the BBC, the Home Office said it has ""robust new action against shameless employers who abuse the visa system"" and will ""ban businesses who flout UK employment laws from sponsoring overseas workers"".

BBC investigations have previously uncovered similar visa scamstargeting people in Kerala, India, andinternational students living in the UKwho want to work in the care sector.

In November 2024, the governmentannounced a clampdown on ""rogue"" employers hiring workers from overseas. Additionally, from 9 April, care providers in England will berequired to prioritise recruiting international care workers already in the UKbefore recruiting from overseas.

Many French commentators – and not only those who support Le Pen – have warned of grave consequences for democracy if the judiciary is seen as interfering in the choice of the country's leader.

""The justice system has the fate of Marine Le Pen in its hands… For her to be convicted for any wrong-doing is perfectly normal. But stopping her from running in the presidential [election] - that's another matter entirely,"" wrote veteran analyst Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the centre-right Le Point magazine.

""Is it not hazardous - not to say perilous - to give to judges the task of determining whether this or that candidate has the capacity to run for office?"" said Bruno Jeudi, editor of La Tribune Dimanche newspaper on Sunday.

Marine Le Pen told the same newspaper: ""Personally I'm not nervous.  But I can see why people think I might be. The judges have the power of life or death over the movement.  But I don't think they will go so far as to do it.""

Various scenarios for the verdict are under scrutiny.

First, Le Pen could be cleared of blame in the EU parliamentary money affair. This is widely seen as unlikely.

Second, the judges could convict her but make the ineligibility not automatic. In that case, she would immediately appeal and the ineligibility would not apply until after a second trial (and conceivably a third to the high court of appeal).

That would leave her free to run in 2027, though with the handicap of a conviction for misuse of public money. However it is far from clear that a conviction would do her cause much damage, given the series of party funding scandals that have affected all French parties over the years.

Third, the judges could follow the prosecutor and order automatic ineligibility. In this case she would appeal, and the other parts of the sentence (fine and prison) would be suspended. However she would be unable to run in 2027.

Fourth, the court could give her a shorter term of automatic ineligibility - say one year - making it theoretically possible for her to run.

2027 would be Marine Le Pen's fourth presidential race, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory.

A poll in the right-wing newspaper JDD Sunday gave her between 34-37% of the first round vote, well ahead of any of her possible rivals.

In the last two presidentials, she fell foul of the two-round system which allowed opponents of left, centre and right torally behind a single candidate – Emmanuel Macron – to keep her from power.

But years of ""detoxification"" after she eclipsed her father Jean-Marie Le Pen at the head of the party have made the anti-RN vote far less cohesive than it used to be, while victories for the far-right in other countries have helped lift the taboo of an RN government.

If Le Pen is barred from running, her logical replacement would be Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old party president who was being groomed to be her eventual prime minister.

However party insiders admit there has been little internal preparation for what would be widely seen as a huge and destabilising political earthquake.

One result of Le Pen being declared unable to run in 2027 could be to weaken still further the minority French government of Prime Minister François Bayrou. With 120 members in the National Assembly, the RN has the power to vote with the left in avote of no-confidence to bring the government down.

Until now, Marine Le Pen has held back her troops. She might feel less inclined to,  if she feels she has been the victim of an establishment stitch-up.

Rocket crashes back to Earth just moments after launch in Norway,https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c39jkp4m7xzo,BBC,,30-03-25,"A test rocket aimed at kickstarting European satellite launches has crashed back to Earth moments after taking flight.

The unmanned Spectrum rocket, which took off from a Norwegian spaceport on Sunday, was billed as the first attempt at an orbital flight to come from Europe.

German start-up Isar Aerospace developed the rocket and had warned ahead of the test that the initial launch could end prematurely. The company said 30 seconds of flight was enough time to register data.

"Wounded Palestinians dying over lack of supplies, US surgeon who worked in Gaza says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxr7np4xzo,BBC,Sebastian Usher,30-03-25,"Warning: This article contains details that some readers may find distressing

An American surgeon who's been working in two Gaza hospitals for the past three weeks has said that wounded Palestinian patients have died because of the lack of equipment and supplies.

Dr Mark Perlmutter says that doctors have had to work in operating rooms without soap, antibiotics or x-ray facilities, as Israel has resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza.

A 15-year-old girl who was hit by Israeli machine gun fire while riding her bicycle was one of the many wounded children that Dr Perlmutter said he had to operate on.

The Israeli government has said the renewed attacks that its military is carrying out in Gaza are aimed at forcing Hamas to release all the remaining hostages.

Dr Perlmutter spoke to the BBC shortly after the end of his second trip to Gaza - the first one was around a year ago. Critical of Israel's conduct in the Strip, he has previously called for an arms embargo and said its attacks on Gaza constitute genocide, which Israel vehemently denies.

This time, he worked in Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory and then in Nasser hospital in the south of Gaza.

He has been working for Humanity Auxilium in Gaza as part of a wider World Health Organization (WHO) programme.

He was in Nasser hospital when it was hit by an Israeli air strike, targeting Ismail Barhoum, the Hamas finance chief.

Hamas said that Barhoum was being treated for injuries that he suffered in an earlier Israeli attack. The Israeli military denied this, saying he was in the hospital ""in order to commit acts of terrorism"".

Dr Perlmutter has told the BBC that Barhoum was in the hospital to receive further medical treatment. He says that as a patient in hospital, Barhoum had a right to be protected under the Geneva Convention.

The human cost of the latest Israeli offensive was exemplified for Dr Perlmutter by two 15-year-olds - including the girl on the bicycle - who were brought into the operating room in each of the hospitals he was working in, a week apart.

""They were both macerated and shredded by Apache gunships,"" Dr Perlmutter says.

The girl will, in his words, ""be lucky if she keeps three of her limbs"".

Dr Perlmutter says that people at the scene told the ambulance crew who brought the young girl into the hospital that she was hit by gunfire from an Israeli military helicopter.

He says that she had been riding her bicycle by herself and she arrived at the hospital without a backpack or anything else that might have aroused suspicion. Graphic images from the operating table show catastrophic wounds to her leg and arm.

The boy was driving in a car with his grandmother after receiving warnings to evacuate from the north, Dr Perlmutter says.

""Then the car was attacked by two Apache gunships. The grandmother was shredded at the scene and died,"" he said.

""The boy came in without a foot on his right side, the vascular repair on his left side took five hours - the nerve repair on his left side failed and he had a blackened hand the next day that required amputation at the level of his elbow - his left leg will require multiple surgeries for reconstruction and he has a chest wound. He may not have survived.""

Dr Perlmutter has also provided graphic photos of the boy's wounds.

In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it ""does not target uninvolved individuals.""

""The IDF operates in accordance with international law, targeting only military objectives while taking feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians,"" it told the BBC.

The statement also said that the IDF had not been provided with ""sufficient information"" to directly address the incidents that Dr Perlmutter described.

""The IDF takes action to address irregular incidents that deviate from its orders. The IDF examines such incidents and takes appropriate measures where justified,"" it said.

Under such conditions, Dr Perlmutter stressed the commitment and dedication of the Palestinian medical staff - above and beyond the efforts of foreign doctors like himself.

""The stress levels on us are not even approachable to what happens even to the Palestinian medical students that work with us, whose stress levels are insane, as with the nurses and the techs in the operating room, let alone the Palestinian surgeons,"" he said.

""They all abandon their families, they volunteer and often work without pay.  They work the same hours that we do - and we get to go home in a month, which they don't. They still have to return to the squalor of their tents where there's often 50 people living in a tent built for 20 - and sharing one toilet.""

Most hospitals across Gaza are out of operation or barely managing to function. Dr Perlmutter compared the medical facilities in Gaza to where he lives in North Carolina. There are multiple trauma centres there, but they would have been overwhelmed, he says, if they had to deal with the mass influx of casualties that resulted from the first day of Israel's resumption of its war against Hamas.

""The small community hospital, Al-Aqsa, is a tenth the size of any of the facilities in my home state - maybe smaller - and it did well to manage those horrible injuries - nevertheless, because of lack of equipment, many, many of those patients died, who would certainly not have died at a better equipped hospital,"" he said.

On Saturday the UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher described the current situation in Gaza as dire.

""All entry points into Gaza are closed for cargo since early March. At the border, food is rotting, medicine expiring and vital medical equipment is stuck,"" he said.

""If the basic principles of humanitarian law still count, the international community must act to uphold them.""

On 2 March the Israeli government closed border crossings with Gaza and halted humanitarian aid. It said this was in response to what it called the refusal by Hamas of a new US proposal toextend the first stage of the ceasefireand hostage release deal, rather than negotiating a second phase.

""When Israel resumed its attacks, it was almost identical to when they bombed incessantly when I was here a year ago,"" Dr Perlmutter says. ""The only difference is now instead of bombing people in buildings, they were bombing people in tents.""

The Israeli army has regularly claimed that Hamas operates from areas where civilians are taking shelter. It says that it does not target civilians and takes measures to avoid civilian casualties.

TheInternational Criminal Court (ICC) last year issued arrest warrantsfor Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes, saying it found reasonable grounds to believe that ""each bear criminal responsibility... for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population"".

They deny this, and Netanyahu condemned the warrants as ""antisemitic"".

Israeli attacks have killed more than 15,000 Palestinian children in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported.

And since the IDF broke a ceasefire and resumed its strikes on 18 March, 921 Palestinians have been killed, the ministry said.

Dr Perlmutter warns that if there are more mass casualty events in Gaza from Israeli attacks, the lack of supplies in the two hospitals he's been working in means that more Palestinians will die from wounds that could have been treated.

"Richard Chamberlain, Shogun star, dies aged 90",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v9xzw09z0o,BBC,Rachel Hagan,30-03-25,"Richard Chamberlain, the actor best known for his role in the 1960s medical drama Dr Kildare and leading role in Shogun, has died aged 90, his publicist has confirmed to the BBC.

Chamberlain earned the title ""king of the mini-series"" for his leading roles in Shogun and The Thorn Birds.

He died late on Saturday night local time (10:15 GMT Sunday) in Waimanalo, Hawaii, after suffering complications from a stroke, his publicist Harlan Boll confirmed - just hours before he would have turned 91.

Martin Rabbett, Chamberlain's longtime partner, called him an ""amazing and loving soul"" in a statement.

He said: ""Our beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us.""

Rabbett added: ""Love never dies. And our love is under his wings, lifting him to his next great adventure.""

Chamberlain's big break came in 1961, when he became a household name as Dr James Kildare in Dr Kildare.

The show, based on a popular 1930s and 40s film series, attracted millions of viewers, turning Chamberlain into a beloved leading man and a teen idol.

The popularity Dr Kildare earnt Chamberlain meant that, for three consecutive years between 1963 and 1965, he was named the most popular male star by Photoplay magazine.

He went on to becomethe king of the 1980s TV mini-series, playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.

The latter won 60% of the US television audience and earned 16 Emmy nominations.

Though widely recognised as a romantic leading man, Chamberlain's private life remained largely a mystery until later in his life.

He did not publicly address his sexuality until the release of his memoir, Shattered Love, in 2003, where he revealed that he was gay.

Throughout his 30-year relationship with actor-director Rabbett, they had kept their private life secret.

In his memoir, he recalled escorting glamorous actresses to premieres, explaining that he had been ""desperately afraid"" his sexuality would derail his career.

""I used to get chased by hot teenage girls,"" he once told TV Guide. ""I got 12,000 fan letters a week. And I felt somewhat besieged.""

Rabbett and Chamberlain separated in 2010 but remained close.

Born on 31 March 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, Chamberlain grew up on what he called ""the wrong side of Wilshire Boulevard"" - far from the wealth of Hollywood's star-studded district.

The younger of two boys, his father, Charles, was a salesman who struggled with alcoholism and became a prominent figure in Alcoholics Anonymous, travelling the world to speak at conventions.His mother, Elsa, was a homemaker.

He initially studied painting at Pomona College, but a student theatre performance inspired him to pursue acting.

Interest from a Hollywood scout was put on hold as he was drafted into the US Army, where he rose to the rank of sergeant while stationed in South Korea.

Upon returning to California, Chamberlain took acting classes, landing several small TV roles before his breakout role as Dr Kildare.

Years later, Chamberlain recounted the psychological abuse he endured during his childhood.

He described how his father's ""lethal sneer"" and emotionally abusive behaviour made him feel as if he were being ""slashed with a machete"".

Chamberlain also spoke about the relief he experienced in finally not having to hide his sexuality later in life.

Australia's Min Woo Lee claimed his first PGA Tour win with victory at the Houston Open in a dramatic finish.

Lee was leading by three shots on 21 under from Scottie Scheffler and Gary Woodland when he put his tee shot into the water at the par-five 16th and carded a bogey.

Woodland finished with an eagle and two birdies from his final four holes to equal the course record of 62 and set the clubhouse lead at 19 under.

World number one Scheffler, playing in the penultimate group, had a chance to take a share of the lead on the 17th but missed a putt for a fifth consecutive birdie - and also ended on 19 under after a final-round 63.

Lee needed a par on the 18th to secure victory and managed it, holding his nerve to card a 67 and finish one shot clear on 20 under.

""It's hard, really hard,"" said Lee, 26, after his triumph. ""Scottie is a wonderful golfer and he keeps you on your toes.

""This is my first time being in front and trying to hold a lead. I'm glad I got it done, but man, I'm just very exhausted.

""It was a lot of mental grind. I'm so proud of the way I handled myself.""

Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy produced an impressive six-under-par round of 64, which included an eagle, six birdies and a bogey, as he got to 15 under.

""It was a good week,"" said McIlroy, who is hoping to complete a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters at Augusta next month.

""I still feel like I've got some stuff to work on. Overall, a solid week and nice to have another week to get ready and fine tune my game for Augusta.

""My right elbow has been bothering me a little bit so [I'll] maybe just get some treatment on that to make sure it's OK going into Augusta.""

UK to host 40 countries for illegal migration summit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg5wkk1g1go,BBC,Mark Easton,31-03-25,"Representatives from the US, China and France are among 40 nations joining a two-day summit in London aimed at tackling illegal migration.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is expected to say the ""vile trade"" of people-smuggling profits from political divisions between affected countries, and he will warn against pitting ""nations against one another"".

The international talks are seen as the first of their kind, with the UK government hopeful they will produce ""concrete outcomes"".

Immigration is seen as a key issue for the government politically, with both the Conservatives and Reform UK accusing Labour of failing to get a grip on the issue.

Ahead of the summit, the Home Office announced that £33m would be spent to disrupt people-smuggling networks and boost prosecutions.

Border Security Minister Angela Eagle told BBC Breakfast that measures being put in place by the government would help ""make a difference"" to cut small boat crossings in the Channel, but that it would take time to get policies ""operationalised"".

Officials from Vietnam, Albania and Iraq - countries from which many migrants have travelled to the UK - will attend the summit at London's Lancaster House, alongside French, Chinese and US representatives.

Delegations from the Kurdish Regional Government, Interpol and social media companies including Meta, X and TikTok, are also involved in discussions on how to disrupt a criminal trade worth an estimated $10bn (£7.7bn) a year.

More than 6,000 people have crossed the Channel so far in 2025, making it a record start to a year for small boat arrivals.

The UK has previously announced a series of agreements with other countries in an effort to tackle the number of such arrivals.

Sir Keir wants the UK to be seen as leading the global response to irregular migration and the summit underlines the government's conviction that only international co-operation along the smuggling routes can tackle the issue.

The PM is set to suggest the event will strengthen UK borders and take the burden away from British public services, while ""giving hotels back to the local economy"".

In comments expected to be delivered at the summit, the prime minister will refer to working across borders when he was director of public prosecutions to ""foil numerous plots"", including preventing planes from being ""blown up over the Atlantic"".

""I believe we should treat organised immigration crime in the same way,"" he will add.

He is also expected to say: ""This vile trade exploits the cracks between our institutions, pits nations against one another and profits from our inability at the political level to come together.""

The summit will deliver ""concrete outcomes"" for nations in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and North America, according to the Home Office.

Among developments aimed at tackling illegal migration ahead of the gathering:

On Sunday, Tory shadow minister Alex Burghart told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that Labour should never have scrapped the Rwanda deportation plan.

Earlier,Cooper told the show that plans for new checks on unauthorised working would help cut levels of illegal migration.

The Swedish city fined for missing an environmental target,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx1rl8dk2o,BBC,MaryLou Costa,31-03-25,"Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.

Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a ""sustainability linked loan"" or SLL.

This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.

Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.

Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; £8,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.

In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.

However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.

Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set ""ambitious"" targets.

""You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.

""We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.""

The improvements to the city's poorest areas – and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.

Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.

Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.

""For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,"" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.

""We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.

""I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.""

But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.

""What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?"" she says.

""What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.""

Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.

""People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,"" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.

Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.

Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023,according to datafrom financial news provider Bloomberg.

Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.

He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.

""It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,"" he says. ""You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.

""It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.""

One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed £10m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.

Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.

By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.

""If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.

""It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.""

Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.

""Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,"" he says.

""I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.""

Richard Chamberlain: Heartthrob king of the TV mini-series,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe2nv0mdv2o,BBC,Rachel Hagan,30-03-25,"Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.

His dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.

But, in middle age, his career spiked again.

Chamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.

He denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.

In interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.

""There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,"" he said. ""Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.""

George Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.

His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a ""shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face"".

He admitted to being the most ""uncooperative kid in school"" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics.

At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.

Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.

On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.

Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.

He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his ""fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance"".

But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.

""Perhaps it was inevitable,"" said one friend-and-rival. ""Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?""

The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.

It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.

There was a huge reaction from female fans.

Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.

The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.

Fans would even write in asking ""Dr Kildare"" to solve their various medical problems.

And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.

He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.

Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.

In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.

Audiences, they said, laughed in ""all the wrong places"". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.

He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.

The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'

In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.

And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.

This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.

But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.

The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.

Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.

He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.

In 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.

It sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.

He beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.

The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.

Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.

It was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.

In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.

There were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.

These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.

In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.

Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.

""I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,"" he said, ""and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.""

Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.

In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.

He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.

But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.

""I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,"" he told El Pais in 2024. ""But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.""

He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.

Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.

The Canadian Conservative trying to sweet talk Trump,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jgx10z8qqo,BBC,"Nadine Yousif, Jessica Murphy",30-03-25,"Alberta Premier Danielle Smith says she is willing to walk into the ""lion's den"" to sway US officials against Canadian tariffs - wooing the US president with meetings at Mar-a-Lago and cosying up with Trump-friendly media.

While many of Canada's leaders - from Prime Minister Mark Carney to Ontario's Premier Doug Ford - are talking tough on Donald Trump, Smith has been taking a notably softer approach.

But this tack has led to controversy - not only with her opponents, but also in her home province of Alberta, and with politicians who otherwise share her political leanings.

It has also put federal Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre on the defensive in the early days of the country's short federal electoral race. Canadians are scheduled to vote on 28 April.

In January, while Trump was still president-elect, Smith had what she called a ""friendly and constructive conversation"" with him at Mar-a-Lago about the two countries' shared energy relationship.

But an early March interview with right-wing US news outlet Breitbart made her friendliness with US Republican circles a liability for Poilievre and the federal Conservatives.

Smith, a former talk radio host and newspaper columnist, was asked by Breitbart News Washington bureau chief Matthew Boyle about the Poilievre-Trump relationship. In response, Smith said that the ""unjust and unfair"" tariffs threatened by Trump ""actually caused an increase in the support for the Liberals"".

""And so that's what I fear, is that the longer this dispute goes on, politicians posture, and it seems to be benefiting the Liberals right now,"" she said.

""So I would hope that we could put things on pause is what I've told administration officials. Let's just put things on pause so we can get through an election.""

Smith also told Breitbart that Poilievre brought a perspective that ""would be very much in sync, I think, with the new direction in America"", adding that a Conservative government in Canada would help smooth relations with the US.

The interview resurfaced this week as federal leaders were busy campaigning ahead of April's election, and Smith was quickly criticised by Poilievre's political opponents. New Democratic Party (NDP) leader Jagmeet Singh called the interview ""shameful"" and questioned Smith's loyalty to Canada.

The Liberals, meanwhile, have used it as political ammunition to bolster their attack line that Trump and Poilievre are too similar for Canadians who want to stand up to the US.

Her comments were construed by some as asking Trump to delay tariffs so that a Conservative could win.

Some on social media even called Smith a ""traitor"" and accused her of pushing Trump to interfere with Canada's elections - a point that she has strongly rebuffed.

""Interference is one thing,"" Smith told the Alberta legislature on Monday. ""Asking the US to refrain from [tariffs] is actually the opposite. I do not want to see anyone interfere in our elections.""

Poilievre, for his part, has attempted to dodge these attacks on the campaign trail. Asked about Smith's remarks, he said: ""People are free to make their own comments. I speak for myself.""

Later in the week, Smith found herself in more hot water after she refused calls to cancel a trip to Florida on Thursday, where she appeared at a PragerU fundraising event alongside Ben Shapiro, a right-wing pundit.

The two reportedly discussed how to help Canada elect ""solid allies"" to the Trump administration, according to Canada's left-leaning media outlet the National Observer, which obtained audio of the event.

Smith's chief of staff Rob Anderson has defended the trip, saying the premier is ""going into the lion's den to try and convince US decision makers to cancel or even delay tariffs for as long as possible,"" adding that her approach is ""as Albertan and Canadian as it gets"".

For political watchers in Alberta, Smith's appearance on Breitbart and at PragerU is an extension of her friendlier approach to diplomacy with the US.

Smith has often argued that trade with the US is ""mutually beneficial"" for both economies.

She noted that her province sends most of its oil and gas to the US, and has criticised the federal Liberal government for environmental policies that she argues have blocked Alberta's oil to other markets.

She has also refused to use oil as a bargaining chip to fight back against US tariffs - breaking from the position held by most other provincial leaders. Ford, by contrast, was willing to slap an export tariff on Ontario's energy in retaliation.

Jared Wesley, a professor of political science at the University of Alberta and expert on politics in Western Canada, said that many Albertans were open to Smith's unconventional approach if it meant securing gains for the province and for Canada.

But her recent comments on Breitbart have raised questions on whether ""there were partisan considerations that were being thrown into the mix"", he said.

""A lot of Albertans are just trying to make sense of the purpose of these visits (to the US), because they are quite frequent,"" Prof Wesley told the BBC.

This has created a political dilemma for Poilievre, he noted, who is now lagging in national polls behind Carney and the Liberals - a dramatic reversal after his party had been ahead since mid-2023.

""He's been trying to distance himself from the Republican Trump wing of the global conservative movement,"" Prof Wesley said. ""And here is Danielle Smith saying that he's part and parcel of it.""

Not everyone, however, opposes the premier's approach. Barry Cooper, a longtime conservative political scientist in Alberta, noted that Smith's approval rating - while one of the lowest among Canada's premiers - has not budged at around 46%.

He added that Smith acknowledged Alberta's interests differ from the rest of the country, and that she was focused on ensuring economic prosperity for the province by maintaining good ties with the US and being present at any negotiation tables.

""Whatever they say [in eastern Canada] makes absolutely no difference to the support that the premier is going to get, because she is standing up for this province,"" Dr Cooper told the BBC. ""And quite frankly, I don't think she really cares too much.""

It is unclear whether Trump has been swayed at all by Smith's lobbying, though the premier took credit on Friday for shifting Shapiro's opinion on tariffs, after he spoke out against them.

The US president did reduce his threatened tariffs on Canadian energy products from 25% to 10%, but Canadian politicians - including Smith - have said that the better outcome is no tariffs at all.

Trump's tone towards Canada has turned positive in recent days following his first phone call with Liberal leader and Prime Minister Carney. But it remains to be seen whether this will translate into any reprieve.

Myanmar earthquake: What we know,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlxlxd7882o,BBC,"Jack Burgess, Rachel Hagan",30-03-25,"Myanmar is reeling following the huge earthquake which hit the country on Friday, 28 March.

The magnitude-7.7 tremor was felt elsewhere, including in Thailand and south-west China.

More than 1,700 people have died and more than 3,400 have been injured, say the leaders of the country's military government. In Thailand, at least 18 lost their lives.

Here is what we know so far.

The earthquake's epicentre was located 16km (10 miles) north-west of Myanmar's city Sagaing, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said.

This is also near Myanmar's second-largest city, Mandalay, with a population of about 1.5 million people - and about 100km (60 miles) north of the capital, Nay Pyi Taw.

The first earthquake struck at about 12:50 (06:20 GMT), according to the USGS. A second earthquake struck 12 minutes later, with a magnitude of 6.4. Its epicentre was 18km (11 miles) south of Sagaing.

Aftershocks have continued since - the latest on Sunday was a magnitude-5.1 tremor north-west of Mandalay, with a resident telling BBC Burmese it was the strongest they had felt since 28 March.

The strong quake buckled roads, damaged bridges and flattened many buildings in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma) - a country of some 55 million people.

It is considered one of the world's most geologically ""active"" areas.

The ruling junta said 1,591 houses had been damaged in the Mandalay region. Scores of people remain trapped with rescuers searching ""with bare hands"".

Strong tremors were also felt elsewhere, including in Thailand and south-west China.

The Thai capital, Bangkok, sits more than 1,000km (621 miles) from the epicentre of Friday's earthquake - and yet an unfinished high-rise building in the city was felled by it.

Videos also showed rooftop pools in Bangkok spilling over the sides of swaying buildings.

The official death toll now stands at 1,700. Many of the fatalities were in Mandalay.

More than 3,400 people were injured and 300 are missing.

The US Geological Survey's modelling estimates Myanmar's death toll could exceed 10,000, with losses surpassing annual economic output.

Rescue operations are ongoing, with one rescue team in Mandalay saying they were ""digging people out with our bare hands"".

Meanwhile, in Bangkok, 18 people have been confirmed dead - 11 of them at the high-rise building (10 died at the scene, one died at the hospital), where 78 remain missing.

Getting information out of Myanmar is difficult.

Myanmar has been ruled bya military juntasince a coup in 2021, complicating access to information.

The state controls almost all local radio, television, print and online media. Internet use is also restricted.

Mobile lines in the affected areas have been patchy, but tens of thousands of people also live without electricity, making it difficult for the BBC to reach residents.

Foreign journalists are rarelyallowed into the country officially.

Some international aid - mainly from China and India - has begun to arrive after the military authorities issued a rare appeal.

Aid has also been sent from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Russia.

Rescuers from several countries have joined the local efforts to locate and pull put any survivors.

The Red Cross has issued an urgent appeal for $100m (£77m).

The NUG has announced that its armed wing, the People's Defence Force (PDF), will pause ""offensive military operations"" for two weeks in earthquake-affected areas, except for ""defensive actions.""

Anti-coup PDF battalions have been fighting the military junta since the latter seized power in 2021.

The pause is set to begin on Sunday, but its impact is uncertain as many ethnic armed groups act independently of the NUG.

Meanwhile, the junta has continued airstrikes in some areas, with the UN condemning them as ""completely outrageous and unacceptable.""

The Earth's crust is made up of separate bits, called plates, that nestle alongside each other.

These plates often try to move but are prevented by the friction of rubbing up against an adjoining one.

But sometimes, the pressure builds until one plate suddenly jerks across, causing the surface to move.

They are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the Richter scale, which is now considered outdated and less accurate.

The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it.

A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage. The Myanmar earthquake at 7.7 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance.

Anything above 8.0 causes catastrophic damage and can totally destroy communities at its centre.

The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has warned about the possibility of several strong aftershocks in places affected by the earthquake.

It has advised people in the area, or tourists planning to travel toMyanmar,ThailandorLaos, to monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and tour operators.

The FCDO has also previously issued advice against travel to parts of Myanmar and all but essential travel to parts of Thailand and Laos.

Myanmar's security situation ""may deteriorate at short notice and the military regime can introduce travel restrictions at any time"" amid an ""increasingly volatile"" conflict, it said.

The FCDO's warning for parts of Thailand is ""due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia"" and its advice for Laos relates to ""intermittent attacks on infrastructure and armed clashes with anti-government groups"" in Xaisomboun province.

This earthquake and its aftershocks were relatively shallow - about 10km in depth.

That means the impact on the surface is likely to have been more devastating than a deeper earthquake, with buildings shaken much harder and more likely to collapse.

On 26 December 2004,one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that swept away entire communities around the Indian Ocean. That 9.1 magnitude quake killed about 228,000 people.

The largest ever earthquake registered 9.5 and was recorded in Chile in 1960.

The Swedish city fined for missing an environmental target,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx1rl8dk2o,BBC,MaryLou Costa,31-03-25,"Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.

Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a ""sustainability linked loan"" or SLL.

This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.

Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.

Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; £8,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.

In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.

However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.

Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set ""ambitious"" targets.

""You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.

""We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.""

The improvements to the city's poorest areas – and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.

Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.

Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.

""For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,"" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.

""We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.

""I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.""

But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.

""What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?"" she says.

""What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.""

Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.

""People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,"" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.

Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.

Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023,according to datafrom financial news provider Bloomberg.

Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.

He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.

""It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,"" he says. ""You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.

""It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.""

One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed £10m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.

Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.

By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.

""If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.

""It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.""

Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.

""Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,"" he says.

""I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.""

Trump wants India to buy US corn - but here's why it probably won't,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204q6n0lzvo,BBC,Soutik Biswas,30-03-25,"Why won't India buy even a single bushel of American corn?

That's the question US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised recently whilecriticisingIndia's trade policies, taking a swipe at its market restrictions.

In another interview, Lutnickaccused India of blocking US farmersand urged it to open its agricultural market - suggesting quotas or limits as a possible approach.

Agriculture is a key battleground in US President Donald Trump'sescalating trade war, with tit-for-tat or reciprocal tariffs set to kick in on 2 April.

Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.Trump has repeatedly branded India a ""tariff king"" and a ""big abuser"" of trade ties.

For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.

To be sure, India's transformation from a food-deficient nation to a food-surplus powerhouse is one of its biggest success stories.

In the 1950s and '60s, the country relied on food aid to feed its population, but a series of agricultural breakthroughs changed that. India became self-sufficient in staples, and became the world's largest milk producer. Rapid growth in  horticulture, poultry and aquaculture expanded its food basket.

Today, India is not just feeding its 1.4 billion people but, as the world's eighth-largest agri-produce exporter, also shipping grains, fruits and dairy worldwide.

Yet, despite such major gains, Indian agriculture still lags in productivity, infrastructure and market access. Global price volatility and climate change add to the challenge. Crop yields lag far behind the global best. Small landholdings worsen the problem - Indian farmers work with less than a hectare on average, while their American counterparts had over 46 hectares in 2020.

No surprise then that productivity remains low, even though farming remains India's backbone, supporting over 700 million people, nearly half the country's population. Agriculture employs nearly half of India's workforce but accounts for just 15% of GDP. In comparison, less than 2% of the US population depends on farming. With limited manufacturing jobs, more people are stuck in low-paying farm work, an unusual trend for a developing country.

This structural imbalance also shapes India's trade policies. Despite its farm surplus, India keeps tariffs high to shield its farmers from cheap imports. It maintains moderate to high tariffs - ranging from zero to 150% - on farm imports.

The weighted average tariff - the average duty rate per imported product - in India on US farm products is 37.7%, compared to 5.3% on Indian agricultural goodsin the US, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).

Bilateral farm trade between India and the US is modest, at just $8bn (£6.2bn).

India mainly exports rice, shrimp, honey, vegetable extracts, castor oil and black pepper, while the US sends almonds, walnuts, pistachios, apples and lentils.

But as the two countries work on atrade deal, experts say Washington now wants to push ""big-ticket"" farm exports - wheat, cotton, corn and maize - to narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.

""They're not looking to export berries and stuff this time. The game is much bigger,"" says Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank.

Pushing India to lower farm tariffs, cut price support and open up to genetically modified (GM) crops and dairy ignores the fundamental asymmetry in global agriculture, experts argue.

The US, for instance, heavily subsidises its agriculture and protects farmers through crop insurance.

""In some cases,"" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, ""US subsidies exceed 100% of production costs, creating an uneven playing field that could devastate India's smallholder farmers.""

Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, says ""the key thing to remember is that agriculture in the two countries is entirely different"".

""The US has commercial agriculture, while India relies on intensive, subsistence farming. It's a question of the livelihoods of millions of Indians versus the interests of US agribusiness.""

But India's agricultural challenges aren't just external. Mr Dhar says much of the sector's struggles are ""its own doing"". Farming has long been underfunded, receiving less than 6% of India's total investment - funds meant for infrastructure, machinery and other long-term assets crucial for growth.

To protect millions of livelihoods, the government shields key crops like wheat, rice and dairy with import duties and price support. ""But even that doesn't inspire confidence,"" he says.

Four years ago,tens of thousands of farmers held protestsdemanding better prices and legal guarantees of minimum government support-price for staples, mainly wheat and rice.

""Even relatively well-off farmers selling surpluses don't see a turnaround anytime soon. And if they feel that way, imagine the plight of subsistence farmers,"" says Mr Dhar.

Beyond domestic discontent, trade negotiations add another layer of complexity.

Mr Das says the real challenge for India will be how ""to have an agreement with the US that takes into account US export interest in agriculture while balancing India's interests in the farm sector"".

So what's the way forward?

""India must not yield to US pressure to open its agriculture sector,"" says Mr Srivastava. He warns that doing so would disrupt millions of livelihoods, threaten food security and flood local markets with cheap imports.

""India must prioritise its national interest and protect its rural economy. Trade cooperation should not come at the cost of our farmers, food sovereignty or policy autonomy.""

In the long run, experts say India must modernise its agriculture, making farming more remunerative, and become more competitive to boost exports. Unupom Kausik of agri-business Olam estimates that with top global yields, India could generate a surplus of 200 million metric tonnes of paddy - enough to supply global trade and combat hunger.

""In a way, Trump is holding up a mirror to us. We've done little to invest in agriculture's productive capacity,"" says Mr Dhar. ""For now, buying time is the best strategy - maybe offering the US cheaper imports of industrial goods as a trade-off.""

But for the best outcome, he says, India will have to ""play hardball. Basically, tell the US - we're open to negotiations on other fronts, but don't destabilise our agriculture"".

Clearly India's challenge is to negotiate from a position of strength - offering just enough to keep Washington at the table while safeguarding its rural backbone. After all, in global trade as in farming, timing and patience often yield the best harvest. The jury is out on whether Trump is willing to wait.

They met for 30 seconds - she then stalked him for four years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y9134jy0jo,BBC,Darragh MacIntyre,31-03-25,"The meeting between motivational speaker Brad Burton and Sam Wall lasted less than a minute. She posed for a picture with him after attending one of his workshops and later left a glowing video testimonial.

It was unremarkable, Brad says. ""Just one of the thousands of people I must have met over the years.""

Two years later, she started attacking him online.

In hundreds of posts, Wall described him as manipulative, a psychopath and a sociopathic abuser. Day after day, she accused him of making death threats, breaking her windows and killing her cat - all false allegations.

""She put it on social media across all platforms. She was painting a picture that, somewhere along the way, I had done all these things and I was trying to cover it up,"" Brad tells BBC Panorama.

""How do you prove a negative? That I had not poisoned the cat? Social media and the way it works, it's guilty until proven innocent.""

Wall, 55, a social media consultant, pleaded guilty to charges of stalking and sending false messages at Manchester Magistrates' Court last November.

Her sentencing was delayed for a second time last week, but the judge told her to expect a prison sentence.

Wall's legal team said a psychiatric report shows she has a chronic delusional mental health illness.

Her conviction was in relation to two victims - Brad and businesswoman Naomi Timperley - who were targeted with abusive messages over the past four years.

""It's just been hideous, really hideous, and I don't know why it happened,"" Naomi tells us. ""I'm still really anxious, sometimes I get really sad.""

BBC Panorama has spoken to other victims who say they were stalked by Wall over a period of more than 10 years.

Some had never met Wall, while others only knew her as a passing acquaintance.

At the time Wall targeted Brad, he was running a network supporting hundreds of small businesses across the UK.

Many of her abusive posts were detailed - one was 20,000 words long. Some were shared on LinkedIn, where she had 30,000 followers - the very platform Brad relied on to promote his work.

While the pandemic hit him hard, he says she helped to sink his business.

Wall also falsely claimed that Brad had in fact been harassing her for 10 years - and that he had been arrested and jailed.

Brad posted pictures of himself online to prove he was not in prison. Wall responded by claiming Brad's psychopathic twin was taking the photos and appearing at events to cover up the fact he had been locked up.

His friend Alan Price knew Wall was lying about the 10-year claim, because he had introduced them at the workshop two years earlier.

""She's telling everybody that Brad Burton is in jail, but I was actually out in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset having a curry with him,"" he says.

In an attempt to stop her, Brad went to a solicitor who advised him to send a cease and desist letter. Wall then responded by publishing the letter online and saying he could sue her - but she had no money.

Tech consultant Naomi Timperley had only met Wall in passing - she followed her on Twitter and they were connected on LinkedIn. She was also targeted with hundreds of messages - accused of criminal damage, destroying Wall's business and of joining up with others to carry out so-called gang stalking.

Wall also falsely claimed Naomi had been arrested for harassment.

""I've been personally attacked on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook and accused of really vile things,"" Naomi tells us.

Wall continued her online attacks even after she had been charged with stalking.

Manchester-based entrepreneur Justine Wright was targeted over a decade. She had employed Wall for a couple of months and, when Wall left, the online stalking began.

Justine is a marketing consultant and Wall repeatedly targeted her clients - major companies - with false claims. Justine had never met Brad, but Wall accused her of conspiring with him to poison her cat.

People might be surprised by the number of victims and that Wall did not disguise her identity, says Rory Innes, chief executive of the Cyber Helpline, a charity that helps victims of online crime.

But he says this is common.

""It's a horrendous case and she will be causing harm to lots of people and changing their lives. But this is happening to hundreds of thousands of people every year.""

Panorama has spoken to other victims who do not want to be identified. One says he was stalked for more than a decade, during which time Wall sent thousands of texts, plus 10,000-word emails to his friends and business contacts.

Wall would also turn up at his work pretending to be his wife, he says, and accusing him of domestic abuse.

All of the victims complained to the social media companies about Wall's posts, but they have not been taken down.

Social media lawyer Paul Tweed tells Panorama he was not surprised the companies had failed to help.

""They decide what should be taken down, they decide when it should be taken down and how it should be taken down. And they will say, when you ask them, that they comply with the law,"" he says.

LinkedIn says it can't comment on individual users, but it does not allow bullying or harassment and it will take action against anything that violates its policies. Instagram, Facebook and X did not respond to Panorama's request for comment.

None of the companies have taken down Wall's abusive messages, even though Panorama told them about Wall's conviction two months ago.

Last week, she posted another abusive message about Brad.

The charity Cyber Helpline has estimated that 600,000 people report online stalking to the police every year. Another charity, the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, says fewer than 2% of stalking and harassment complaints end with a conviction.

A major review by policing bodies last year found a lack of understanding of online stalking and evidence of the police failing to take it seriously.

The advice to victims of online stalking is basic - don't engage, keep records and report it to the police. But the people Panorama spoke to did that, and the abuse continued.

Brad and Naomi were unhappy with the response they got from Greater Manchester Police (GMP).

Outcomes for victims are really poor, Roy Innes from the Cyber Helpline says.

""So few of these cases actually end up with an investigation,"" he says. ""And when an investigation does happen, the technology element can mean it takes years to get to the point where the evidence is being looked at.""

A spokesperson for GMP says delays in the wider criminal justice system affected Wall's case and the force achieved positive outcomes for more than 3,000 victims of this type of crime last year.

We approached Wall for comment, but she did not respond.

Meanwhile, Brad says he forgives her. ""I hope she gets the help that she needs and she finds peace in her own life,"" he says.

Richard Chamberlain: Heartthrob king of the TV mini-series,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxe2nv0mdv2o,BBC,Rachel Hagan,30-03-25,"Richard Chamberlain, who has died today at the age of 90, shot to fame as TV heartthrob Dr Kildare in the 1960s.

His dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.

But, in middle age, his career spiked again.

Chamberlain became king of the 1980's TV mini-series: playing a western prisoner in Shogun and a catholic priest tempted by love in The Thorn Birds.

He denied being gay when confronted by a French magazine in 1989, and did not speak publicly about his homosexuality until he turned 70.

In interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.

""There's still a tremendous amount of homophobia in our culture,"" he said. ""Please, don't pretend that we're suddenly all wonderfully, blissfully accepted.""

George Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.

His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a ""shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face"".

He admitted to being the most ""uncooperative kid in school"" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics.

At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.

Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.

On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.

Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.

He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his ""fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance"".

But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.

""Perhaps it was inevitable,"" said one friend-and-rival. ""Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?""

The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.

It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.

There was a huge reaction from female fans.

Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.

The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.

Fans would even write in asking ""Dr Kildare"" to solve their various medical problems.

And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.

He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.

Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.

In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.

Audiences, they said, laughed in ""all the wrong places"". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.

He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.

The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'

In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.

And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.

This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.

But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.

The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.

Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.

He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.

In 1977, the TV series Roots - set in the era of American slavery - drew huge audiences and was nominated for nearly 40 Emmy awards.

It sparked a revival of the mini-series which drew Chamberlain back to television.

He beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.

The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.

Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.

It was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.

In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.

There were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.

These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.

In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.

Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.

""I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,"" he said, ""and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.""

Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.

In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.

He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.

But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.

""I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,"" he told El Pais in 2024. ""But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.""

He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.

Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.

For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience.

Man tending grave probed for starting South Korea fires,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3e35y3qqo,BBC,Vicky Wong,30-03-25,"A 56-year-old man is being investigated in South Korea on suspicion of starting a deadly wildfire that killed 30 people.

The man, who has not been named, was performing an ancestral rite by a family grave on a hill in Uiseong county, North Gyeongsang province, at the time.

He has been booked - but not arrested - and will be called in for questioning once the investigation of the site has been completed. He denies the charges.

On Sunday, officials said the main fire had finally been brought under complete control - 10 days after it started, causing widespread damage to buildings, including historic temples.

Investigators reportedly spoke to the suspect's daughter, who is said to have told them that the fire began as her father tried to burn tree branches hanging over the graves with a cigarette lighter.

The fires subsequently burned more than 48,000 hectares - equivalent to about 80% of the area of the capital, Seoul - according to the Korea Forest Service.

They also destroyed an estimated 4,000 structures, including homes, factories and a number of national treasures.

Goun Temple - a Unesco World Heritage Site - was among the structures destroyed in the blaze. It was built in AD618 and was one of the largest in the province.

Most of the casualties were people in their 60s and 70s.

Even though the main fire has been brought under control, smaller ones continue to reignite, authorities say.

Fuelled by strong and dry winds, the fires spread to several cities and counties.

Unseasonably warm weather, dry conditions and pine forests in the region also helped exacerbate the fires.

An investigation involving the police, fire authorities and forest management will be carried out next week.

South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo said the government would provide financial support for those who had been displaced by the fires.

Police visit over mushroom picking alarms British forager,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2xex0mj3mo,BBC,Dan Martin,30-03-25,"A woman says police overreacted by trying to ban her from a park over allegations she was illegally foraging for mushrooms.

Louise Gather said a police officer came to her home and attempted to issue her with a community resolution report after she visited Bradgate Park, in Leicestershire, in search of magpie inkcaps - a rare kind of fungus.

It follows a complaint by the Bradgate Park Trust, which runs the park, that Mrs Gather picked mushrooms illegally because it is a designated site of special scientific interest (SSSI).

The 38-year-old insisted she had not picked any mushrooms during her visit in November, and that Leicestershire Police's actions had been ""a bit excessive"".

Mrs Gather, from Derby, revealed details of the community resolution order on TikTok this week.

Under the terms of the community resolution report, an informal agreement between a complainant and an alleged offender, Mrs Gather was told she would not face prosecution or get a criminal record if she stuck to its terms.

These also included her agreeing not to take items from the park in the future, and that she would look into what an SSSI is.

However, police have subsequently admitted that the order was not valid because the officer dealing with the case mistakenly got her husband to sign the agreement, rather than her.

Mrs Gather said the first time she became aware of any problem was on 25 November, when an officer from Leicestershire Police came to her home and said a complaint had been made.

She said: ""It seems someone had followed me, taken pictures of my car registration and passed them on to police.

""I was out when [the officer] came but my husband was home - and he thought I'd been in a car accident or something.

""The police officer was pretty good about it - I think he just wanted to get it sorted as quickly as possible - but he got my husband to sign something, which was an informal agreement that I don't go back to the park - so he'd go.

""It turns out that was a mistake and the officer's boss phoned me on Thursday to say it had been rescinded. He was very, very apologetic.

""The whole thing feels a bit silly. I don't think much common sense has been used.

""It was a bit excessive to send a policeman to my house - especially as I didn't pick anything from the park.

""I understand Bradgate Park is an SSSI. Why would I want to do anything to harm that environment?""

""I do sometimes forage, usually for wild garlic and wild leeks,"" said Mrs Gather.

""And on that day I was looking for magpie inkcaps, which are quite rare, and I had been tipped off they were growing there.

""My interest in fungi started a few years ago. I started to notice them while I was walking the dog then I'd go home and look them up. It moved on from there.

""Magpie inkcaps were on my mushroom bucket list. Occasionally I do forage mushrooms, but on that day I didn't pick anything.

""I spoke to a couple of volunteers and had a lovely conversation with them.

""They told me where they thought I might find what I was looking for - and I did find them.

""I had my foraging basket but I didn't put anything in it. I was happy - I was there about an hour and even had lunch in the cafe.

""There were rangers buzzing about on their buggies. Nobody seemed to think anything was wrong at the time. Nobody asked to look in my basket.""

According to Leicestershire Police, the complainant said it was reported Mrs Gather had a small knife, which meant they did not feel able to approach her.

She said: ""I had my tiny mushroom foraging knife. That's all. It has a folding blade but I don't think I even got it out.""

A spokesperson for Leicestershire Police said a report of a woman picking mushrooms had been received, and added: ""Inquiries were carried out into the report and an officer visited the woman's home address, where a community resolution was issued in relation to the offence.

""Bradgate Park is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), which is covered by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Nature Conservation Act 2004.

""The park is of high conservation value and should be protected as part of his heritage.

""The removal of any item from the park is an offence and officers will carry out inquiries into any reports of this nature which are made to us.""

The Bradgate Park Trust declined to comment.

"Rare Roman coin fetches nearly £5,000 at auction",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mwm8nw914o,BBC,"Charlotte Benton, Gavin Kermack",30-03-25,"A Roman coin that is believed to be the first of its kind found in the UK has sold for nearly £5,000.

Ron Walters, 76, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, found the coin with his metal detector in Wall Heath near Dudley last year.

Mark Hannam, from Fieldings Auctioneers in Stourbridge, said the coin was bought by a collector from Scotland for £4,700 on Friday.

""Even though it's been in the soil for over 1,900 years, he's very pleased to add it to his collection,"" said Mr Hannam.

The coin, which dates to AD69, is thought to be the only one of its kind to be found in the British Isles.

It portrays the emperor Aulus Vitellius, who ruled for just eight months during a period of civil war known as the ""Year of the Four Emperors"".

""To find a coin from AD69 is incredibly rare,"" said Mr Hannam. ""Most coins we find in this country are from the third and fourth centuries, and we are talking about a time when the gold was at its purest level.""

The farmer on whose land the coin was unearthed will keep half the proceeds from the sale and Mr Walters, as the finder, will get the rest.

""It's not just the money,"" he said before the sale. ""It's the historic value.

""It's a once in a lifetime find.""

The coin went for considerably less than the only other similar artefact to go under the hammer, which was sold last year in Switzerland for around £50,000.

But Mr Walters told BBC Radio WM he was happy with the sale.

""Anything's a bonus,"" he said. ""Normally the things that you find, you put in your collection because they're not worth selling on.""

He is planning to put the proceeds towards some repairs to his motorhome - and to continue with his metal-detecting hobby.

""It's surprising what comes up – not just coins, it can be anything.

""Belt buckles, buttons - they've all got a story to tell.""

Trump says he 'couldn't care less' about higher car prices,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgj51gl25o,BBC,"Vicky Wong, Nadine Yousif",30-03-25,"Donald Trump has said he ""couldn't care less"" if carmakers raise prices after his 25% tariffs on foreign-made vehicles comes into effect.

Some analysts have warned that Trump's import charges could lead to the temporary shutdown of some US car production, with increased prices passed onto consumers.

But the US president told NBC News on Saturday that he hoped foreign carmakers will raise prices as it meant ""people are gonna buy American-made cars - we have plenty"".

On Wednesday, Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts entering the US to begin on 2 April. Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.

When asked about what his message was to car bosses, he said: ""The message is congratulations. If you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money.""

He continued: ""If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.""

Recent polling by BBC's US partner CBS News suggests that consumers are worried the tariffs will raise prices, with 72% indicating that they believe costs will increase in the short-term. More than half of respondents said the Trump administration is not focusing enough on lowering costs for Americans.

Asked about this sentiment on Sunday, Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro asked people to put their trust in the US president.

""Trust in Trump,"" Navarro told Fox News, adding that previous tariffs on China by the US have led to ""prosperity and price stability"".

""The reason why we will not see inflation is because foreigners are going to eat most of it, they have to,"" he said, adding that the US ""is the biggest market in the world.""

Shawn Fain, the leader of union United Auto Workers, criticised Trump for his labour and immigration policies on CBS Face the Nation - but he said tariffs were a necessary ""tool in the toolbox"" to return manufacturing to the US.

""There is plenty of opportunity. And I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.""

The 25% import tax on carmakers from Canada and Mexico wasbriefly implemented but then pausedat the beginning of March, following pleas from major North American manufacturers like Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.

But Trump told NBC that he did not plan to delay the tariffs on cars any longer, saying he would consider negotiating ""only if people are willing to give us something of great value - because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation"".

In another interview with NBC News on Sunday, he threatened to impose secondary tariffs of 25-50% on Russian oil if he feels Vladimir Putin is stalling progress on Ukraine peace talks.

""If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia's fault - which it might not be - but if I think it was Russia's fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,"" he told the outlet.

""There will be a 25% tariff on oil and other products sold in the United States, secondary tariffs,"" Trump said, adding that tariffs on Russia would come within a month without a ceasefire deal.

Trump said Putin knows he is angry, but that he has ""a very good relationship"" with the Russian president.

He went on to say that ""the anger dissipates quickly"" but only if Putin ""he does the right thing"".

Trump said he will speak to Putin again this week.

Analysts say the upcoming tariffs that Trump has planned could further strain relations with some of the US's main trading partners.

Trump's comments come as Downing Street sources said theUK would not hesitate to retaliate against US tariffs if needed.

The UK is in last-minute negotiations with the White House and is trying to get an exemption, arguing that - unlike other countries - the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he does not want to jump into a trade war.

Several major economies have also vowed to retaliate in response to Trump's tariffs.

Germany has said it ""will not give in"" and thatEurope must ""respond firmly"", while France's president branded the move ""a waste of time"" and ""incoherent"".

Canada has called it a ""direct attack"", and China accused Washington of violating international trade rules.

Kink and LGBT dating apps exposed 1.5m private user images online,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05m5m5v327o,BBC,Joe Tidy,30-03-25,"Researchers have discovered nearly 1.5 million pictures from specialist dating apps – many of which are explicit – being stored online without password protection, leaving them vulnerable to hackers and extortionists.

Anyone with the link was able to view the private photos from five platforms developed by M.A.D Mobile: kink sites BDSM People and Chica, and LGBT apps Pink, Brish and Translove.

These services are used by an estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people.

M.A.D Mobile was first warned about the security flaw on 20 January but didn't take action until the BBC emailed on Friday.

They have since fixed it but not said how it happened or why they failed to protect the sensitive images.

Ethical hacker Aras Nazarovas from Cybernews first alerted the firm about the security hole after finding the location of the online storage used by the apps by analysing the code that powers the services.

He was shocked that he could access the unencrypted and unprotected photos without any password.

""The first app I investigated was BDSM People, and the first image in the folder was a naked man in his thirties,"" he said.

""As soon as I saw it I realised that this folder should not have been public.""

The images were not limited to those from profiles, he said – they included pictures which had been sent privately in messages, and even some which had been removed by moderators.

Mr Nazarovas said the discovery of unprotected sensitive material comes with a significant risk for the platforms' users.

Malicious hackers could have found the images and extorted individuals.

There is also a risk to those who live in countries hostile to LGBT people.

None of the text content of private messages was found to be stored in this way and the images are not labelled with user names or real names, which would make crafting targeted attacks at users more complex.

In an email M.A.D Mobile said it was grateful to the researcher for uncovering the vulnerability in the apps to prevent a data breach from occurring.

But there's no guarantee that Mr Nazarovas was the only hacker to have found the image stash.

""We appreciate their work and have already taken the necessary steps to address the issue,"" a M.A.D Mobile spokesperson said. ""An additional update for the apps will be released on the App Store in the coming days.""

The company did not respond to further questions about where the company is based and why it took months to address the issue after multiple warnings from researchers.

Usually security researchers wait until a vulnerability is fixed before publishing an online report, in case it puts users at further risk of attack.

But Mr Nazarovas and his team decided to raise the alarm on Thursday while the issue was still live as they were concerned the company was not doing anything to fix it.

""It's always a difficult decision but we think the public need to know to protect themselves,"" he said.

In 2015 malicious hackers stole a large amount of customer data about users of Ashley Madison, a dating website for married people who wish to cheat on their spouse.

Last shot at glory for 'legends'? Guardiola still burning with desire,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9ve8xz4yv0o,BBC,Phil McNulty,30-03-25,"This video can not be played

FA Cup highlights: Bournemouth 1-2 Manchester City

Pep Guardiola's frantic body language released every frustration suffered in a season of mediocrity as the clouds lifted and the sun finally shone on Manchester City at Bournemouth.

Guardiola has cut a tortured, agonised figure for most of a campaign in which the form of his City side fell off a cliff after claiming a historic four successive Premier League titles.

It left the FA Cup as the only target left to stop Guardiola suffering the rare ignominy of finishing a season empty-handed for the first time since his opening one at City in 2016-17 - which was the only campaign he has not won a trophy as a manager.

And watching Guardiola at close quarters at Vitality Stadium as City came from behind to win 2-1 made a mockery of Guardiola's own assertion that not even winning the FA Cup could make up for failing to make a dent in the Premier League and Champions League.

It was pure theatre watching a man so used to glory - who lives for success - exude relief, celebration and then uncontained joy when City deservedly got over the line.

This was Guardiola publicly savouring the sweet taste of victory after so often failing to find solutions to the crisis, certainly by their own standards, that has dragged City down this term.

He said City came to the Vitality ""with flip-flops"" when they suffered their first Premier League defeat of the season in November. This was strictly business.

""In November, we came here for a holiday against a team that competes,"" he added.

The only thing that smacked of a holiday here was the glorious south-coast weather as British Summer Time arrived - and City had to survive a storm of their own making before securing the win.

From the first minute, Guardiola burned with desire for victory, a livewire in the technical area throughout and at the final whistle after a win that sealed a remarkable seventh successive FA Cup semi-final appearance, this time against Nottingham Forest.

And, as all the great managers do, Guardiola still kept his analytical mind ice-cold throughout the fiery touchline behaviour to make the change that turned the tide of this quarter-final when City trailed to Evanilson's scrambled goal at the interval.

Guardiola removed the struggling central defender Abdukodir Khusanov, switching Josko Gvardiol into the middle and introducing talented 20-year-old Nico O'Reilly at left-back.

O'Reilly's natural position, as Guardiola confirmed, is a number 10, but here he did damage on the flanks, setting up an equaliser for Erling Haaland, who had missed a first-half penalty, then played in substitute Omar Marmoush for the winner.

Star players make step up, says Guardiola

Youngster Nico O'Reilly is embraced by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola after setting up two goals in their FA Cup quarter-final win

At the heart of it all was Guardiola - excitable, animated and showing with every action just how important the FA Cup is to him and City.

Even by his own standards, Guardiola has rarely looked as engaged and involved as this.

He has a huge rebuild on his hands, and some cracks were still visible here, with an ageing squad containing the players he described as ""legendary"" called into action such as Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin de Bruyne.

This might be the last shot at glory as City players for some.

And the use of Matheus Nunes at right-back, a position even his greatest admirers would not suggest he has the qualities for, showed how Guardiola has had an air of desperation about some resources he has juggled this season.

This was, however, about the here and now - not the future. The old trophy-winning muscle memory of Guardiola and his players kicked in when it mattered.

If the FA Cup really is struggling to count as a consolation prize for Guardiola and City this season, you could have fooled everyone inside this ground who watched him.

Winning the cup would not disguise the scale of the renewal Guardiola must oversee to restore City to their former eminence, but the great old prize will certainly be something to be going on with.

The club also expects to learn the outcome of the hearing into115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breachesimminently.

Guardiola's fist-pumping reaction to Haaland's equaliser was a wild outpouring of joy, as was his reaction to Marmoush's winner. The manager even picked up a booking for an altercation with the officials.

Haaland suffered a mixed day, missing a third penalty from his past six attempts, then limping off with an ankle injury after his goal.

The strike for the equaliser means he is the first player to score 30 goals or more in all competitions in each of his first three seasons while playing for Premier League clubs since Ruud van Nistelrooy for Manchester Utd from 2001-02 to 2003-04.

It looked like it was all Guardiola could do to stop himself entering the action at some points, mixing applause for his players with furious expressions of discontent at moments of carelessness.

And at the final whistle Guardiola's elation overflowed in front of City fans basking in the glorious sunshine.

He marched at pace around every player, wrapping them in fierce bear hugs and even planting kisses on some.

Guardiola then joined the celebrations with the travelling supporters, conducting their ""We've got Guardiola"" anthem along with other songs before grabbing the young hero O'Reilly, shoving him towards the stands to take the acclaim his match-winning turn deserved.

And who can blame Guardiola, as O'Reilly is emerging as City's FA Cup talisman?

He has been directly involved in five goals in four appearances in the competition this season, with three goals and two assists.

O'Reilly is also the first City substitute to assist two goals in a game since Gundogan against Leeds United in December 2021.

Guardiola said: ""Nico is a number 10. He possesses such quality in the final third and has so much vision. We thought he could do it for us on the left as well, and he did.""

If Guardiola is looking for vital signs of a brighter future, the composure and class of O'Reilly certainly provides one.

The Spaniard added: ""We played an outstanding game and had incredible chances, missed a penalty. We conceded with one chance we gave away. Our approach was magnificent.

""Seven times in a row into the semi-final of the FA Cup. No team has done it and it will be difficult for any other to do what these legendary players, the new ones and the old ones, will have done.""

And as City move within sight of another trophy, Guardiola proved once more that even amid unaccustomed struggles, old trophy-winning habits die hard for great managers and players.

'His swagger is back' but Villa won't 'waste time' on Rashford future,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czx4lp78vp7o,BBC,Simon Stone,30-03-25,"This video can not be played

Pundits on Rashford's MOTM performance against Preston

Marcus Rashford has got his swagger back.

The Aston Villa loanee ended his 120-day goal drought with a second-half double at Preston on Sunday to help Unai Emery's side set up an FA Cup semi-final against Crystal Palace - and provide another clear sign he is enjoying his football again.

Frozen out of the first-team picture at Manchester United by head coach Ruben Amorim just weeks after he replaced Erik ten Hag at the helm, even those closest to Rashford accepted he had a major point to prove when he completed his loan move to Aston Villa on 3 February.

Those working with him can see the improvement in Rashford, maybe not quite to the levels of old but certainly a far cry from the passive figure he appeared at Old Trafford for most of the previous 18 months.

England boss Thomas Tuchel must have felt so too, judging by the speed with which he restored Rashford to the international fold earlier this month.

Yet there were plenty of doubters. They were out in force on social media during the first half of Villa's 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final victory at Preston, as Rashford wasted a couple of free-kicks as the visitors struggled to turn their dominance into goals.

The only measure, though, of a striker's success is the regularity they hit the back of the net - and he hadn't done it for 14 games and counting since his double for United against Everton on 1 December.

But when Lucas Digne presented the opportunity 13 minutes into the second half at Deepdale, Rashford's innate ability did the rest as he calmly picked his spot before finding the bottom corner.

Five minutes later, despite a wait for the video assistant referee (VAR) to confirm Villa should be awarded a penalty, and goalkeeper David Cornell offering some 'advice' as he walked past to take up his position, Rashford's nerve held. He took his time, did an extended stuttering run-up, and found the net.

""The swagger is back,"" gushed Guy Mowbray in his Match of the Day commentary. ""The confidence and the pose.""

""It's a great feeling,"" Rashford told BBC Sport afterwards: ""It's always nice for a forward to get a goal, so hopefully it continues.

""I feel like I've been getting fitter and playing better football since I've been here. I missed a lot of football before joining up with them. My body feels good and I'm enjoying my football for now.""

Rashford scores first Villa goals within space of five minutes

The deal United struck with Villa to let Rashford leave is not straightforward.

The precise nature of the loan deal is complicated. United have said 75% of Rashford's wages are being covered, although they have not explained exactly how.

That could rise to 90% if certain performance-related bonuses are met.

That, presumably, will include an extended run in the Champions League - Villa have been paired with French heavyweights Paris St-Germain in the quarter-finals - as well as the FA Cup.

Unai Emery's side face Crystal Palace at Wembley next month as the next step in their quest to win the trophy for the first time since 1957.

In addition, they are ninth in the Premier League, three points behind fifth-placed Manchester City, who occupy what is virtually certain to be the final Champions League spot.

That proliferation of targets underscores why Emery did not really want to talk about the likelihood of Villa triggering their Â£40m option to turn Rashford's move into a permanent deal.

""We can't waste time speaking about that,"" he said

""If next year we are in the Champions League, in the Europa, or Conference League or not. Or we don't win a trophy - it is completely different.""

Marcus Rashford (left) celebrates his second goal for Aston Villa at Preston

Unlike Villa, Rashford has won the FA Cup twice in recent memory, including last season. He has also been part of teams who have won the Europa League and EFL Cup. In addition, he has 60 England caps. His past playbook means if he can reach the standards he has previously set, he would be an asset to any side in the world.

It is that talent Emery is trying to coax out of the player. It is, in the modern football vocabulary, 'a process'.

The Aston Villa boss, said: ""There is still work, still weeks to get it, but today he did one step forward. He is feeling comfortable, getting confident and scoring goals. He was obviously getting better, but today it was more in his adaptation and helping us.

""He's playing in the idea, in the plan we did with him. He has played more as a winger on the left side but he's played in some moments as a striker. Today we decided to play him as a striker to his quality, his power and the way he exploits things.

""The process we have with him is more or less not changing. There is still work to do because he came here after not training consistently and not feeling in his best fitness. Progressively playing more and with the national team will help him to feel better and today was confirmation of that, which is good.""

The painful divorce of Marcus Rashford and Manchester United

The good thing from Rashford's perspective is he is beginning to put together a positive body of work to counter the extended period of drift he experienced at United.

It still feels bizarre he has left his boyhood club for a perceived smaller rival, yet finds himself entering the final two months of the campaign with substantially more to play for - both in number and prestige of competitions - than he would have had if he remained at Old Trafford.

No professional career is a straight line ascent, which is why insight from those who have been there and done it is so valuable.

""You are constantly being asked questions at the top,"" said former England keeper Joe Hart on Match of the Day.

""Maybe Rashford found himself in a lull but he has come to Villa with people around him that know what they are doing. He hasn't come here with question marks about how he is going to behave and what he is going to do and how he can change the team.""

Hart found himself frozen out for a time at Manchester City and Micah Richards did not have the greatest time at Aston Villa.

But, like Hart, Rashford can see how a change of scenery has provided the impetus for improvement.

""He looks confident and happy,"" said Richards.

""It was a big move going to Villa. But when you've got a manager that believes in you, you can do special things.

""His whole body language looks a lot better and his all-round game was brilliant. That is the best way to shut people up. People were asking questions about not fulfilling his potential but that is the way to answer.

""I really like Rashford in these wide areas because he's always looking to run in behind.

When I talk about body language and his movement - his all round game today was brilliant.""

Another milestone - but when could Kane win first trophy?,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c89gw8738k8o,BBC,Gary Rose,30-03-25,"Harry Kane has scored 22 goals in the Bundesliga this season

If you've played against Harry Kane in the Bundesliga, then he's scored against you.

The England captain's goalagainst St Pauli on Saturdaymeans he has now scored against all 19 clubs he has faced in the league in Germany.

Only Miroslav Klose - Germany's all-time top scorer - has faced more clubs in the Bundesliga and scored against them all (28).

It comes after Kane achieved the same feat in England, with the former Tottenham striker scoring against all 32 clubs he faced in the Premier League.

His latest Bundesliga strike ended his mini-drought of five games and means he remains the league's top scorer, increasing his tally to 22 goals.

It helped Bayern to a 3-2 victory and moved Kane a step closer to winning his first major trophy, with Bayern six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga.

Kane moved to Bayern from Tottenham in August 2023 and has now scored 58 goals in 57 Bundesliga games.

That is more than any other player in that time, with the nearest challenger being Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, who has scored 49 goals in 56 league appearances since the start of  the 2023-24 season.

Manchester City's Erling Haaland, meanwhile, has 48 league goals in 59 appearances.

Expanding it to all competitions, no player has scored more goals than Kane in Europe's top five leagues, with his 77 level with Mbappe.

Kane's scoring prowess means he also has the best minutes-per-goal ratio of any player in Europe's top five leagues to have hit 20 or more goals since the start of last season.

Kane is 31 years old, so time is against him in his pursuit of ending his long wait for a trophy.

Thirteen years at Tottenham did not yield silverware, and even his first full season at Bayern ended with them uncharacteristically failing to win anything.

But finally, he is on course to lift at least one trophy this term, with Bayern closing in on the Bundesliga title.

Bayern are six points clear of Bayer Leverkusen at the top of the table with seven games remaining.

If Vincent Kompany's side win while their rivals lose then the earliest point they would have an unassailable advantage would be 19 April, if they beat Heidenheim on that date.

That scenario is, however, unlikely meaning in its simplest terms Bayern will win the title if they collect five wins from their remaining seven games, regardless of what anyone else does.

Kane could in fact end the season with two trophies, because Bayern are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, where they will face Inter Milan.

Should Bayern win a trophy this season it will mean Kane happily departs a club no-one wants to be in - a trophyless career.

There are many famous players with that unfortunate record.

During the 1990s, Matt le Tissier was widely regarded as one of the most gifted attackers of his generation but never won a trophy.

He spent his entire career at Southampton and was capped eight times by England.

Antonio di Natale was capped 42 times for Italy and played in the final of Euro 2012.

At club level he mainly played for Udinese and was twice top scorer in Serie A but finished his career without a major trophy.

Meanwhile, Yildiray Basturk won 49 caps for Turkey and played the majority of his career in the Bundesliga but never won significant silverware, coming closest when Bayer Leverkusen finished runners-up in 2001-02.

Harry Kane may fancy chasing down the all-time Premier League top scorer record currently held by Alan Shearer

Should Kane win a trophy this season he may feel ready for a new challenge.

The striker has been linked with a return to the Premier League,with reported interest from Liverpool.,external

Kane is contracted to Bayern until 2027 and has indicated he remains very happy at the club.

But there is one record he might like to chase down - the all-time top scorer in the Premier League.

Former Blackburn and Newcastle striker Alan Shearer has long held the record with 260 goals, but Kane is second in the standings with 213.

If he replicates his current scoring rate in the Bundesliga, then he could well surpass Shearer's total within two seasons.

That could prove too tempting a challenge to overlook.

Last shot at glory for 'legends'? Guardiola still burning with desire,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c9ve8xz4yv0o,BBC,Phil McNulty,30-03-25,"This video can not be played

FA Cup highlights: Bournemouth 1-2 Manchester City

Pep Guardiola's frantic body language released every frustration suffered in a season of mediocrity as the clouds lifted and the sun finally shone on Manchester City at Bournemouth.

Guardiola has cut a tortured, agonised figure for most of a campaign in which the form of his City side fell off a cliff after claiming a historic four successive Premier League titles.

It left the FA Cup as the only target left to stop Guardiola suffering the rare ignominy of finishing a season empty-handed for the first time since his opening one at City in 2016-17 - which was the only campaign he has not won a trophy as a manager.

And watching Guardiola at close quarters at Vitality Stadium as City came from behind to win 2-1 made a mockery of Guardiola's own assertion that not even winning the FA Cup could make up for failing to make a dent in the Premier League and Champions League.

It was pure theatre watching a man so used to glory - who lives for success - exude relief, celebration and then uncontained joy when City deservedly got over the line.

This was Guardiola publicly savouring the sweet taste of victory after so often failing to find solutions to the crisis, certainly by their own standards, that has dragged City down this term.

He said City came to the Vitality ""with flip-flops"" when they suffered their first Premier League defeat of the season in November. This was strictly business.

""In November, we came here for a holiday against a team that competes,"" he added.

The only thing that smacked of a holiday here was the glorious south-coast weather as British Summer Time arrived - and City had to survive a storm of their own making before securing the win.

From the first minute, Guardiola burned with desire for victory, a livewire in the technical area throughout and at the final whistle after a win that sealed a remarkable seventh successive FA Cup semi-final appearance, this time against Nottingham Forest.

And, as all the great managers do, Guardiola still kept his analytical mind ice-cold throughout the fiery touchline behaviour to make the change that turned the tide of this quarter-final when City trailed to Evanilson's scrambled goal at the interval.

Guardiola removed the struggling central defender Abdukodir Khusanov, switching Josko Gvardiol into the middle and introducing talented 20-year-old Nico O'Reilly at left-back.

O'Reilly's natural position, as Guardiola confirmed, is a number 10, but here he did damage on the flanks, setting up an equaliser for Erling Haaland, who had missed a first-half penalty, then played in substitute Omar Marmoush for the winner.

Star players make step up, says Guardiola

Forest v Man City, Palace v Villa - semi-final draw

Man City come from behind at Bournemouth to reach FA Cup semi-final

Youngster Nico O'Reilly is embraced by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola after setting up two goals in their FA Cup quarter-final win

At the heart of it all was Guardiola - excitable, animated and showing with every action just how important the FA Cup is to him and City.

Even by his own standards, Guardiola has rarely looked as engaged and involved as this.

He has a huge rebuild on his hands, and some cracks were still visible here, with an ageing squad containing the players he described as ""legendary"" called into action such as Ederson, Bernardo Silva, Ilkay Gundogan and Kevin de Bruyne.

This might be the last shot at glory as City players for some.

And the use of Matheus Nunes at right-back, a position even his greatest admirers would not suggest he has the qualities for, showed how Guardiola has had an air of desperation about some resources he has juggled this season.

This was, however, about the here and now - not the future. The old trophy-winning muscle memory of Guardiola and his players kicked in when it mattered.

If the FA Cup really is struggling to count as a consolation prize for Guardiola and City this season, you could have fooled everyone inside this ground who watched him.

Winning the cup would not disguise the scale of the renewal Guardiola must oversee to restore City to their former eminence, but the great old prize will certainly be something to be going on with.

The club also expects to learn the outcome of the hearing into115 charges of alleged Premier League financial rule breachesimminently.

Guardiola's fist-pumping reaction to Haaland's equaliser was a wild outpouring of joy, as was his reaction to Marmoush's winner. The manager even picked up a booking for an altercation with the officials.

Haaland suffered a mixed day, missing a third penalty from his past six attempts, then limping off with an ankle injury after his goal.

The strike for the equaliser means he is the first player to score 30 goals or more in all competitions in each of his first three seasons while playing for Premier League clubs since Ruud van Nistelrooy for Manchester Utd from 2001-02 to 2003-04.

It looked like it was all Guardiola could do to stop himself entering the action at some points, mixing applause for his players with furious expressions of discontent at moments of carelessness.

And at the final whistle Guardiola's elation overflowed in front of City fans basking in the glorious sunshine.

He marched at pace around every player, wrapping them in fierce bear hugs and even planting kisses on some.

Guardiola then joined the celebrations with the travelling supporters, conducting their ""We've got Guardiola"" anthem along with other songs before grabbing the young hero O'Reilly, shoving him towards the stands to take the acclaim his match-winning turn deserved.

And who can blame Guardiola, as O'Reilly is emerging as City's FA Cup talisman?

He has been directly involved in five goals in four appearances in the competition this season, with three goals and two assists.

O'Reilly is also the first City substitute to assist two goals in a game since Gundogan against Leeds United in December 2021.

Guardiola said: ""Nico is a number 10. He possesses such quality in the final third and has so much vision. We thought he could do it for us on the left as well, and he did.""

If Guardiola is looking for vital signs of a brighter future, the composure and class of O'Reilly certainly provides one.

The Spaniard added: ""We played an outstanding game and had incredible chances, missed a penalty. We conceded with one chance we gave away. Our approach was magnificent.

""Seven times in a row into the semi-final of the FA Cup. No team has done it and it will be difficult for any other to do what these legendary players, the new ones and the old ones, will have done.""

And as City move within sight of another trophy, Guardiola proved once more that even amid unaccustomed struggles, old trophy-winning habits die hard for great managers and players.

Teenager Mensik denies Djokovic 100th title in Miami,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cwyn3lj1qxdo,BBC,Amy Lofthouse,31-03-25,"Jakub Mensik was competing in his second ATP Tour final

Czech teenager Jakub Mensik beat childhood idol Novak Djokovic to win the Miami Open, having come close to withdrawing with a knee injury hours before his first-round match.

Mensik, 19, went to the referee's room to announce his withdrawal before his opener against Roberto Bautista Agut on 20 March, but the official was out for lunch.

He then went to the physiotherapist to ask them to fill in paperwork confirming his withdrawal, but was persuaded to stay on.

""I couldn't walk, I couldn't run,"" he said. ""I started to treat it, started to take painkillers. Nothing was helping.

""I was visiting the referee's office to say 'guys, I'm pulling out', but he was having lunch.""

Mensik went to a physiotherapist, who deemed the injury not to be serious and began treatment to enable him to compete.

""After a few minutes I started to feel a little relief,"" said Mensik, who has risen to a career-high 24th in the world rankings.

""I took different painkillers, which helped a little bit. I was like, 'OK, let's try it. It's like 30 minutes before the match. I can walk. I can run. Let's see'.

""Somehow I won the first round and then I had one day off, which of course, for my knee was much better. Day by day the knee was getting better and with that also my game.""

Mensik dropped just two sets on his run to the final, which included victories over British number one Jack Draper and fourth seed Taylor Fritz.

He clinched a first ATP Tour title with a 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-4) win over Serbia's Djokovic  on a sticky, humid night in Florida.

Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion, had been bidding to become just the third man in the Open era to win 100 singles titles.

However, the 37-year-old's wait will go on after his loss to Mensik, who was just 10 months old when Djokovic won his first title in 2006.

Mensik is the ninth-youngest Masters 1000 champion and the third-youngest in Miami after Carlos Alcaraz and Rafael Nadal.

He is another rising star in the men's game, possessing a huge serve and a thumping backhand that has taken him inside the world's top 50.

Djokovic invited Mensik to practice with him after the 2022 Australian Open when he was still a junior, and Mensik said in his winner's speech that Djokovic was ""the reason I am here"".

He said: ""It's just crazy and unbelievable what he's achieving in this sport during long period of the time.

""Imagine me in 20 years from now, when I will be 39, playing the finals? I hope so, but it's crazy to think about it like this.""

Fourth seed Djokovic warmly congratulated Mensik at the end of the match and said afterwards: ""It hurts me to admit it but you were better.

""I wish you the best of luck. Maybe you'll let me win one of the next times we play.""

Sabalenka powers to Miami Open final win against Pegula

Kasatkina to represent Australia instead of Russia

It has been some rise for Mensik, who broke into the top 100 in February 2024 by reaching the Qatar Open final.

In Miami he beat three top-10 players in Djokovic, Britain's Jack Draper and American Taylor Fritz to lift the biggest title of his career, and handled the pressure of the occasion well.

After a five-and-a-half hour rain delay before the final, settling into a rhythm was not easy, but Mensik adjusted quicker than Djokovic.

He broke Djokovic at the first opportunity and his first serve popped as he rushed out to a 4-1 lead.

Djokovic, by contrast, had a rough start. He fell twice, had to apply eye drops after being bothered by swelling under his right eye and resorted to using sawdust to help him grip his racquet in the humidity.

However, his serve improved as the set progressed and his backhand slice in particular trouble Mensik, who eventually handed the break back.

A tie-break felt inevitable and Djokovic paid for a poor start to it, although he saved two set points before Mensik smashed his way to the opener.

The match was following a similar pattern to their previous meeting in Shanghai last year, when Mensik took the first set on a breaker before fading in the next two.

However, this time he kept up the intensity. Mensik did not face a break point in the second set and the heat and humidity began to take a toll on Djokovic.

Breathing heavily and wiping his face on a towel between every point, Djokovic could only watch as Mensik sent three excellent serves past him to force a tie-break, before the Serb whacked his thigh with his racquet after dropping the opening point in it.

If the point was short, then it was Djokovic who came out on top. But Mensik dug in to the long rallies, sending Djokovic darting around at the back of court and ultimately setting up three match points.

The first one went by as Djokovic sent a superb return right onto the baseline, but Mensik ensured a fitting end with a serve out wide to clinch the second.

He will now rise to a career-high of 24th in the world rankings.

For Djokovic, the wait for a first ATP title since 2023 goes on, but there were signs that his serve in particular has improved under coach Andy Murray.

Seven ejected after brawl in Pistons-Timberwolves,https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/articles/cz95w8e137do,BBC,,31-03-25,"Players from both teams were involved in the melee, including Ron Holland and Donte DiVincenzo

Five players and two coaches were ejected following a brawl during the Minnesota Timberwolves' 123-104 victory against the Detroit Pistons on Sunday.

The highly charged contest in Minneapolis broke into a physical altercation early in the second quarter, when Minnesota's Naz Reid reacted to being bumped by Detroit's Ron Holland during a dribble.

As the two players squared up to one another, members of both teams got involved and the exchange quickly descended into a melee which spilled into the spectator seats at courtside.

Team officials attempted to break up the players, as some spectators deserted their seats.

Even after the fight was broken up, tensions remained high as players from both teams continued verbal attacks on one another.

Officials decided to remove five players - Isaiah Stewart, Holland and Marcus Sasser from Detroit and Reid and Donte DiVincenzo from Minnesota - as well as Detroit head coach John-Blair Bickerstaff and Timberwolves assistant coach Pablo Prigioni.

Bickerstaff accused Prigioni of triggering the incident that saw them both ejected by insulting his players.

""There were things said by their assistant coach,"" Bickerstaff said.

""I'm in the same boat as my guys are in. We're going to defend each other and I'm not going to let people say belligerent things about my guys.

""And it's that simple. So he said what he said. He knows what he said.""

Minnesota head coach Chris Finch later suggested Detroit's physical approach early in the game had triggered the flashpoint.

""I thought leading up to that, the game was way too physical,"" said Finch.

""It was a little lopsided in its physicality and I thought it was bound to happen. It just felt like it was coming.

""We knew they were a super physical team. They hit you, they hold you... but I just thought it got to a point where players were going to take matters into their own hands, and you don't ever want that.""
