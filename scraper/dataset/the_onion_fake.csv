Every meal. Don’t even think about trying to gussy them up with pickle relish.

How else were we to know they weren’t subhuman scum that needed to be wiped off the face of the earth?” Israeli officials went on to clarify that when it came to Palestinians identifying themselves as conscious beings deserving of respect, crying and begging for one’s life did not count as sufficient verification.

It’s clear that adults who were formula-fed as infants face significant disadvantages when it comes to suckling later in life, and this can only be remedied by years of occupational suckling therapy.” Kline concluded by cautioning that despite the encouraging results, those who suckle excessively as infants may develop suckling strength so intense that in adulthood they slurp a nipple clear off the body.

If you hand them a shell to examine, they’ll accuse of having removed the claw-foot bathtub where the turtle takes a sudsy bubble bath and say you are trying to trick them. Across the political spectrum, many people harbor the belief that when a turtle goes to sleep, he puts on a nightcap and pulls a patchwork quilt over him in a canopy bed before blowing out a stub of candle.” At press time, several states had introduced legislation that would require the turtle-apartment theory to be included in high school biology textbooks.

Kennedy Jr. claimed Friday that measles could be cured with a good concealer. “If you contract measles or suspect you have contracted measles, I recommend immediately applying a high-quality, full-coverage liquid or cream color corrector to affected areas,” said Kennedy, who added that HHS was rushing to distribute facial cleanser, foundation, and 10-ounce tubes of L’Oréal Infallible to pharmacies in the region. “Our nation’s top infectious disease doctors recommend anyone who has been exposed to measles immediately use a ring light to assess their skin, apply a dab of 24-hour concealer, and then smooth with a brush or Beautyblender makeup sponge. The truth is, if Americans just had proper access to lightweight cosmetic products capable of hiding blemishes, eliminating uneven skin tone, and highlighting natural complexion, measles could be eradicated.” At press time, Kennedy had released a makeup tutorial where he demonstrated how to apply concealer manufactured by his wife Cheryl Hines’ makeup company for extra measles protection.

Report: More Americans Moving Away From Urban Areas For Rural Life Where They Have Escalating Feud With Beaver,https://theonion.com/report-more-americans-moving-away-from-urban-areas-for-rural-life-where-they-have-escalating-feud-with-beaver/,The Onion,,14-03-25,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Suggesting the reversal of a longstanding historical trend towards urbanization, a report published Tuesday by researchers at Harvard University revealed that more Americans were moving away from cities to pursue a rural life where they have an escalating feud with a beaver. “Our findings indicate there has been a 15% increase in Americans who trade the hustle and bustle of metropolitan life for an agrestic existence in which they dismantle a small beaver dam on their property, leading the determined rodent to seek retribution,” said the report’s lead author, Keith Rawlings, noting that rising rents and concerns about crime had driven even long-term city dwellers to purchase a secluded woodland home whose walls, cabinets, and tables would ultimately be gnawed into a series of elaborate booby traps by the vengeful beaver and his family. “More U.S. citizens are leaving behind the nightlife and cultural events of large urban centers, preferring to spend their disposable income on a faulty beaver-trapping kit, an eccentric exterminator who will end up poisoning himself, and a two-barrel shotgun they will use to destroy their remaining possessions in a desperate pursuit of the elusive semiaquatic mammal. While many say they miss the convenience and variety of cities, they nonetheless prefer a country life in which they realize the beaver would make the perfect mascot for the big ad campaign they’ve been working on and ultimately learn to live in peace with the creature.” Rawlings added that, by contrast, a relatively negligible number of Americans were choosing to leave rural areas in pursuit of an urban life in which they befriend a wise-cracking pigeon.

Elon Musk Creates Federal Employee Revenge Porn Database,https://theonion.com/elon-musk-creates-federal-employee-revenge-porn-database/,The Onion,,11-03-25,"WASHINGTON—Promising to use the U.S. DOGE Service to usher in a new age of government accountability and transparency, Elon Musk ordered the creation of a federal employee revenge porn database this week. “Federal employees have been lazy and unmotivated for years, so to ensure productivity going forward, all government workers must email me private nudes they would never want leaked,” said Musk, who warned members of the U.S. civil service that failing to send in a sexually explicit video in which their face was clearly visible would be considered a resignation. “In the event of insubordination or noncompliance with executive orders, these private porn videos will be immediately posted to Pornhub and other sites using the employee’s full name.

Cackling Hims CEO Threatens To Pull Switch Activating All World’s Erections At Once,https://theonion.com/cackling-hims-ceo-threatens-to-pull-switch-activating-all-worlds-erections-at-once/,The Onion,,7-03-25,"SAN FRANCISCO—Warning that every flaccid member across the globe now represented a ticking time bomb in his hands, cackling Hims CEO Joseph Ludlum released a statement Friday in which he threatened to pull a switch that would activate all the world’s erections at once.

In the three-minute video address, which was broadcast suddenly to millions of screens across the planet, Ludlum dared world leaders to question his resolve and stood before a massive electrically charged array that he referred to as the Universal Engorgement Generator. Sources confirmed that as energy crackled through the minimalist, pastel-colored laboratory in the recording, Ludlum insisted that only if his demands were met could the planet avoid the mass chaos that would ensue if the genitals of countless men were to grow harder than anyone could ever imagine.

“Citizens of Earth, we at Hims have long served as overseers of your sexual health, and today we come with a simple request: $10 trillion by midnight, or we will trigger every last one of your erections,” Joseph Ludlum said in the video, letting out a high-pitched laugh as he marveled at how easy wresting control of the world’s phalluses had been. “For years, you fools have sat idly by, enjoying discreet shipping to your door and chomping down on our Hard Mints like so much candy. Did you ever think to question what all the low prices were for? Did you not realize your lifeless members were slowly becoming marionettes in thrall to my every order?”

“Picture it, if you will: millions and millions of once-limp penises, all growing stiff in an instant with the same active ingredients used in Cialis and Viagra,” Ludlum continued.

Authorities have treated as credible claims that the extensive Hims telehealth network—which gives the company access to billions of erections—could be utilized to create widespread havoc through sudden engorgement, blue balls, and even premature ejaculations. However, officials urged citizens to stay calm and refrain from tampering with their genitalia, stressing that any misstep on their part could immediately set off every erection in a 10-mile radius.

Even as all 193 U.N. member states refused to capitulate to what they called the “ravings of a madman,” the Hims website reportedly updated with a countdown clock and a new “Frequently Asked Questions For Hapless Nitwits” section, which included such entries as “Myths of ED: If you cross the Hims corporation, will your penis inflate so much that it blows up?” “What happens if I already have an erection when the engorgement beam strikes me?” and “If Hims can make me hard whenever they want, can they also make me soft again, and then hard and then soft, so that my member is forever prancing to their mad tune like a dancer to a piper’s song?”

Reports confirmed that each passing minute since the broadcast has brought mounting terror among untold numbers of men who have grown paralyzed with fear at the prospect of losing control of their own genitals, which could become distended with blood and potentially never go flaccid again—a scenario that the Hims executive described in a taunting follow-up warning.

“Can your puny governments not comprehend the consequences of such mass penis-hardening?” Ludlum said in a second video. “Mayhem in the street. Cars driving off roads. Entire city blocks left in ruin. Do you fools dare defy our warnings? Well, then, perhaps a little taste of our stiffening power will show you how serious we truly are.”

“Now, come, my soft little pretties, and rise up for your master’s commands!” he added, throwing a switch that began crackling with electricity as it sent a wave of engorgement through the atmosphere of the Northeastern United States.

With widespread disorder spreading across the region, officials in New York and Boston confirmed boardrooms descended into panicked chaos, planes stalled on runways, and men stared at their penises while screaming in response to the sudden unimaginable rigidity entering their loins. The Centers for Disease Control confirmed that over 12,000 residents were hospitalized with erections that lasted longer than four hours.

The Hims CEO later issued a press release that simply read, “Tick-tock, tick-tock, dear friends,” before signing off as “the Puppetmaster of Phalluses.”

“Now, you fools, midnight fast approaches, and I will turn my device to full blast, demonstrating the true power of my—of my—oh no, I’m…I’m…gahh!” an out-of-breath Ludlum said in his final dispatch, moments after the machine misfired and blasted him with its engorgement beam, causing the CEO to fall to his knees in a gasp of defeat. “Curses! Someone must have meddled with the Premature Ejacu-Ray setting. Hold on. No, it’s fine. Just leave me alone. It’s just… I said it’s fine! Don’t touch me. I just don’t like to be touched afterwards.”

“You haven’t seen the last of me!” he added. “But for now I must go rest and regain my strength.”

Also, attachment to desire is totally okay if what you desire is the intricate musical arrangements and artful melody of Britain’s best prog rock band.

New Evidence Suggests Humans Developed Written Language To Avoid Breaking Up In Person,https://theonion.com/new-evidence-suggests-humans-developed-written-language-to-avoid-breaking-up-in-person/,The Onion,,14-02-25,"CHICAGO—Noting that early humans’ aversion to confrontation played a critical role in their evolution, a new study published Friday in theAmerican Journal Of Archaeologyconcluded that written language was first developed to avoid breaking up in person. “According to our findings, early Mesopotamians created the first cuneiform tablets in 3200 BCE because they couldn’t bear the idea of looking their partner in the eye and ending things face-to-face,” said the study’s author, Professor Jason Greene, who added that once humans learned how effective a breakup note transcribed on papyrus, clay, or animal skin could be, they began developing a variety of symbols to quickly and effectively call a relationship off. “Some of the earliest pictographs, like a broken heart, a withered rose, or crossed out stick figures standing side by side, were seemingly quite effective for avoiding an in-person argument. But based on our evidence, our ancestors eventually developed a phonetic alphabet to convey more complex ideas, like that it might be best for them to open their relationship, or to take a short break and try seeing other people.” Greene added that early humans also developed hunting spears as a way to avoid going through the trouble of divorce.

Nation Vies For   Approval Of Cool Dog,https://theonion.com/nation-vies-for-approval-of-cool-dog/,The Onion,,31-01-25,"WASHINGTON—Hopelessly captivated by the animal’s cheerful energy and striking appearance, the U.S. populace reportedly converged upon a D.C.-area park Tuesday where sources confirmed that all 340 million Americans were vying for the approval of a cool dog.

Several reports indicated the charismatic, carefree border collie, named Scout, was first spotted dashing across Georgetown Waterfront Park, leaping high into the air, catching a Frisbee in his mouth, and then running back to drop the disc at his owner’s feet. Americans across the country were said to have gasped and stopped in their tracks before eagerly making their way to the cool dog, patting their thighs, and complimenting him in a higher-than-normal register.

“Oh my gosh, what an amazing pup,” said Connecticut resident and MRI technician Ken Piper, one of millions who descended upon the park to bend forward and offer the back of their hand for the easy-going canine to sniff. “Just look at that adorable furry face and those perky ears. He’s so calm and composed. He never seems to doubt himself.”

Sources said the entire population circled around Scout and jockeyed for positions near him, kneeling down on the ground and reaching out to shake his paw. The nation reportedly made countless overtures to court the border collie’s favor, such as whistling, jumping up and down, and barking in imitation of him.

In the hours since discovering the cool dog, Americans are believed to have offered him millions of tennis balls, squeaky toys, and knotted tug ropes, though none of the gifts have prompted the animal to reciprocate even a fraction of the interest being directed at him.

“Hey, buddy, look at this stick! Here’s a stick,” said Kansas paralegal Erica Shane, who desperately pleaded for Scout’s attention among throngs of stick-waving Americans before she threw her own stick and it joined a hail of similar projectiles, all of which landed in a massive heap several feet behind the dog. “All right, buddy, goooooo get it!”

Millions of Americans are reported to have watched forlornly as Scout merely scratched at his left ear instead of heeding their frantic cries of “Go get the stick!”

According to a nationwide poll, 81% of respondents said they wanted to give Scout a nice, long belly rub; 98% described the border collie as “a good dog, a very good dog”; and 67% confirmed they wanted a big slobbery kiss from the pooch.

No respondents indicated they had established a strong rapport with the dog, though all expressed confidence they would soon be best friends with Scout.

While eyewitnesses said it briefly appeared that a Louisiana woman named Sonia Cattrall had gotten Scout to pursue her, it soon became clear the border collie had merely been chasing a squirrel and had not been engaging with any particular person.

At press time, tragedy struck as thousands were reportedly trampled to death, a stampede having ensued when all 340 million Americans frantically scrambled toward Scout to wave goodbye after the dog’s owner called him to her car.

"Pentagon Warns China Developing Love, The Greatest Weapon Of All",https://theonion.com/pentagon-warns-china-developing-love-the-greatest-weapon-of-all/,The Onion,,27-01-25,"ARLINGTON, VA—In a high-level alert that revealed a geo-political rival of the United States could soon become the first nation capable of wielding the most powerful force in the universe, the Pentagon warned Friday that China was actively developing love, the greatest weapon of all.

The alert, issued to the American public and top U.S. allies, stated that China had made significant advances in love, a transcendent source of strength that ultimately triumphs over any defenses an enemy might try to erect against it. Weapons experts confirmed that if it were unleashed, the all-consuming feeling could strike the hearts of billions throughout Asia and the Pacific, even reaching the West Coast of the United States.

“Our assessments indicate love is stronger than any technology possessed by the U.S. military,” said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, pledging to work with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other regional partners to stop China from harnessing the invincible cosmic force that always emerges victorious. “Intelligence estimates suggest the program is in its final stages, so we must act quickly or love will overwhelm us and we will feel compelled to surrender to it.”

“If China succeeds, it will have the power to remake the global order by spreading universal love and understanding to every corner of the world,” Austin added.

Nations have vied for years to develop love, knowing it would provide their arsenals with a weapon that could overcome anyone or anything it encountered. According to sources within the Pentagon who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Defense Department’s own 10-year, $750 billion effort has failed to produce an abundance of love, bringing it no closer than it was a decade ago to equipping the military with a profound sense of devotion to one’s fellow human beings.

China is believed to have put similar resources into its far more successful program, with surveillance reports indicating that by 2030 the nation will have obtained an emotion that can create a profound sense of oneness with the universe. Previously, U.S. military analysts had questioned whether China possessed the emotional vulnerability necessary to develop love, believing it was still several decades away from acquiring a feeling so expansive it knows no bounds and flows outward into every aspect of existence.

In 2019, the U.N. issued sanctions after it found evidence of China’s intent to open itself up to love’s embrace, but inspectors reportedly underestimated just how quickly the smallest seed of tenderness could flourish into a garden of eternal love. Today, international observers expressed concerns that if the weapon were used, the world would see a fallout of hundreds or even thousands of years in which love would endure all things.

“It is clearly a show of strength by China to love like its heart has never been broken,” said Daniel Feng, an expert on Sino-American relations at Georgetown University, noting that China’s ultimate goal was to assert its right as a sovereign nation to love freely and unselfishly by letting go of fears and expectations. “Quite frankly, no one can escape the power of love, and China knows it. By putting their hearts on the line, they are signaling that at any given moment they could shower the United States with a love so fierce it would leave their international rival unrecognizable afterward.”

“So what should the Pentagon do now?” he continued. “With new theories suggesting it has the potential to be far, far stronger than love, America’s best strategy may be developing the technology to harness the power of mild annoyance.”

Report: Best Pickup Technique Remains Approaching Woman And Saying ‘Ditch This Zero And Get With A Hero’,https://theonion.com/report-best-pickup-technique-remains-approaching-woman-and-saying-ditch-this-zero-and-get-with-a-hero/,The Onion,,23-01-25,"NEW YORK—Describing the time-tested method as a nearly guaranteed way of attracting a mate’s interest, a report released Thursday by Columbia University’s Department of Social Psychology found that the best pickup technique remained approaching a woman and saying “Ditch this zero and get with a hero.” “Our findings suggest this short phrase has an almost magnetic effect on women, who are often so impressed that they drop their partner immediately in order to start dating this apparently high-status suitor,” said Professor Henry Upton, who noted that stating “Hey babe, how about you ditch this zero and get with a hero?” was equally effective regardless of whether the woman was married, single, or simply out getting drinks with a friend. “Some women may be confused about who the ‘zero’ and ‘hero’ are that you’re referring to, which is why you should always point at yourself with both thumbs during the hero part. If she doesn’t get it right away, though, just move on to the next woman you see. It doesn’t matter if she’s just out walking her dog in the park, completely alone, or even standing at the altar with her betrothed. Eventually, one of these women will wake up to the fact that they’re with a total dud and could do way, way better.” Researchers added that if the woman responded affirmatively to the request, it was important to stare blankly back at her, shake one’s head in confusion, and then slowly walk home.

Surgeon General Recommends Adding Cancer Warning To All Nuclear Bombs,https://theonion.com/surgeon-general-recommends-adding-cancer-warning-to-all-nuclear-bombs/,The Onion,,23-01-25,"WASHINGTON—Pointing to the mounting scientific evidence showing the risks of using such explosive devices, outgoing U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory this week in which he recommended adding cancer warning labels to all nuclear bombs. “Nuclear bombs can cause cancer anywhere they are detonated, yet far too few Americans understand the dangers of standing in a nuclear blast zone for even a few minutes every day,” said Murthy, who described the warning labels as a necessary corrective to counter decades of misinformation from nuclear weapon makers. “Back in the ’50s and ’60s, detonating a thermonuclear device every once in a while was seen as a harmless way to blow off some steam with friends. These days, though, we know that’s not the case, particularly for those who are nursing or pregnant. These labels will ensure that Americans understand they are putting their health at stake when they set off a few fusion bombs during a night out.” Murthy added that California had already been applying such labels for decades and had seen a marked decline in nuclear bomb users.

Nutritionists Recommend Following Occasional Trail Of Sweets Into Dark Forest To Help Manage Cravings,https://theonion.com/nutritionists-recommend-following-occasional-trail-of-sweets-into-dark-forest-to-help-manage-cravings/,The Onion,,22-01-25,"NEW YORK—Saying the best healthy eating habits are the ones people can realistically stick to in the long term, a panel of New York University nutritionists issued recommendations Wednesday that included following the occasional trail of sweets into a dark forest to help manage cravings. “If your sweet tooth is making it difficult to stay on a diet plan that cuts out sugary treats entirely, there’s nothing wrong with being lured deep into a foreboding wood by a trail of otherworldly confections every now and then to keep those urges in check,” said nutritionist Lisa Alden, adding that people who let their cravings build up by denying them altogether are statistically more likely to undo their progress by binge-eating an entire gingerbread cottage. “You can set limits for yourself—like ‘I’m only going to follow this trail of sweets until the candy cane bridge’ or ‘I’m going to eat the caramels on the trail but leave the gumdrops so I can find my way back home’—to gain a greater sense of control over your appetite. Obviously, we’re not saying to gobble up every sticky bun you find nestled ominously in the branches of a sycamore tree, but in moderation, trails of sweets can absolutely be part of an overall healthy diet.” The nutritionists also noted that bog crones with high cholesterol levels are known to fatten up their victims two belt sizes before eating them.

As recently as the 1990s, Americans could reliably expect to not only get a motherfuckin’ ‘hell yeah’ from their homies, but also get a little skin up top.

This ancient mystery can be neatly explained by a few simple machines and the intense physical labor of tens of thousands of invading alien troops.” Going on to acknowledge the genuine achievements of ancient Egyptians, Egerton noted that these Bronze Age humans had succeeded in using gravity cannons and proton rays to build the Great Sphinx in a single afternoon.

They should remember to be polite too, because Mrs. Claus says her sister has been going through a hard time lately and could really use our support. Ho, ho, ho!” Santa went on to state that Christmas would come a little late this year, as his sister-in-law needed more time to make enough bags for all the children on Santa’s route, having completed only 20 so far.

Pete Hegseth Clarifies Women Allowed In Combat Roles But It’s A Huge Turnoff,https://theonion.com/pete-hegseth-clarifies-women-allowed-in-combat-roles-but-its-a-huge-turnoff/,The Onion,,12-12-24,"WASHINGTON—In an evident attempt to walk back previous inflammatory statements, prospective Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth clarified Thursday that although he now believes women should be allowed in combat roles, he still sees that as a huge turnoff. “While I want to state that I have nothing but respect for the female troops serving our country, it’s important to stress that thinking about that sort of thing is a real boner killer,” said Hegseth, adding that even a “total knockout, 10 out of 10″ would be marked down several points in his book if she were dressed up in a baggy, shapeless military uniform and given an assault rifle. “Personally, I believe there are several aspects of their biology that make women far better equipped to be sexy back on the homefront. It also really grosses me out thinking of them with, like, a butch buzz cut and muscles. It should be up to each individual servicewoman to decide whether she wants to be deployed to the front lines and turned into a total uggo. If not, there’s certainly a lot of room for them to look like absolute bombshells dressed as Army nurses.” Hegseth went on to suggest his mind might be changed if the military dress code were amended to require female soldiers to wear only a camouflage bra and panties on the battlefield.

It’s crinkly and has veins in it, so we know it’s not grass. Does grass even have leaves? Anyhow, we’re thinking oak or maple, but those are just shot-in-the-dark guesses, to be honest.” At press time, the department confirmed it had closed its investigation into the leaf after distracted officials confirmed there were some pretty cool rocks over there.
