What are the church’s rites for the death of a pope and the election of a new one?,https://apnews.com/article/papal-succession-plan-what-happens-798029dfb83f4c03b61de5d9cf6945ff,AP News,,21-04-25,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Thedeath of a popestarts acenturies-old ritualinvolving sacred oaths by the cardinals electing a successor, the piercing of ballots with a needle and thread after they’re counted, and then burning them to produce either the white or black smoke to signal if there’s a new leader for the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics. The election itself is shrouded in secrecy, with cardinals forbidden from communicating with the outside world what happened during thevoting in the conclavebehind the frescoed walls of the Sistine Chapel. While there were some leaps of artistic license, the process is in many ways as it was depicted in last year’s Oscar-winning film“Conclave.” St. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned. Here is what happens when a pope dies, a period known as the “sede vacante,” or the “vacant See.” After the pope has died, the camerlengo, or chamberlain, must certify the death and seal the papal apartment. He runs administrative and financial duties of the Holy Seeuntil a new pope takes over. The largely ceremonial job of camerlengo is currently held by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Irish-born American head of the Vatican’s laity office, who also announced the death on Monday morning. Nearly all prefects of Vatican offices lose their jobs when a pope dies, but a few stay on, including the foreign minister and the master of liturgical ceremonies, who plays a key role in assembling the conclave.  The dean of the College of Cardinals summons the cardinals for the funeral, presiding at the Mass before the conclave begins. That position is currently held by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the retired head of the Vatican’s office for bishops.  In November 2024, Francisreformed the ritesto be used for his funeral, simplifying them to emphasize his role as a mere bishop and allowing for burial outside the Vatican. Francis has chosen to be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica, where his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani, is located. The death of a pope begins a precise sequence of events that include the confirmation of death in the pontiff’s home, the transfer of the coffin to St. Peter’s Basilica for public viewing, a funeral Mass and burial. Interment must take place between the fourth and sixth day after his death. After the funeral, there are nine days of official mourning, known as the “novendiali.” During this period, the cardinals arrive in Rome. To give everyone time to assemble, the conclave must begin 15-20 days after the “sede vacante” is declared, although it can start sooner if the cardinals agree. Only cardinals under age 80 are eligible to vote. Current regulations notionally limit the number of electors to 120, but popes have often exceeded that ceiling. According to the most recently updated Vatican statistics, there were 135 cardinals under age 80 and eligible to vote. Cardinals over age 80 can be elected pope. Those over 80 can’t vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the “existential peripheries” to find those who suffer — an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election. Any baptized Roman Catholic male is eligible to be pope, but since 1378, only cardinals have been selected. Some current leading candidates: — Cardinal Pietro Parolin of Italy, 70, Francis’ secretary of state and a veteran Vatican diplomat. — Cardinal Marc Ouellet of Canada, 80, head of the Vatican’s bishops office from 2010 to 2023. — Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn of Austria, 80, a student of Pope Benedict XVI and thus ostensibly having appeal for conservatives. — Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines, 67, brought by Francis to head the Vatican’s massive missionary office. — Cardinal Matteo Zuppi of Italy, 69, a Francis protégé who headed the Italian bishops conference. A first ballot is held in the Sistine Chapel on the afternoon after the initial Mass. If no pope is elected, over the ensuing days two ballots are held each morning and two each afternoon. The ballots are rectangular pieces of paper with the words: “Eligo in Summum Pontificem” (“I elect as supreme pontiff”) written on top, with a space for a name. Each cardinal makes his choice, folds the paper in half, walks to the front of the chapel and declares: “I call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected.” He then puts the ballot on a tray and tips it into a receptacle. Three designated cardinals, known as scrutineers, check each ballot to see if it is filled out correctly. Each name is read aloud and counted, with the results announced to the conclave after each round. If no one gets the needed two-thirds of votes, the ballots are pierced with a needle and thread, which is then knotted and placed on a tray, and another round of voting is prepared. Benedict modified some of John Paul’s 1996 conclave rules, most notably excluding his vision that a pope could be elected by a simple majority if voting was stalemated. Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority. Benedict also tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication. In John Paul’s rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe “absolute and perpetual secrecy” and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices. They now declare: “I take this oath fully aware that an infraction thereof will incur the penalty of automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See. So help me God and these Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hand.” Cardinals also are bound by secrecy, although the threat of excommunication only hangs over them explicitly if they are found to have accepted payment for their vote, allowed secular powers to influence it or entered into pacts with other cardinals to back a candidate. After the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted. Chemical cartridges are added to ensure there is no confusion over the color. To produce black smoke, a cartridge containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene — the component of coal tar — and sulfur is burned with the ballots. For white smoke, a cartridge of potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin is burned with the ballots. Bells also are rung to signal the election of a pope, for further clarity. The new pope is introduced from the loggia overlooking St. Peter’s Square with the words, “Habemus Papam!” (“We have a pope!”) and his chosen papal name. The new pope then emerges and gives his first blessing.",World News,1
"Pope Francis, first Latin American pontiff who ministered with a charming, humble style, dies at 88",https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-francis-dead-01ca7d73c3c48d25fd1504ba076e2e2a,AP News,Nicole Winfield,21-04-25,"▶ Follow live updates on thedeath of Pope Francis. VATICAN CITY (AP) — Pope Francis, history’s first Latin American pontiff who charmed the world with his humble style andconcern for the poorbut alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change,died Monday. He was 88. The Vatican said Francis died of a stroke that put him into a coma and led to heart failure. Bells tolled in Catholic churches from his native Argentina to the Philippines and across Rome as news spread around the world. “At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,” Cardinal Kevin Farrellsaid from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta, where Francis lived. Francis, who suffered from chronic lung disease and had part of one lung removed as a young man, wasadmitted to Gemelli hospitalon Feb. 14, 2025, for a respiratory crisis that developed into double pneumonia. He spent 38 days there, the longest hospitalization of his12-year papacy. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports the Vatican has announced that Pope Francis has died, Monday, at 88. He made his last public appearanceon Easter Sunday— a day before his death — to bless thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square, drawing wild cheers and applause. Beforehand, he met U.S. Vice President JD Vance. Francisperformed the blessing from the same loggia where he was introduced on March 13, 2013, as the 266th pope. From hisfirst greetingthat night — a remarkably normal “Buonasera” (“Good evening”) — to his embrace of refugees and the downtrodden, Francis signaled avery different tonefor the papacy, stressing humility over hubris for a Catholic Church beset by scandal and accusations of indifference.  The Argentine-born Jorge Mario Bergoglio brought abreath of fresh air into a 2,000-year-old institutionthat had seen its influence wane during the troubled tenure of Pope Benedict XVI, whose surprise resignation led to Francis’ election. But Francis sooninvited troubles of his own, and conservatives grew increasingly upset with his progressive bent, outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics and crackdown on traditionalists. His greatest test came in 2018 when he botched anotorious case of clergy sexual abuse in Chile, and the scandal that festered under his predecessors erupted anew. And then Francis, the crowd-loving, globe-trotting pope of the peripheries, navigated the unprecedented reality of leading a universal religion through the coronavirus pandemic from a locked-down Vatican City. “We have realized that we are on the same boat, all of us fragile and disoriented,” Francis told an empty St. Peter’s Square in March 2020. Calling for a rethink of the global economic framework, he said the pandemic showed the need for “all of us to row together, each of us in need of comforting the other.” World leaders on Mondayextolled Francis’ commitmentto the marginalized. French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is largely Catholic, wrote on X: “From Buenos Aires to Rome, Pope Francis wanted the church to bring joy and hope to the poorest. ... May this hope forever outlast him.” Flags flew at half-staff in Italy, and crowds gathered in St. Peter’s Square. When the great bells of St. Peter’s Basilica began tolling, tourists stopped in their tracks to record the moment on their phones. Johann Xavier, who traveled from Australia, hoped to see the pope during his visit. “But then we heard about it when we came in here. It pretty much devastated all of us,’’ he said. Francis’ death sets off aweekslong processof allowing the faithful to pay their final respects, first for Vatican officials in the Santa Marta chapel and then in St. Peter’s for the general public, followed by afuneral and a conclaveto elect a new pope. As the sun was setting on Monday evening, the Vatican held a Rosary prayer in St. Peter’s Square in its first public commemoration. In his final will, Francis confirmed he will be buried in St. Mary Major Basilica in a simple underground tomb with only “Franciscus” written on it. The basilica, which sits outside the Vatican, is home to Francis’ favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom Francis was particularly devoted.

(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino)  Francis was elected on a mandate to reform the Vatican bureaucracy and finances but went further in shaking up the church without changing its core doctrine. “Who am I to judge?” hereplied when askedabout a purportedly gay priest. The comment sent a message of welcome to the LGBTQ+ community and those who felt shunned by a church that had stressed sexual propriety over unconditional love. “Being homosexual is not a crime,” hetold The Associated Pressin 2023, urging an end to civil laws that criminalize it. Stressing mercy, Francis changed the church’s position on the death penalty, calling it inadmissible in all circumstances. He also declared the possession of nuclear weapons, not just their use, was “immoral.” In other firsts, he approved an agreement with China over bishop nominations that had vexed the Vatican for decades, met the Russian patriarch and charted new relations with the Muslim world by visiting the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq. He reaffirmed the all-male, celibate priesthood and upheld the church’s opposition to abortion, equating it to “hiring a hit man to solve a problem.” But he added women to important decision-making roles and allowed them to serve as lectors and acolytes in parishes. He let women vote alongside bishops in periodic Vatican meetings, following long-standing complaints that women do much of the church’s work but are barred from power. Sister Nathalie Becquart, whom Francis named to one of the highest Vatican jobs, said his legacy was a vision of a church where men and women existed in a relationship of reciprocity and respect. “It was about shifting a pattern of domination — from human being to the creation, from men to women — to a pattern of cooperation,” said Becquart, the first woman to hold a voting position in a Vatican synod. Still, a note of criticism came Monday from the Women’s Ordination Conference, which had been frustrated by Francis’ unwillingness to push for the ordination of women. “His repeated ‘closed door’ policy on women’s ordination was painfully incongruous with his otherwise pastoral nature, and for many, a betrayal of the synodal, listening church he championed. This made him a complicated, frustrating, and sometimes heart-breaking figure for many women,” the statement said.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia)  While Francis did not allow women to be ordained, the voting reform was part of a revolutionary change in emphasizing what the church should be: arefuge for everyone— “todos, todos, todos” (“everyone, everyone, everyone”). Migrants, the poor, prisoners and outcasts were invited to his table far more than presidents or powerful CEOs. “For Pope Francis, (the goal) was always to extend the arms of the church to embrace all people, not to exclude anyone,” said Farrell, the Vatican camerlengo, who takes charge after a pontiff’s death. Francis demanded his bishops apply mercy and charity to their flocks, pressed the world to protect God’s creation from climate disaster, and challenged countries to welcome those fleeing war, poverty and oppression.  After visiting Mexico in 2016, Francis said of then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump that anyone building a wall to keep migrants out “is not Christian.” While progressives were thrilled with Francis’ radical focus on Jesus’ message of mercy and inclusion, it troubled conservatives who feared he watered down Catholic teaching and threatened the very Christian identity of the West. Some even called him a heretic. A few cardinals openly challenged him. Francis usually responded with his typical answer to conflict: silence. He made it easier for married Catholics to get an annulment, allowed priests to absolve women who had had abortions and decreed that priests could bless same-sex couples. He opened debate on issues like homosexuality and divorce, giving pastors wiggle room to discern how to accompany their flocks, rather than handing them strict rules to apply.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini, file)  Francis lived in the Vatican hotel instead of the Apostolic Palace, wore his old orthotic shoes and not the red loafers of the papacy, and rode in compact cars. It wasn’t a gimmick. “I see clearly that the thing the church needs most today is the ability to heal wounds and to warm the hearts of the faithful,” he told a Jesuit journal in 2013. “I see the church as a field hospital after battle.” If becoming the first Latin American and first Jesuit pope wasn’t enough, Francis was also the first to name himself afterSt. Francis of Assisi, the 13th century friar known for personal simplicity and care for society’s outcasts. Francis formally apologized to Indigenous peoples for the crimes of the church from colonial times onward. And he went to society’s fringes to minister with mercy: caressing the deformed head of a man in St. Peter’s Square, kissing the tattoo of a Holocaust survivor, or inviting Argentina’s garbage scavengers to join him onstage in Rio de Janeiro. “We have always been marginalized, but Pope Francis always helped us,” said Coqui Vargas, a transgender woman whose Roman community forged a unique relationship with Francis. His first trip as pope was to the Italian island of Lampedusa, then the epicenter of Europe’s migration crisis. He consistently chose to visit poor countries where Christians were often persecuted minorities, rather than the centers of global Catholicism.

(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino, File)  Friend and fellow Argentine, Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, said his concern was based on the Beatitudes — the eight blessings Jesus delivered in the Sermon on the Mount for the meek, the merciful, the poor in spirit and others. “Why are the Beatitudes the program of this pontificate? Because they were the basis of Jesus Christ’s own program,” Sánchez said.

Caivano)  But more than a year passed before Francis met with survivors of priestly sexual abuse, and victims’ groups initially questioned whether he really understood the scope of the problem. Francis did create a sex abuse commission to advise the church on best practices, but it lost influence after a few years and its recommendation of a tribunal to judge bishops who covered up for predator priests went nowhere. And then came the greatest crisis of his papacy, when he discredited Chilean abuse victims in 2018 and stood by a controversial bishop linked to their abuser. Realizing his error, Francis invited the victims to the Vatican for a personal mea culpa and summoned the leadership of the Chilean church to resign en masse. As that crisis concluded, a new one erupted over ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the retired archbishop of Washington and a counselor to three popes. Francis had actually moved swiftly to sideline McCarrick amid an accusation he had molested a teenage altar boy in the 1970s. But Francis nevertheless was accused by the Vatican’s one-time U.S. ambassador of having rehabilitated McCarrick early in his papacy. Francis eventually defrocked McCarrick after a Vatican investigation determined he sexually abused adults as well as minors. He changed church law to remove the pontifical secret surrounding abuse cases and enacted procedures to investigate bishops who abused or covered for their pedophile priests, seeking to end impunity for the hierarchy. “He sincerely wanted to do something and he transmitted that,” said Juan Carlos Cruz, a Chilean abuse survivor Francis discredited who later developed a close friendship with the pontiff. But groups that advocated for more action on sexual abuse expressed disappointment in Francis’ legacy. “Pope Francis was a beacon of hope to many of the world’s most desperate and marginalized people. But what we most needed from this pope was justice for the Church’s own wounded, the children and adults sexually abused by Catholic clergy. In this realm, where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes,” said Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the U.S.-based group BishopAccountability.

(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino, File)  The road to Francis’ 2013 election was paved by Pope Benedict XVI’s decision to resign and retire — the first in 600 years. Francis didn’t shy from Benedict’s potentially uncomfortable shadow. Francisembraced himas an elder statesman and adviser, coaxing him out of his cloistered retirement to participate in the public life of the church untilBenedict’s deathin 2022. “It’s like having your grandfather in the house, a wise grandfather,” Francis said. Francis’ looser liturgical style and pastoral priorities made clear he and the German-born theologian came from very different religious traditions, and Francis directly overturned several decisions of his predecessor. He made sure Salvadoran Archbishop Óscar Romero, a hero to the liberation theology movement in Latin America, was canonized after his case languished under Benedict over concerns about the credo’s Marxist bent. Francis reimposed restrictions on celebrating the old Latin Mass that Benedict had relaxed, arguing it was divisive. The move riled Francis’ traditionalist critics and opened sustained conflict with right-wing Catholics, particularly in the U.S. Pope Francis presides the Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) torchlight procession celebrated in front of the Colosseum on Good Friday in Rome, March 29, 2013. (AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)  By then, conservatives had alreadyturned away fromFrancis, betrayed after he opened debate on allowing remarried Catholics to receive the sacraments if they didn’t get an annulment — a church ruling that their first marriage was invalid. “We don’t like this pope,” headlined Italy’s conservative daily Il Foglio a few months into the papacy, reflecting the unease of the small but vocal traditionalist Catholic movement. Those same critics amplified their complaints after Francis approved church blessings for same-sex couples, and a controversial accord with China over nominating bishops. Its details were never released, but conservative critics bashed it as a sellout to communist China, while the Vatican defended it as the best deal it could get. U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, a figurehead in the anti-Francis opposition, said the church had become “like a ship without a rudder.” Burke waged his opposition campaign for years, starting when Francis fired him as the Vatican’s supreme court justice and culminating with his vocal opposition to Francis’ 2023 synod on the church’s future.  Francis eventually sanctioned Burke financially, accusing him of sowing “disunity.” Francis insisted his bishops and cardinals imbue themselves with the “odor of their flock” and minister to the faithful, voicing displeasure when they didn’t. His 2014 Christmas address to the Vatican Curia was one of the greatest public papal reprimands ever: Standing in the marbled Apostolic Palace, Francis ticked off 15 ailments he said can afflict his closest collaborators, including “spiritual Alzheimer’s,” lusting for power and the “terrorism of gossip.” Trying to eliminate corruption, Francis oversaw the reform of the scandal-marred Vatican bank and sought to wrestle Vatican bureaucrats into financial line, limiting their compensation and ability to receive gifts or award public contracts. He authorized Vatican police to raid his own secretariat of state and the Vatican’s financial watchdog agency amid suspicions about a 350 million euro investment in a London real estate venture. After a 2 1/2-year trial, the Vatican tribunal convicted a once-powerful cardinal, Angelo Becciu, of embezzlement and returned mixed verdicts to nine others, acquitting one. The trial, though, proved to be a reputational boomerang for the Holy See, showing deficiencies in the Vatican’s legal system, unseemly turf battles among monsignors, and how the pope had intervened on behalf of prosecutors. While earning praise for trying to turn the Vatican’s finances around, Francis angered U.S. conservatives for his frequent excoriation of the global financial market. Economic justice was an important theme of his papacy, and he didn’t hide it in his first meeting with journalists when he said he wanted a “poor church that is for the poor.” In his first major teaching document, “The Joy of the Gospel,” Francis denounced trickle-down economic theories as unproven and naive. “Money must serve, not rule!” he said in urging political reforms. Some U.S. conservatives branded Francis a Marxist. He jabbed back by saying he had many friends who were Marxists.

(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini)  Born Dec. 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was the eldest of five children of Italian immigrants. He credited his devout grandmother Rosa with teaching him how to pray. Weekends were spent listening to opera on the radio, going to Mass and attending matches of the family’s beloved San Lorenzo soccer club. As pope,his love of soccerbrought him a huge collection of jerseys from visitors. He said he received his religious calling at 17 while going to confession, recounting in a 2010 biography that, “I don’t know what it was, but it changed my life. ... I realized that they were waiting for me.” He entered the diocesan seminary but switched to the Jesuit order in 1958, attracted to its missionary tradition and militancy. Around this time, he suffered from pneumonia, which led to the removal of part of his right lung. His frail health prevented him from becoming a missionary, and his less-than-robust lung capacity was perhaps responsible for his whisper of a voice and reluctance to sing at Mass. On Dec. 13, 1969, he was ordained a priest, and immediately began teaching. In 1973, he was named head of the Jesuits in Argentina, an appointment he later acknowledged was “crazy” given he was only 36. “My authoritarian and quick manner of making decisions led me to have serious problems and to be accused of being ultraconservative,” he admitted in his Civilta Cattolica interview. In this Aug. 7, 2009 file photo, Argentina’s Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio gives a Mass outside the San Cayetano church where an Argentine flag hangs behind in Buenos Aires, Argentina. (AP Photo/Natacha Pisarenko)  His six-year tenure as the head of the order in Argentina coincided with the country’s murderous 1976-83 dictatorship, when the military launched a campaign against left-wing guerrillas and other regime opponents. Bergoglio didn’t publicly confront the junta and was accused of effectively allowing two slum priests to be kidnapped and tortured by not publicly endorsing their work. He refused for decades to counter that version of events. Only in a 2010 authorized biography did he finally recount the lengths he used to save them, persuading the family priest of feared dictator Jorge Videla to call in sick so he could celebrate Mass instead. Once in the junta leader’s home, Bergoglio privately appealed for mercy. Both priests were eventually released, among the few to have survived prison. As pope, accounts began to emerge of the many people — priests, seminarians and political dissidents —whom Bergoglio actually saved during the “dirty war,” letting them stay incognito at the seminary or helping them escape the country. Bergoglio went to Germany in 1986 to research a never-finished thesis. Returning to Argentina, he was stationed in Cordoba during a period he described as a time of “great interior crisis.” Out of favor with more progressive Jesuit leaders, he was eventually rescued from obscurity in 1992 by St. John Paul II, who named him an auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. He became archbishop six years later, and was made a cardinal in 2001. He came close to becoming pope in 2005 when Benedict was elected, gaining the second-most votes in several rounds before bowing out.

Global tributes pour in to honor Pope Francis after his death,https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-reaction-78ef38471b2560d74a1e25cbd31cbc7e,AP News,Jamey Keaten,21-04-25,"LYON, France (AP) — Church bells tolled in mourning. Well-wishers flocked into pews. Tributes toPope Francispoured in from around the world on Monday after theVatican announced the pontiff’s deathat age 88. The 266th pope was praised for his groundbreaking steps to honor the poor and the vulnerable; seek to end conflicts like those in the Middle East, Ukraine and Africa; protect the environment; and guide the Catholic Church toward greater tolerance of gays and lesbians, among other things. Some critics say he didn’t always go far enough. Others said he went too far.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)  Many recalled his legacy as the first pope from Latin America, and the first Jesuit to reach the pinnacle of church hierarchy, one who stressed humility over hubris for a Church beset with scandal and indifference — and even as a soccer fan from “futbol”-crazed Argentina. Here’s a look at some of the global reactions a day after hislast public appearance on Easter Sundayto bless thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square. — U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who met with the pope on Easter Sunday beforetraveling to India, wrote on social media that his “heart goes out” to the millions of Christians who loved him, and said: “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill.” — President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!”  — King Charles III praised the pope for his work on safeguarding the planet, and alluded to their multiple personal meetings — including a private visit on April 10 at the Vatican. “We were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month,’’ the King wrote in a statement signed “Charles R.” It was the pope’s first known meeting with a foreign dignitary after he was hospitalized for five weeks with double pneumonia.

(AP Photo/Slamet Riyadi)  The church was one of many in the Philippines, the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia, to ring its bells to mourn the death of the pontiff, who in 2015 consoled survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and celebrated Mass before millions in Manila. “Pope Francis showed us what it means to suffer with others and find hope in the midst of pain,” said Manila Archbishop Jose Advincula, alluding to the devastation wreaked by Haiyan in 2013 that left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and displaced more than 5 million. — Martin Pendergast, secretary of the LGBT Catholics Westminster in London, recalled how Francis looked past sexual orientation and said he wouldn’t judge people who tried to carry out the will of God. “He was the first pope to actually use the word ‘gay,’ so even the way he speaks has been a radical transformation — and some would say a bit of a revolution as well -- compared with some of his predecessors,” Pendergast said. — The Women’s Ordination Conference lamented Francis’ unwillingness to push for the ordination of women. “His repeated ‘closed door’ policy on women’s ordination was painfully incongruous with his otherwise pastoral nature, and for many, a betrayal of the synodal, listening church he championed,” the conference said. “This made him a complicated, frustrating and sometimes heart-breaking figure for many women.” — Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of U.S.-based group BishopAccountability, called Francis “a beacon of hope” to many desperate and marginalized people worldwide. “But what we most needed from this pope was justice for the Church’s own wounded, the children and adults sexually abused by Catholic clergy. In this realm, where Francis had supreme power, he refused to make the necessary changes. This choice is having devastating consequences for the Church’s most powerless members. It will forever tarnish the legacy of this remarkable man.” Genali Nogales kisses a painting of the late Pope Francis at the Basílica de San José de Flores, where he worshipped as a youth, following the Vatican’s announcement of his death in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Monday, April 21, 2025.

Broglio, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, noted a recent letter from the pope to bishops in the United States alluding to “our attempts to respond to the face of Christ in the migrant, poor, and unborn. In fact, he has always used the strongest and clearest expressions in the defense of the dignity of the human person from conception to natural death.” Francisupheld church teaching opposing abortionand echoed his predecessors in saying that human life is sacred and must be defended. But he didn’t emphasize the church’s position as much as they did, and said women who had abortions must be accompanied spiritually by the church. — French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking in the cyclone-battered Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, France’s poorest territory, said Pope Francis ″was at the sides of the most vulnerable, the most fragile, with a lot of humility, and in these times of war and instability, with a particular sense of the other, of the most fragile.″ Devotees pray during a mass for the late Pope Francis at the Cubao Cathedral in Quezon city, Philippines Monday, April 21, 2025. (AP Photo/Aaron Favila)  ″Throughout his whole life he fought for more justice, throughout his whole life he fought for a certain idea of humanity, an idea of fraternal humanity.″ — Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, one of the few official visitors to see Francis during his recent hospitalization, alluded to the pope’s personal comfort and advice, saying it “never failed me, not even in times of trial and suffering.” She added: “We are saying goodbye to a great man and a great shepherd.” Flags were flown at half-staff on Monday across Italy and some top-levelsoccer matches were postponed. — Argentine President Javier Milei, who had chilly relations with the pope, expressed sorrow. “Despite differences that seem minor today, having been able to know him in his kindness and wisdom was a true honor for me,” the far-right president wrote on X. As a TV pundit and libertarian economist before assuming office in 2023, Milei had publicly insulted Pope Francis as “representative of the evil one on Earth” for his perceived sympathy toward left-wing leaders and causes. — The pope’s beloved soccer team — Buenos Aires club San Lorenzo, whose nickname is “The Saints” — wrote “Goodbye, Holy Father” and “Our soul hurts” on its website. The team won the national championship in 2013, the year he was elected pope. During a global conference on faith and sport in 2016, Francis implored leaders to do a better job of keeping corruption off the playing field and said sports must be protected from manipulations and commercial abuse. — Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te expressed condolences on social media and said people there would “continue to draw inspiration from his lifelong commitment to peace, global solidarity, and caring for those in need.” The Holy See is among Taiwan’s only 12 remaining diplomatic allies while China, which claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, has been poaching others. — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa noted the pope’s “extraordinary life story” and said “Pope Francis advanced a world view of inclusion, equality and care for marginalized individuals and groups, as well as responsible and sustainable custody of the natural environment.” Africa has seen some of the Catholic Church’s biggest growth in recent years. — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recalled the pontiff asan inspiration for the entire world, not just Christians. “He inspired millions, far beyond the Catholic Church, with his humility and love so pure for the less fortunate,” she said on social media. “My thoughts are with all who feel this profound loss.” — Israeli President Issac Herzog, whose role is mostly ceremonial, called Francis a man of “deep faith and boundless compassion.” Francis repeatedly criticized Israel’s wartime conduct in Gaza and saidallegations of genocide, which Israel has adamantly denied, should be investigated. “I truly hope that his prayers for peace in the Middle East and for the safe return of the hostages will soon be answered,” Herzog said on social media.

(AP Photo/Aaron Favila)  — The Palestine Red Crescent offered condolences to Christians, calling the pope “one of the most prominent supporters of justice and human dignity, including his noble stances regarding the suffering of the Palestinian people and their right to freedom and justice.” — In Gaza, Suheil Abu Dawoud, a 19-year-old Christian, recalled how Francis opposed the war in Gaza, called for peace between Palestinians and Israelis and had “asked us to be strong.” The pope used his final Easter Sunday message to lament growing antisemitism, call for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, appeal to the fighting sides to reach a ceasefire, and “come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!” — President Alexander Van der Bellen of Austria recalled how the pope traveled to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a key landing point for migrants seeking to reach Europe, to meet with refugees and commemorate those who died while trying to cross the Mediterranean. The Austrian leader said on social media that the pope’s impact resonated in ways large and small: “He ensured that homeless people near St. Peter’s Square could shower. He criticized dehumanizing words and gestures. That was Pope Francis.” — President Vladimir Putin of Russia hailed the pope as a “consistent defender of the high values of humanism and justice.” Last year, Francissuggested Ukraineshould try to negotiate an end to thewar with Russia. Critics said those comments suggested the pope was siding with Russia. Francis tried to maintain the Vatican’s traditional diplomatic neutrality, but that was often accompanied by apparent sympathy with Russia’s rationale for invading Ukraine — as when he said NATO was “barking at Russia’s door” with its eastward expansion. — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X that his war-torn country grieved together with Catholics and all Christians who looked to Pope Francis for spiritual support: “He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity. He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians. Eternal memory!” — Dutch King Willem-Alexander and his wife Queen Máxima, who like the pope was born in Argentina, recalled their “personal audience” with the pope at the Holy See in 2017 and how “Pope Francis radiated mercy in everything he did. With his deep-rooted faith in God’s love, he was the embodiment of benevolence and humanity.” They called him a “committed guardian of the listening and loving Church, and as a result he succeeded in winning the hearts of many, both within the Roman Catholic Church and outside it.” — The Dalai Lama honored the pope in a letter to the Most Rev. Leopoldo Girelli, the Apostolic Nuncio to India, saying Francis “dedicated himself to the service of others, consistently revealing by his own actions how to live a simple, but meaningful life.” “The best tribute we can pay to him is to be a warm-hearted person, serving others wherever and in whatever way we can,” the Tibetan spiritual leader wrote. — Former U.S. President Joe Biden, who regularly attends Mass, on X called Francis “the People’s Pope” and wrote: “I am better for having known him.” ___ AP journalists from around the world contributed to this report.",World News,1
White House voices support for Hegseth as a new Signal chat revelation stirs fresh Pentagon turmoil,https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-pentagon-trump-30dc4c3d0e75a89f3fd883f38b26afff,AP News,Tara Copp,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House expressed support Monday forDefense Secretary Pete Hegsethfollowing media reports that he shared sensitive military details inanother Signal messaging chat, this time with his wife and brother. Neither the White House nor Hegseth denied that he had shared such information in a second chat, instead focusing their responses on what they called the disgruntled workers whom theyblamed for leaking to the mediaand insisting that noclassified informationhad been disclosed. “It’s just fake news. They just bring up stories,” President Donald Trump told reporters. “I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. You know, he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people, and that’s what he’s doing. So you don’t always have friends when you do that,” Trump said. The administration’s posture was meant to hold the line against Democratic demands for Hegseth’s firing at a time when the Pentagon is engulfed in turmoil, including thedepartures of several senior aidesandan internal investigationover information leaks. The White House also tried to deflect attention from the national security implications of the latest Signal revelation by framing it as the outgrowth of an institutional power struggle between Hegseth and the career workforce. But some of therecently departed officialsthe administration appeared to dismiss as disgruntled were part of Hegseth’s initial inner circle, brought in when he took the job. “This is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in remarks amplified by a Pentagon social media account.  The latest news added to questions about the judgment of the embattled Pentagon chief, coming on top of last month’s disclosure of his participation in aSignal chat with top Trump administration leadersin which details about the military airstrike against Yemen’s Houthi militants were shared. “Pete Hegseth must be fired,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. The New York Times reported Sunday that the information shared in a Signal messaging chat with Hegseth’s wife, brother and others was similar to what was communicated in the already disclosed chain with Trump administration officials. A person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, confirmed the second chat to The Associated Press. The person said it included 13 people and was dubbed “Defense ' Team Huddle.” White House officials first learned of the second Signal chat from news reports Sunday, according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Hegseth, talking to reporters while attending theWhite House Easter Egg Roll, didn’t address the substance of the allegations or the national security implications they raised but assailed the media. “They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations,” Hegseth said. “Not going to work with me. Because we’re changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters. And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn’t matter.” Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, struck a similar tone,writing on Sunday night on X: “Secretary Hegseth is busy implementing President Trump’s America First agenda, while these leakers are trying to undermine them both. Shameful.” The Trump administration has struggled in its public explanations about senior officials’ use of Signal, acommercially available appnot authorized to be used to communicate sensitive or classified national defense information. The first chat, set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, included a number of Cabinet members andcame to light because Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the group. Officials have repeatedly insisted that the information shared on Signal was not classified, though the contents of that chat, which The Atlantic published, shows that Hegseth listed weapons systems and a timeline for theattack on the Iran-backed Houthislast month. Multiple current and former military officials say launch times and munitions drop times are classified information and putting those details on an unsecured channel could have put those pilots at risk. The Trump administration has faced criticism forfailing to take actionso far against top national security officials who discussed plans for the strike in Signal, and the latest report fueled additional calls for Hegseth’s ouster. “The details keep coming out. We keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk. But Trump is still too weak to fire him,” Schumerposted Sunday on X. The New York Times reported that the group in the second chat included Hegseth’s wife, Jennifer, who is a former Fox News producer, and his brotherPhil Hegseth, who was hired at the Pentagonas a Department of Homeland Security liaison and senior adviser. The Times said the second chat had the same warplane launch times that the first chat included. Hegseth’s Signal use is underinvestigation by the Defense Department’s acting inspector generalat the request of the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The senior Democratic member, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, urged the watchdog Sunday to look into the reported second chat as well. The Pentagon has confronted a wave of turbulence stretching beyond Signal. Defense officials have faced scrutiny over a seemingly haphazard and disjointedcampaign to purge online contentthat promoted women and minorities, in some casesscrambling to restore postsafter their removals came to light. Over the past week, five officials in Hegseth’s inner circle have departed. Dan Caldwell, a Hegseth aide; Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg; and Darin Selnick, Hegseth’s deputy chief of staff;were escorted out of the Pentagonas the department hunts down leaks of inside information. While those three initially had been placed on leave pending the investigation, ajoint statement shared by Caldwellon X on Saturday said they “still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with.” Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot announced he was resigning last week, unrelated to the leaks. The Pentagon said, however, that Ullyot was asked to resign. A fifth close Hegseth aide, chief of staff Joe Kasper, also was leaving, according to two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They didn’t say why. Caldwell and Selnick had worked with the defense secretary during his time leading the nonprofit Concerned Veterans for America. Kasper was the one who sent a March memo saying the Pentagon was investigating what it calledleaks of national security informationand that Defense Department personnel could face polygraphs. ___ Associated Press writers Chris Megerian and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",World News,1
Gaza rescue service dismisses Israeli probe into killing of medics as a ‘fabricated investigation’,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-ceasefire-hostages-04-21-2025-17ffc7981c4fe1f87b25b54b3c17bf20,AP News,,21-04-25,"CAIRO (AP) — The main Palestinian rescue service in Gaza on Monday condemned Israel’s probe into the killings of 15 medical workers last month, calling it a “fabricated investigation.” The army announced the results ofits investigationon Sunday, saying it had found “professional failures” and dismissing a deputy commander in what it described as an accident. A total of 15 people were killed in the March 23 incident — including eight medics with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, six members of the Hamas government’s Civil Defense unit and a United Nations staffer. Troops bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. U.N. and rescue workers were only able to reach the site a week later. In a statement, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said the investigation underscores “the occupation’s persistence in shielding the truth from the world.” It accused Israel of making “fallacious allegations” that medical rescue teams are part of Hamas and asked why Israel continues to detain a paramedic who survived the attack. “We call on the international community to abstain from validating the results of the occupation’s fabricated investigation,” it said. Israel at first claimed the medics’ vehicles were acting suspiciously and did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire. But the armylater backtrackedafter cellphone video recovered from one medic showed the ambulances had lights flashing and logos visible as they pulled up to help another ambulance that earlier came under fire. The military said six of those killed were Hamas militants, but has given little evidenced to support the claim. The shootings outraged many in the international community, with some calling the killings a war crime.",World News,1
Conservative Poilievre seemed poised to be Canada’s next leader. Then Trump declared economic war,https://apnews.com/article/canada-election-conservative-leader-poilievre-eb8b21c931ff991f7158aff5ea4638a3,AP News,Rob Gillies,21-04-25,"TORONTO (AP) — Until a few months ago, Pierre Poilievre was seen as a shoo-in to become Canada’s next prime minister and shepherd his Conservative Party back into power for the first time in a decade. Then, President Donald Trump declared economic war on the U.S.'s neighbor to the north and even threatened to make Canada the 51st state. Poilievre, acareer politician and firebrand populist, has campaigned with Trump-like braggadocio, even taking a page from the “America First” president by adopting the slogan “Canada First.” But his similarities to Trump might cost him the chance to become prime minister when Canadians head to the polls on April 28. Trump’s frequent attacks on Canada’s economy and sovereignty have infuriated Canadians and led to asurge in nationalismthat has bolstered Liberal Party poll numbers. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre speaks during a news conference in Ottawa, March 14, 2025. (Chris Tanouye/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  Like Trump, Poilievre brags about the size of the crowd at his campaign rallies and attacks the mainstream media, recently calling a female journalist a protester. In response to the changes in public opinion, some Poilievre supporters wore hoodies to a recent rally with the slogan, “Do you believe the polls?” The change in the polls has been dramatic. In a mid-January poll by Nanos, the Liberals trailed the Conservatives by 47% to 20%. In the latest Nanos poll, which was conducted during a three-day period that ended April 20, the Liberals led by eight percentage points. The January poll had a margin of error of 3.1 points while the latest poll had a 2.7-point margin.

(Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  “The Trumpy hectoring of people, the slogans, the big rallies — like it all just seems like so Trump. And people are not loving Trump right now in Canada,” said Kory Teneycke, a key figure in conservative Canadian politics who directs campaigns.  “(Poilievre’s) style and his approach to politics certainly channel a lot of Trump. It’s like a cheap karaoke version of Trump.” Poilievre is imploring Canadians not to give the Liberals a fourth term after “a lost Liberal decade.” He hoped to make the election a referendum on formerPrime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned andMark Carney, a two-time central banker, became Liberal party leader and prime minister. After decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.  Poilievre is best known for his populist slogans and attacks on Trudeau, whom he blamed for high inflation. He was a Cabinet minister in former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s government and has led the opposition Conservatives since 2022. Teneycke said Poilievre’s skill as a “political attack dog” is what led him to great heights. “When that ire was focused on a very unpopular prime minister in Justin Trudeau, that was working for him,” Teneycke said. “Exit Trudeau, enter Trump and it’s a totally changed game. He hasn’t brought that level of ferocity to Trump.” Canada Federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre appears at a federal election campaign event in Brampton, Ontario, March 24, 2025. (Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Poilievre is different from Trump in quite a few ways but, stylistically, their rhetoric is often similar. “Sounding like someone many of your fellow citizens perceive as their country’s public enemy No. 1 can’t be a good thing in politics,” Béland said. A married 45-year-old father of two, Poilievre represents a district outside the capital, Ottawa, but he grew up in Alberta, Canada’s most conservative province. He has been a member of Parliament since the age of 25. Poilievre volunteered on conservative campaigns during his teenage years, joined the campus conservative club at the University of Calgary and was a finalist for an essay-writing contest about what he would do if he were prime minister.

And although he said Poilievre’s views are more aligned than Carney’s with his own, he’s not a fan of Poilievre. “The conservative that’s running is stupidly no friend of mine,” Trump has said, criticizing Poilievre for “saying negative things.” Poilievre, like Carney, said that if he’s elected, he would accelerate renegotiations of the free trade deal with the U.S. He also wants Trump to suspend U.S. tariffs during the talks. He said Trump should “knock off” his attacks on Canada, but that “nobody can control this president.” Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre arrives in Terrace, British Columbia, during a campaign stop on April 6, 2025. (Aaron Whitfield/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a conservative ally of Poilievre, said Poilievre would be “very much in sync” with the “new direction in America.” Poilievre has vowed to defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the public broadcaster and a cultural institution in Canada. He wants to cut taxes and hopes to approve pipelines that would diversify oil exports. He has also promised to be tough on crime and has denounced “woke-ism.” “Who’s ready for change in Canada? Who’s ready to ax some taxes? Who’s ready to build some homes? Who’s ready for some pipelines to make us independent from the Americans? And who’s ready to put Canada first for a change?” Poilievre said at a recent rally. ",World News,1

The former central banker appeared destined to become one of Canada’s shortest-serving prime ministers until U.S. President Donald Trump picked a fight with the neighboring country. Carney, who was sworn in on March 14 followingJustin Trudeau’s resignationand a Liberal Party leadership race, now leads in the polls heading into the April 28 parliamentary election, marking a dramatic turnaround for a party that seemed destined for a crushing defeat until Trumpstarted attacking Canada’s economy and sovereigntyalmost daily.

(Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP, File)    Carney navigated crises when he ran Canada’s central bank and when he later became the first non-U.K. citizen to run the Bank of England since its founding in 1694. His Bank of England appointment won bipartisan praise in the United Kingdom, after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called it “extraordinary” that a country would choose a foreigner to head its central bank, and that it’s a mark of how admired Carney is. “He is calm and cool in a crisis,” Paulson said. “He’s a clear thinker and he understands finance cold. He’s very well prepared.” Carney, 60, is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever, working with bankers to sustain lending through the financial crisis and, critically, letting the public know that rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  He was the first central banker to commit to keeping them at a historic-low level for a definite time — a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow. Carney also helped manage the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K. Paulson said that Carney has the “perfect background” for these challenging times. “Everything he’s done, he’s excelled at. Every job — the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England,” Paulson said. “I don’t know anyone who has dealt with him that doesn’t respect him. Whether they agree or disagree with him, they respect him. He’s got a very, very nice manner.” Both Conservative and Liberal prime ministers tried to make Carney their finance minister, the second-most powerful position in Canada’s government. Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper named Carney the Bank of Canada governor and later offered to make him finance minister. Trudeau, Carney’s Liberal predecessor, long wanted him as his finance minister. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.

When he was 6, his family moved to Edmonton, where his mother taught school and his father became a professor of education history at the University of Alberta. Carney earned a partial scholarship to Harvard University, where he was the backup goalie on the hockey team. Influenced by John Kenneth Galbraith, who pioneered the popular notion that economics should be accessible to the masses, Carney took up economics. A married father of four, Carney earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Harvard in 1988, and master’s and doctoral degrees in economics from Oxford University.

Trump mocked Carney’s predecessor by calling him Governor Trudeau. He hasn’t trolled Carney. But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this month that Trump hadn’t changed his position that Canada “would benefit greatly by becoming the 51st state.” Carney said that the 80-year period when the U.S. embraced the mantle of global economic leadership and forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect is over. “There is no going back. We in Canada will have to build a new relationship with the United States,” he said. If elected, Carney said that he would accelerate renegotiations of the free trade deal with the U.S. in an effort to end the uncertainty hurting both economies. “President Trump is trying to fundamentally restructure the international trading system and in the process he’s rupturing the global economy,” Carney said. “The core question is who is going to be at the table for Canada,” he said.",World News,1
Romania’s presidential election redo is a high-stakes test of its democracy following annulled vote,https://apnews.com/article/romania-election-presidency-europe-far-right-russia-baf335441276aa88859c010bc04da686,AP News,,19-04-25,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania’s presidential election redo next month will be a high-stakes test for the European Union member’s democracy after last year’s annulled vote triggered the country’sdeepest political crisissince 1989. Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the election on Dec. 6 after the far-rightoutsider Calin Georgescutopped first-round polls. The decision followed allegations ofelectoral violations and a Russian campaignpromoting Georgescu, who is now under investigation and barred from the rerun. Moscow has denied it meddled. “What happened last year was very serious and ... at that time, completely anti-democratic,” Elena Lasconi, who came second to enter the runoff last year and is participating in the new election, told The Associated Press. “It was not justified, in my opinion.” Once a communist state until the end of the Cold War, Romania has spent decades trying to build strong democratic institutions. But last year’s annulled election shattered public trust — and it could take years to repair the damage. “I think the public trust in political parties, in public institutions, in the state generally was quite low,” says Septimius Parvu, coordinator of the electoral program at Expert Forum, a pro-democracy think-tank. “This dislocated even more the trust. It created an earthquake which would … leave marks in the longer term on the trust in democracy.” Many feel Romanian authorities have not sufficiently explained what happened last year, which has left voters to wonder “whether this will be the final election,” Parvu added. Complicating Lasconi’s chances in the rerun, her Save Romania Union party, or USR, withdrew its support for her last week in favor of incumbent Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, claiming he has a stronger chance of winning the presidency. Lasconi labeled colleagues who moved against her as “coup plotters.” She said it adds to the chaos in the wake of last year’s election debacle, which has already left many Romanians disillusioned. “None of the state institutions have assured us that we’ll have fair elections,” she said. “People said in the streets, ‘our votes don’t count’.” Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says there is an “underlying social discontent that could explode again” unless political parties and candidates start to “speak to all segments of society.” “The underlying issue in Romania is the widespread public dissatisfaction with the political class,” he said. “It’s important to keep reminding the public of what happened: that we were facing a campaign that attempted to hijack Romania’s democracy using unorthodox and illegal means.” Georgescu’s stunning rise — from polling in single digits to leading the first round — shocked many observers. The Russia-friendly candidate, who has praised fascist figures from Romania’s past, not only unnerved Brussels but raised urgent questions about foreign interference in European elections. Like other EU countries, the far-right vote in recent years has grown in Romania, fueled by widespread anti-establishment sentiment. After Georgescu was barred from the redo, Romania’s far-right, which holds about a third of legislative seats, scrambled to find a successor. Up steppedGeorge Simion,the leader of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, who came fourth in last year’s race and later backed Georgescu. The second biggest party in the legislature, AUR, proclaims to stand for “family, nation, faith, and freedom.” Simion has drawn criticism in the past due to anti-EU rhetoric and remarks against continued aid to Ukraine, a neighboring country, which like Moldova, he is banned from entering over security concerns. Romania’s decision to annul the election, and the ban on Georgescu’s candidacy, has been strongly criticized by U.S. Vice President JD Vance,Elon Muskand Moscow — which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun. “Geopolitically, we are in a very complicated situation,” Lasconi warned. Eleven candidates are participating in the first round, which is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will be held on May 18. Other key candidates include Dan, the Bucharest mayor running independently under the campaign slogan “Honest Romania,” and Crin Antonescu, who is backed by Romania’s governing coalition and is running on a “Romania forward” platform. Victor Ponta, a former prime minister between 2012 and 2015 who resigned after a fatal nightclub fire, is running on a MAGA-style “Romania First” ticket and boasts of having close ties to the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. After last year’s events, data from local surveys should be taken with caution, given concerns about politicization. Still, a median of polls suggests a runoff could pit the far-right Simion against either Dan, Ponta, or Antonescu. A Simion presidency could threaten EU unity as the war rages on in neighboring Ukraine. This is compounded by Trump’s attempts to forge closer ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he seeks an end to the war in Ukraine. In the wake of the annulled election, the role social media allegedly played in Georgescu’s success came under intense scrutiny when declassified Romanian intelligence pointed to coordinated foreign interference via the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok. The case highlighted the threat large social media platforms can pose to liberal democracies, and the EU Commission responded bylaunching an ongoing probe into TikTokto determine whether it violated the EU’s Digital Services Act in failing to deal with risks to Romania’s election. TikTok said it dismantled covert influence networks targeting Romanians in December, including over 27,000 accounts, which posted comments en masse via a “fake engagement vendor” promoting the AUR party and Georgescu, “in an attempt to manipulate Romanian elections discourse.” It also removed more than 1,100 accounts impersonating presidential candidates. TikTok stated it has taken steps to protect Romania’s election integrity, including expanding its team of Romanian-speaking content moderators, working with a local fact-checking group to combat disinformation, and in-app tools linking to official election information. The concerns over social media, however, have led to what some critics view as undemocratic overreach by Romania’s Central Election Bureau ahead of the new vote. The bureau has drawn recent criticism for requesting takedowns of online political comments by private citizens. The political turbulencesparked large street protestsand has left many voters uncertain and divided. “Society is a bit divided, it’s fragmented in a way as a reaction,” said Octavian Frecea, a voter in Bucharest. “Only an isolated society isn’t influenced from the outside … We are economically and politically dependent on everyone.” As Romania heads into one of its most critical elections since 1989, the stakes go beyond who wins the next five-year presidency and may be viewed as a referendum on democracy. “We’ve been divided for over 35 years,” Lasconi said. “Now Romania isn’t just split in two — Romania is shattered into many pieces.”",World News,1
"Dutch leader of party in fragile ruling coalition quits politics, citing burnout",https://apnews.com/article/netherlands-politics-omtzigt-government-wilders-9b5570878059b5b4cd89537ef6f8ec1e,AP News,Molly Quel,18-04-25,"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Dutch centre-right leader Pieter Omtzigt announced Friday evening he is quitting both thefragile four-party ruling coalitionand national politics. Citing his mental health, the 51-year-old said in a social media video that he is unable to recover from burnout in the current political climate. “It was a huge honor and privilege to be a member of parliament for more than 21 years,” Omtzigt said in the surprise move. “But the toll has been quite high. That is why I am choosing to put my family first for the first time and to choose my own health.” His New Social Contract party, founded just two years ago, is the fourth largest in the Dutch parliament and formed part ofthe ruling coalition after months of negotiations last year. The government seemed on the brink of collapse over spring budget talks this week. In the previous nine months, it has nearly toppledafter the resignation of the finance state secretaryover what she saw as denigrating comments on immigrants and the refusal of the immigration minister to sign off on honors for volunteers who worked with refugees. Known for his sharp tongue and fiery anti-Islam rhetoric, the hard-right leaderGeert Wilders, who helms the largest party in parliament, was considered too controversial to lead the country but often dominates political negotiations. Omtzigt leaves the party in the hands of his deputy Nicolien van Vroonhoven, who took over in September when he was on medical leave. His fall departure was the second time he had stepped back from his duties for his mental health.  Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof wished Omtzigt well. “The Hague is losing a passionate and dedicated MP, a true representative of the people. I thank him for his efforts and our collaboration in recent times,” Schoof said on social media. A former member of the center-right Christian Democrats, Omtzigt’s new New Social Contract party immediately rocketed up opinion polls thanks to his reputation as a tireless crusader for whistleblowers and victims of government scandals. His key policy platform was reforming the Dutch political system that has been tarnished in recent years by scandals including the country’s tax office wrongly labelling thousands of child welfare recipients as fraudsters. He became a sensation during drawn-out talks to form the last Dutch coalition government when one of the negotiators was photographed carrying papers that included the text: “job elsewhere” next to his name. It was widely seen as a sign that the established political order wanted to be rid of a man who had long been a thorn in their side. It only served to bolster Omtzigt’s popularity.",World News,1

Israeli probe into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza finds ‘professional failures’,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-palestinians-israel-hamas-war-medics-killed-437b6ae1e9cf45b3099134524380f004,AP News,Melanie Lidman,21-04-25,"JERUSALEM (AP) — An Israeli investigation into thekillings of 15 Palestinian medics last month in Gazaby Israeli forces said Sunday it found a chain of “professional failures” and a deputy commander has been fired. The shootings outraged many in the international community, with some calling the killings a war crime. Medical workers have special protection under international humanitarian law. The International Red Cross/Red Crescent called it the deadliest attack on its personnel in eight years. Israel at first claimed that the medics’ vehicles did not have emergency signals on when troops opened fire but later backtracked. Cellphone video recovered from one medic contradicted Israel’s initial account. Footage shows the ambulances had lights flashing and logos visible as they pulled up to help another ambulance that earlier came under fire. The military investigation found that the deputy battalion commander acted under the incorrect assumption that all the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants. It said the deputy commander, operating under “poor night visibility,” felt his troops were under threat when the ambulances sped toward their position and medics rushed out to check the victims. The military said the flashing lights were less visible on night-vision drones and goggles. The ambulances immediately came under a barrage of gunfire that went on for more than five minutes with brief pauses. Minutes later, soldiers opened fire at a U.N. car that stopped at the scene. Eight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defense workers and a U.N. staffer were killed in the shooting before dawn on March 23 by troops conducting operations in Tel al-Sultan, a district of the southernGazacity of Rafah. Troops bulldozed over the bodies along with their mangled vehicles, burying them in a mass grave. U.N. and rescue workers were only able to reach the site a week later. The Israeli military said soldiers buried the bodies to prevent them from being mangled by stray dogs and coyotes until they could be collected, and that the ambulances were moved to allow the route to be used for civilian evacuations later that day. The investigation found that the decision to crush the ambulances was wrong but said there was no attempt to conceal the shootings. Mar. Gen. Yoav Har-Even, who oversees the military’s investigations, said the military notified international organizations later that day and helped rescue workers locate the bodies. The head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society has said the men were “targeted at close range.” Night-vision drone footage provided by the military shows soldiers were 20 to 30 meters away from the ambulances. The deputy commander was the first to open fire, leading the rest of the soldiers to start shooting, Har-Even said. The investigation found the paramedics were killed due to an “operational misunderstanding” by Israeli forces, and that shooting at the U.N. car was a breach of orders. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas militants — it did not give their names — and said three other paramedics were originally misidentified as Hamas. The Civil Defense is part of the Hamas-run government. No paramedic was armed and no weapons were found in any vehicle, Har-Even said. One survivor was detained for investigation and remains in custody for further questioning. According to the military, soldiers who questioned the survivor thought he identified himself as a Hamas member, which was later refuted. Har-Even said the deputy commander was fired for giving a not “completely accurate” report to investigators about the firing on a U.N. vehicle. The statement on the findings concluded by saying that Israel’s military “regrets the harm caused to uninvolved civilians.” “Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding. Too many civilians, including aid workers, have been killed in Gaza. Their stories have not all made the headlines,” Jonathan Whittall, interim head in Gaza of the U.N. humanitarian office OCHA, said in a statement responding to the findings. There was no immediate public reaction from the Red Crescent or Civil Defense. The findings have been turned over the Military Advocate General, which can decide whether to file civil charges. It is meant to be an independent body, with oversight by Israel’s attorney general and Supreme Court. There are no outside investigations of the killings underway. Israeli strikes have killed more than 150 emergency responders from the Red Crescent and Civil Defense, most of them while on duty, as well as over 1,000 health workers during the war, according to the U.N. The Israeli military rarely investigates such incidents. Israel has accused Hamas of moving and hiding its fighters inside ambulances and emergency vehicles, as well as in hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, arguing that justifies strikes on them. Medical personnel largely deny the accusations. Palestinians and international human rights groups have repeatedly accused Israel’s military of failing to properly investigate or whitewashing misconduct by its troops. Har-Even said the Israeli military is currently investigating 421 incidents in Gaza during the war, with 51 concluded and sent to the Military Advocate General. There was no immediate information on the number of investigations involving potential wrongful deaths or how many times the MAG has pursued criminal charges. The International Criminal Court, established by the international community as a court of last resort, hasaccused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuand former defense minister Yoav Gallant of war crimes. Israel, which is not a member of the court, has long asserted that its legal system is capable of investigating the army, and Netanyahu has accused the ICC of antisemitism. The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Hamas currently holds 59 hostages, 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel’s offensive has since killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according toGaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. Frustration has been growing on both sides, withrare public protests against Hamas in Gazaand continued weekly rallies in Israel pressing the government to reach a deal to bring all hostages home. ___ Follow coverage of the war athttps://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war",World News,1
US and Iran say talks over Tehran’s nuclear program make progress and set plans for more,https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-nuclear-negotiations-rome-oman-5539236d72216f55aa7766be90b963b2,AP News,Jon Gambrell,19-04-25,"ROME (AP) — Iran and the United States plan to meet over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program again next week, after both sides said they made progress in their talks Saturday in Rome. A U.S. official confirmed that at a point during the negotiations in Rome, PresidentDonald Trump’sspecial envoySteve Witkoffand Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke face to face. Before they meet again in Oman on April 26, Araghchi said technical-level talks would be held in the coming days. That experts would be discussing details of a possible deal suggests movement in the talks and comes as Trump has pushed for a rapid agreement whilethreatening military action against Iran. The sides “made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,” according to a senior Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private diplomatic meeting. In apost on X, Araghchi similarly said they made “progress on principles and objectives of a possible deal.” He added, however, that “optimism may be warranted but only with a great deal of caution.” He told Iranian state television earlier that “I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.” While the U.S. said both direct and indirect discussions were held, Iranian officials described them as indirect, like those last weekend in Muscat, Oman, with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi shuttling between them in different rooms.  “These talks are gaining momentum and now even the unlikely is possible,” al-Busaidi said on X. In aseparate post, Oman’s Foreign Ministry said the sides agreed to keep talking to seek a deal that ensures Iran is “completely free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, and maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy.” That talks are even happening represents a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries sincethe 1979 Islamic Revolutionand theU.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran’s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on theirthreats to pursue an atomic weapon. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have spiked overthe Israel-Hamas war in the Gazaand after U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebelskilled more than 70 peopleand wounded dozens more. “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,” Trump said Friday. “I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.” Before the Iran talks started, Witkoff met in Rome with Rafael Mariano Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, according to a person familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of anonymity to share details that were not made public. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency would likely be key in verifying compliance by Iran should a deal be reached, as it did with the 2015 accord Iran reached with world powers. In a flurry of gatherings, Grossi also met with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who sat down with Araghchi before the U.S.-Iran talks. A diplomatic deal “is built patiently, day after day, with dialogue and mutual respect,” Tajani said in a statement. Witkoff had been in Parisfor talks about Ukraineas Russia’s full-scale war there grinds on. He also met in the French capital with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, and Mossad chief David Barnea. Dermer was in Rome on Saturday and spotted at the same hotel where Witkoff was staying. It was unclear if that was a coincidence, and there was no indication Dermer was part of the Iran talks. Araghchi in recent days paida visit to Moscow, where he met withRussian President Vladimir Putin. Russia, one of the world powers involved in Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal, could be a key participant in any future deal reached between Tehran and Washington. Analysts suggest Moscow could potentially take custody of Iran’s uranium enriched to 60% purity — a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Oman’s capitalhosted the first round of negotiationslast weekend, which saw Araghchi and Witkoff meet face to face after indirect talks. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served asan interlocutor between Iran and the West. Ahead of the talks, however, Iran seized on comments by Witkoff first suggesting Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, wrote on X before the talks that Iran would not accept giving up its enrichment program like Libya or agreeing to using uranium enriched abroad for its nuclear program. “Iran has come for a balanced agreement, not a surrender,” he wrote. Iran’s internal politics are still inflamed overthe mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past Iran’s rial currency plunged toover 1 million to a U.S. dollarearlier this month. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue. Meanwhile, two used Airbus A330-200 long sought by Iran’s flag carrier, Iran Air, arrived at Tehran’s Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. The planes, formerly of China’s Hainan Airlines, had been in Muscat and re-registered to Iran. The aircraft have Rolls-Royce engines, which include significant American parts and servicing. Such a transaction would need approval from the U.S. Treasury given sanctions on Iran. The State Department and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment. Under the 2015 deal, Iran could purchase new aircraft and had lined uptens of billions of dollars in deals with Airbus and Boeing Co.However, the manufacturers backed away from the deals over Trump’s threats to the nuclear accord. ___ Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

His friends, terrified, ran to find an ambulance, but Khalil, 21, thought they had abandoned him.

I didn’t think I would survive this.” Khalil’s left leg was badly wounded in the first explosion, while his right leg was blown off from above the knee in the second. He used his shirt to tourniquet the stump and screamed for help until a soldier nearby heard him and rushed for his aid.

Khalil, who is from the village of Qaminas, in the southern part of Syria’s Idlib province, is engaged and dreams of a prosthetic limb so he can return to work and support his family again. While the nearly 14-yearSyrian civil warcame to an end with the fall ofBashar Assadon Dec. 8, war remnants continue to kill and maim. Contamination from land mines and explosive remnants has killed at least 249 people, including 60 children, and injured another 379 since Dec. 8, according to INSO, an international organization which coordinates safety for aid workers.

(AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed)  Mines and explosive remnants — widely used since 2011 by Syrian government forces, its allies, and armed opposition groups — have contaminated vast areas, many of which only became accessible after theAssad government’s collapse, leading to a surge in the number of land mine casualties, according to a recent Human Rights Watch (HRW) report.

(AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed)  Prior to Dec. 8, land mines and explosive remnants of war also frequently injured or killed civilians returning home and accessing agricultural land. “Without urgent, nationwide clearance efforts, more civilians returning home to reclaim critical rights, lives, livelihoods, and land will beinjured and killed,” said Richard Weir, a senior crisis and conflict researcher at HRW. Experts estimate that tens of thousands of land mines remain buried acrossSyria, particularly in former front-line regions like rural Idlib. “We don’t even have an exact number,” said Ahmad Jomaa, a member of a demining unit under Syria’s defense ministry. “It will take ages to clear them all.” Jomaa spoke while scanning farmland in a rural area east of Maarrat al-Numan with a handheld detector, pointing at a visible anti-personnel mine nestled in dry soil. “This one can take off a leg,” he said. “We have to detonate it manually.” Suleiman Khalil, 21, who lost his leg in a landmine explosion while harvesting olives with his friends in a field, walks outside his home in the village of Qaminas, east of Idlib, Syria, Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed)  Farming remains the main source of income for residents in rural Idlib, making the presence of mines a daily hazard. Days earlier a tractor exploded nearby, severely injuring several farm workers, Jomaa said. “Most of the mines here are meant for individuals and light vehicles, like the ones used by farmers,” he said. Jomaa’s demining team began dismantling the mines immediately after the previous government was ousted. But their work comes at a steep cost. “We’ve had 15 to 20 (deminers) lose limbs, and around a dozen of our brothers were killed doing this job,” he said. Advanced scanners, needed to detect buried or improvised devices, are in short supply, he said. Many land mines are still visible to the naked eye, but others are more sophisticated and harder to detect. Land mines not onlykill and maimbut also cause long-term psychological trauma and broader harm, such as displacement, loss of property, and reduced access to essential services, HRW says. The rights group has urged the transitional government to establish a civilian-led mine action authority in coordination with the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) to streamline and expand demining efforts. Syria’s military under the Assad government laid explosives years ago to deter opposition fighters. Even after the government seized nearby territories, it made little effort to clear the mines it left behind.

Every day someone is dying.’” Mohammad was 39 when he died on Jan. 12 while demining in a village in Idlib. A former Syrian Republican Guard member trained in planting and dismantling mines, he later joined the opposition during the uprising, scavenging weapon debris to make arms. He worked with Turkish units in Azaz, a city in northwest Syria, using advanced equipment, but on the day he died, he was on his own. As he defused one mine, another hidden beneath it detonated. After Assad’s ouster, mines littered his village in rural Idlib. He had begun volunteering to clear them — often without proper equipment — responding to residents’ pleas for help, even on holidays when his demining team was off duty, his brother said. For every mine cleared by people like Mohammad, many more remain. In a nearby village, Jalal al-Maarouf, 22, was tending to his goats three days after the Assad government’s collapse when he stepped on a mine. Fellow shepherds rushed him to a hospital, where doctors amputated his left leg. He has added his name to a waiting list for a prosthetic, “but there’s nothing so far,” he said from his home, gently running a hand over the smooth edge of his stump. “As you can see, I can’t walk.” The cost of a prosthetic limb is in excess of $3,000 and far beyond his means.",World News,1
Protest letters from former Israeli soldiers lay bare profound rifts over the ongoing war,https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-palestinians-hamas-war-ceasefire-netanyahu-f6d2d8de22fdeac11006f68a13efa1fc,AP News,Melanie Lidman,18-04-25,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — When nearly 1,000 Israeli Air Force veteranssigned an open letter last weekcalling for an end to the war in Gaza, the military responded immediately, saying it would dismiss any active reservist who signed the document. But in the days since, thousands of retired and reservist soldiers across the military have signed similar letters of support. The growing campaign, which accuses the government of perpetuating the war for political reasons and failing to bring home the remaining hostages, has laid bare the deep division and disillusionment overIsrael’s fighting in Gaza. By spilling over into the military, it has threatened national unity and raised questions about the army’s ability to continue fighting at full force. It also resembles thebitter divisions that erupted in early 2023over the government’s attempts to overhaul Israel’s legal system, which many say weakened the country and encouraged Hamas’ attack later that year that triggered the war. “It’s crystal clear that the renewal of the war is for political reasons and not for security reasons,” Guy Poran, a retired pilot who was one of the initiators of the air force letter, told The Associated Press.  The catalyst for the letters was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’sdecision on March 18 to return to warinstead of sticking to a ceasefire that had facilitated the release of some hostages. Netanyahu says the military pressure is needed to force Hamas to release the remaining hostages. Critics, including many families of the hostages, fear that it will get them killed. One month after Netanyahu resumed the war, none of the 59 hostages held by Hamas have been freed or rescued, of whom 24 are believed to still be alive. In their letters, the protesters have stopped short of refusing to serve. And the vast majority of the 10,000 soldiers who have signed are retired in any case. Nonetheless, Poran said their decision to identify themselves as ex-pilots was deliberate — given the respect among Israel’s Jewish majority for the military, and especially for fighter pilots and other prestigious units. Tens of thousands of academics, doctors, former ambassadors, students and high-tech workers have signed similar letters of solidarity in recent days, also demanding an end to the war. “We are aware of the relative importance and the weight of the brand of Israeli Air Force pilots and felt that it is exactly the kind of case where we should use this title in order to influence society,” said Poran. The war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas carried out a surprise cross-border attack, killing about 1,200 people in southern Israel and taking 251 others hostage. Throughout the war, Netanyahu has set two major goals: destroying Hamas and bringing home the hostages. Israel’s offensive has reduced much of Gaza to rubble and killed more than 51,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who don’t differentiate between civilians and combatants. While Israel has come under heavy international criticism over thedevastation in Gaza, the domestic opposition to the conflict reflects a widespread belief that Netanyahu’s war goals are not realistic. Nearly 70% of Israelis now say bringing home the hostages is the most important goal of the war, up from just over 50% in January 2024, according to a study conducted by the Jerusalem think tank Israel Democracy Institute. Nearly 60% of respondents said Netanyahu’s two goals cannot be realized together. The survey interviewed nearly 750 people and had a margin of error of 3.6 percentage points. Netanyahu’s opponents have also accused him of resuming the war to pander to his hardline coalition partners, who have threatened to topple the government if he ends the fighting. Many people were surprised by the military’s snap decision to dismiss air force reservists who signed the protest letter. The army, which is mandatory for most Jewish men, has long served as a melting pot and unifying force among Israel’s Jewish majority. Many key units rely heavily on reservists, who often to serve well into their 40s. In a statement, the military said it should be “above all political dispute.” As the protest movement has grown, a military official said the army is taking the letters “very seriously.” He said it joins a list of challenges to calling up reservists and that the army is working to support them. A growing number of reservists have stopped reporting for duty, citing exhaustion, family reasons, and the financial burden of missing work. “Any civilian can have his opinions. The problems come when people use the army as a tool promoting their opinions, whatever they may be,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity under military guidelines. Eran Duvdevani, who organized a letter signed by 2,500 former paratroopers, told the AP that the army faces a dilemma. “If it will keep on releasing from service the pilots, what about all the others who signed the letters? Will they be discharged from service as well?” he said. He said he organized the letter to show “the pilots are not alone.” Their concern over the war’s direction “is a widespread opinion, and you have to take it into consideration.” Although only a few hundred of the signatories are still actively serving, the Israeli military has been stretched by 18 months of fighting and isn’t in any position to be turning away anyone from reserve duty. Many Israelis are also furious that as reservists repeatedly get called up for action, thegovernment continues to grant military exemptionsto Netanyahu’s ultra-Orthodox governing partners. The number of Israelis continuing to report for reserve duty has dropped so low that the military has taken to social media to try to recruit people to keep serving. Eran Halperin, an expert in social psychology at Jerusalem’s Hebrew University, called the letters “the most important indication of the erosion of the ethos in this particular war.” Though the war enjoyed widespread support at the outset, doubts have grown as so many hostages continue to languish in captivity and the Israeli death toll mounts. Nearly 850 soldiers have been killed since the war started. “It’s very, very difficult to maintain and manage a war in such violent conflict when there are such deep disagreements about the main questions pertaining to the war,” Halperin said. In recent days, Netanyahu’s office has published a flurry of messages touting meetings with families of the hostages, stressing he is doing everything he can to hasten their return. On Tuesday, he and his defense minister toured northern Gaza, where Netanyahu praised the “amazing reservists” doing “marvelous work.” Netanyahu’s office released videos of him marching through the sandy dunes surrounded by dozens of soldiers. “We are fighting for our existence,” he said. “We are fighting for our future.”",World News,1
Deadly US airstrike on Yemeni oil port escalates Trump’s campaign against the Houthis,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-us-airstrikes-563f61bbd96e1f2de68373fdf76c8811,AP News,Jon Gambrell,19-04-25,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A U.S. airstrike on an important oil port held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded many others, the Iranian-backed rebel group said Friday, marking a major escalation in the military campaign President Donald Trumplaunched against the factionlast month.  The overnight strike on the Ras Isa port sent massive fireballs billowing skyward and turned tanker trucks into burning wrecks. It was the first American attack on a Houthi-controlled oil facility in the new U.S. bombing campaign. It also came just beforethe resumption of negotiationsin Rome between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran’srapidly advancing nuclear program, which Washington has linked to its attacks in Yemen. The U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group’s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel. The port is a major hub for incoming fuel shipments that power areas of Yemen held by the Houthis, and analysts say the airstrike could seriously affect daily life there. TheHouthis, who said the attack killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, aired graphic footage of the aftermath on their al-Masirah satellite news channel, showing corpses strewn about the port and smashed tanker trucks. They denounced the strike as a “completely unjustified aggression.”   This photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a severely wounded person onto a stretcher after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP)  AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people with 170 others wounded, the group says. “It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,” the group said in a statement.  In this photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows a burning oil tanker after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP)  U.S. Central Command declined to answer any questions about possible civilian casualties but referred to a statement in which it said “this strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.” “U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” it said in its statement. A U.S. official said the attack sent a message to those supplying fuel to the Houthis despite sanctions. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public. Hours after the U.S. strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Houthis said they shot down another American MQ-9 Predator drone, which the U.S. official acknowledged.    The Ras Isa port is a collection of oil tanks and equipment that sits in Yemen’s Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes in recent days. Before the Houthis took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and sent the government into exile, oil from the country’senergy-rich Marib governoratemoved through Ras Isa for export. But since the Houthis don’t control that region, the port now serves as an import hub for gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas that help power those parts of Yemen the Houthis control.  The new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Trump appearsmore extensivethan attacks on the group were under President Joe Biden,an AP reviewfound. The new campaign started after the rebelsthreatened to begin targeting “Israeli” shipsagain over Israel blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip. From November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them andkilling four sailors.That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success. Assessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn’t released information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don’t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.  This photo taken from video released by Al Masirah TV channel shows medics carrying a dead person after U.S. airstrikes targeted the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels in Hodeida, Yemen, Friday, April 18, 2025.( Al Masirah TV via AP)  The Ras Isa port airstrike is the deadliest known attack yet in the month-old campaign. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank. “Since they are targeting civilian areas, there’s a lot more victims. But it’s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,” Nevola said. Further complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack thatTrump highlighted onlinewith black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters. “Although the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,” al-Basha said. “However, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.” The AP analyzed satellite images of the port provided by Planet Labs PBC that showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles, and what appeared to be oil leaking into the Red Sea. Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines. The U.S. airstrikes continued overnight into early Saturday, with the Houthis reporting them in Yemen’s al-Jawf, Sadaa and Sanaa governorates.  A U.S. State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, accused a Chinese commercial satellite image provider, Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., of “directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.” During a briefing with reporters, Bruce did not elaborate in detail. But she acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the company linked to the People’s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor. Bruce said “Beijing’s support” of the satellite company ... “contradicts their claims of being peace supporters.” Responding to a question about the allegation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Friday: “I am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.” However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries “to make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.” “Since the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,” Lin said. “Who is promoting talks for peace and deescalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?” The company didn’t respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned it in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary forcethe Wagner Groupas it fought in Ukraine. It remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.

Hezbollah says it won’t hand over weapons while Israeli troops remain in southern Lebanon,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-hezbollah-weapons-israel-3c43dda33a8fc795b491bc8976c17113,AP News,,19-04-25,"BEIRUT (AP) — The leader of Lebanon’s militant Hezbollah group said on Friday that its fighters will not disarm as long as Israeli troops remain in southern Lebanon and the Israeli air force regularly violates Lebanese air space. Naim Kassemaddressed supporters in a speech broadcast on Hezbollah’s television station. Kassem took over Hezbollah afterIsraeli airstrikes killed longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, his successorHashem Safieddineand other top Hezbollah figures last year, decimating the group’s leadership. Kassem said Hezbollah had implemented its commitments related to the U.S.-brokered ceasefire that halted the fighting in Hezbollah’s latest, 14-month war with Israel. Since the ceasefire went into effect in late November, Israeli airstrikes have killed scores of people in Lebanon including civilians and Hezbollah members. Israel says it’s targeting Hezbollah holdouts in southern Lebanon. On Tuesday, the office of the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said that at least 71 civilians, including 14 women and nine children, have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since the ceasefire took effect. Hezbollah launched its own attacks on Israel a day after theIsrael-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023with the Palestinian militants’ attack on southern Israel, saying it was doing so to ease the pressure on Gaza by keeping part of the Israeli military busy along the northern Israeli border with Lebanon.  In response, Israeli troops pushed into Lebanon. The 14 months of the Hezbollah-Israel war killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and caused destruction that will take$11 billion to rebuild, according to the World Bank. As part of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was to pull out from parts of southern Lebanon and give up its military positions and weapons south of the Litani River while Israeli forces were to pull back into Israel. The Lebanese army was to take over Hezbollah’s positions and guarantee security in the south, along with the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Israel withdrew much of its troops from southern Lebanon in February but keptfive posts inside Lebaneseterritory in what Lebanon says is a violation of the ceasefire deal. Last week, deputy U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle EastMorgan Ortagus visited Beirutand called on the Lebanese state to assert its control all over Lebanon — and not only in the south along the border with Israel south of the Litani River. “We will not allow anyone to remove Hezbollah’s weapons,” Kassem said. “These weapons gave life and freedom to our people.” Kassem spoke hours after two separate Israeli drones killed two people in southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it killed two Hezbollah members in the strikes. “Does anyone expect us to discuss a national defense strategy as warplanes fly over our heads and there is occupation in south Lebanon,” Kassem asked. “These are not discussions. This is surrender. Let Israel withdraw first and stop its flights in the air.”",World News,1
Lebanon detains several people on suspicion of firing rockets at Israel,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-rockets-palestinians-detained-hamas-7c2be638daa75ecc39e5c89515d616b7,AP News,,17-04-25,"BEIRUT (AP) — The Lebanese military said it has detained a group of people linked to firing rockets into Israel last month. The army said in a statement late Wednesday that those detained included a number of Palestinians who were involved in firing rockets in two separate attacks toward Israel in late March that triggeredintense Israeli airstrikeson parts of Lebanon. Lebanon’s Hezbollah group denied at the time it was behind the firing of rockets. Since the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire in late November ended their 14-month conflict, Israel has carried out almost daily airstrikes that left dozens of civilians and Hezbollah members dead. The army said that a vehicle and other equipment used in the rockets attacks were confiscated and the detainees were referred to judicial authorities. The army said it had carried out raids in different parts of Lebanon to detain the suspects without giving further details. On Thursday, the state-run National News Agency reported that Gen. Rodolph Haikal briefed a weekly cabinet meeting about the security situation along the border and the ongoing implementation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 14-monthIsrael-Hezbollah war. Three security and one judicial officials told The Associated Press that four Palestinians linked to the Hamas group are being questioned. A Hamas official told the AP that several members of the group were detained in Lebanon recently and released shortly afterward adding that they were not involved in firing rockets into Israel. He said in one case authorities detained a Hamas member who was carrying an unlicensed pistol.  All officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. Hezbollah started launching attacks on Israel a day after the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct. 7, 2023, with the Palestinian militants’ attack on southern Israel. The war that left more than 4,000 people dead in Lebanon and causedwide destructionended in late November with aU.S.-brokered ceasefire. On Tuesday, the office of the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said that at least 71 civilians, including 14 women and nine children, have been killed by Israeli strikes in Lebanon since a ceasefire took effect. Lebanese Information Minister Paul Morcos said Thursday in a press conference following a cabinet meeting that Lebanon has recorded 2,740 Israeli violations of the ceasefire and that 190 people have been killed and 485 injured in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since the ceasefire began. He did not specify how many were civilians. Israel has said that its strikes in Lebanon are in response to ceasefire violations by Hezbollah and to prevent the group from rearming.",World News,1
Russian attacks during Easter ceasefire declared by Putin killed 3 in Ukraine’s Kherson region,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-easter-ceasefire-26e8cc7c934a70c52bd3fab0e58808b8,AP News,,21-04-25,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian attacks during the 30-hour Easterceasefire unilaterally declared by President Vladimir Putinover the weekend killed three people in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, a regional official said Monday. Oleksandr Prokudin, the head of Kherson’s administration, wrote on Telegram that the casualties occurred over the last 24 hours, adding that three others were wounded in the region, parts of which are occupied by Russia. After Putin declared the move on Saturday, Ukraine responded by voicing readiness to reciprocate any genuine ceasefire but said the Russian attacks continued. Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid that Russia violated the ceasefire more than 2,900 times. Zelenskyy said that Russian forces carried out 96 assault operations along the front line, shelled Ukrainian positions more than 1,800 times and used hundreds of drones during the course of the ceasefire. “The nature of Ukrainian actions will continue to be mirror-like: we will respond to silence with silence, and our blows will be a defense against Russian blows. Actions always speak louder than words,” he said. The Russian Defense Ministry, for its part, listed 4,900 Ukrainian violations of the ceasefire. It charged that Moscow’s forces “strictly observed the ceasefire and remained at previously occupied lines and positions.” Speaking Monday, Putin said that the fighting resumed after the ceasefire expired at midnight (2100 GMT). Commenting on Zelenskyy’s call for a comprehensive 30-day ceasefire or, at least, a halt on strikes on civilian facilities, the Russian leader noted that Kyiv was trying to “seize the initiative,” adding that “we must think about it, carefully assess everything and look at the results of the ceasefire.”  The Russian leader has previously made a full ceasefire conditional on halting Western arms supplies to Kyiv and Ukraine’s mobilization effort — demands rejected by Ukraine. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that Russia would inform “all the interested parties” about the Ukrainian violations of the ceasefire. Peskov said that Russia “remains open to searching for a peaceful settlement and is continuing to work with the American side,” adding that “we certainly hope that this work will produce results.” Asked if there is a proposal from the U.S. that Kyiv recognize Crimea that Moscow annexed in 2014 as part of Russia, President Donald Trump responded that “I will be giving you a full detail over the next three days,” adding that “we had very good meetings on Ukraine, Russia.” Zelenskyy has firmly ruled out the recognition of any temporarily occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian. On Monday, the Ukrainian president spoke to U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer ahead of Wednesday’s talks between Ukrainian, British, French and U.S. officials in London. “We are ready to move forward as constructively as possible, just as we have done before, to achieve an unconditional ceasefire, followed by the establishment of a real and lasting peace,” Zelenskyy said on X. “An unconditional ceasefire must be the first step toward peace, and this Easter made it clear that it is Russia’s actions that are prolonging the war.” Overnight into Monday, the Russian forces fired three missiles at Ukraine’s southern regions of Kherson and Mykolaiv regions, as well as 96 Shahed drones targeting other parts of the country, Ukraine’s Air Force reported. It said it downed 42 drones, while 47 others were jammed mid-flight. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, Russian drones sparked a fire at an “outbuilding” and a “food enterprise,” regional administration head Serhii Lysak wrote on Telegram. No one was injured in the attack, he said. An unspecified infrastructure object was damaged in the Cherkasy region overnight, regional head Ihor Taburets said on Telegram. Four civilians also sustained injuries in the partially occupied Donetsk region, according to regional head Vadym Filashkin, who said that the Russian forces shelled settlements in the region five times over the last 24 hours. ___ Chris Megerian contributed to this report from Washington.

Ukrainians mark Easter with little faith in Russia ceasefire,https://apnews.com/article/easter-ukraine-russia-war-ceasefire-zelenskyy-putin-741a336b842e12057a2ae3aa8f0ef4b0,AP News,Hanna Arhirova,20-04-25,"LUKASHIVKA, Ukraine (AP) — Dozens of Ukrainians gathered outside the ruins of a damaged church in northern Ukraine on Sunday to mark Easter,doubting a ceasefire with Russia is possible. Kyiv has voiced skepticism about the Easter ceasefire announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin and said that Ukrainian forces would only mirror a genuine halt in hostilities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday night thatRussian strikes had continued, although with less intensity. In the village of Lukashivka in the Chernihiv region, briefly occupied by Russian forces in 2022, parishioners of the damaged Ascension Church arrived early at a small makeshift wooden church built last year to cater to the needs of the faithful, holding traditional Easter baskets and cakes to have them blessed. As the sun rose, they stood quietly in the spring chill, the roofless silhouette of the wrecked church behind them, its pale walls scarred by shell fragments. The church’s priest, Serhii Zezul, walked among them, shouting “Christ is risen!” as he sprinkled holy water over the baskets — his voice nearly drowned out by the hum of a nearby generator. The restoration of the original church, a 20th-century architectural landmark, would require at least hundreds of thousands of dollars, money the community doesn’t have as the war rages on. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, about 530 churches across Ukraine have been damaged or destroyed, and at least 25 clergy members have been killed, according to Ruslan Khalikov, head of the “Religion on Fire” project, which monitors Russian war crimes against religious communities. “A destroyed church is a shattered soul of the community,” Zezul said. “When churches fall, the heart and core that unite people begin to collapse.” More people than usual gathered in the damaged church’s courtyard on Sunday. Some said they drove from cities to Lukashivka to mark Easter, fearing Russian forces might target large gatherings, especially after a recent string of missile strikes killed dozens of civilians. For 26 years, 44-year-old Olha Rudeno attended church in the nearby city of Chernihiv, where she got married. “But given the war, it’s psychologically difficult for me to go where there are large gatherings in cities,” she said. Rudeno doesn’t think a ceasefire with Russia will happen. “Believing in a ceasefire is deceiving yourself. I don’t know how much time has to pass for me to truly believe one is possible,” she said. Doubt of a truce between Russia and Ukraine has deepened as U.S.-led efforts have so far yielded no breakthrough. Moscow has effectively rejected a separate, comprehensive ceasefire proposal, backed by President Donald Trump and endorsed by Ukraine. The Kremlin has tied any agreement to a halt in Kyiv’s troop mobilization and Western arms supplies — conditions Ukraine has refused, fearing they would allow Russia to regroup and escalate. “My personal opinion is that there will be no ceasefire,” said Zezul. “And even if there is one, there are no details on where it would apply. On the front line, our soldiers are still fighting.” Still, Zezul said that celebrating Easter among ruins reflects the resilience of faith during war. “Despite everything, people still gather. They believe in something better. We are being reborn, we are standing back up. Truth always triumphs over evil. People believe that, they hope for that.” In his Easter message, Zelenskyy reflected on suffering and the struggle to hold on to faith. “Each of us has lived through such moments ... and you ask: ‘God, why is this happening to us?’” He also mentioned the deadly missile strike on Sumy during Palm Sunday, and the bombardments of Kryvyi Rih, Kharkiv, Dnipro, Odesa, and other cities, saying people tend to turn inward when they can’t make sense of things. “Something invisible yet powerful within us doesn’t let us give up. It shows us where to find the light, so we don’t lose our way.” ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine athttps://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World News,1
Zelenskyy says Russia is trying to create an ‘impression of a ceasefire’ as attacks continue,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-easter-ceasefire-zelenskyy-putin-attacks-934e5c2a493be32b605ddb84d955b34b,AP News,,21-04-25,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accusedRussiaon Sunday of creating a false appearance of honoring an Easter ceasefire, saying Moscow continued to launch attacks after Russian President Vladimir Putin announceda unilateral temporary truce. “As of Easter morning, we can say that the Russian army is trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places, it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. DespitePutin’s declaration of an Easter ceasefire, Zelenskyy said Sunday morning that Ukrainian forces had recorded 59 instances of Russian shelling and five assaults by units along the front line, as well as dozens of drone strikes. In later updates, Zelenskyy said that despite Ukraine declaring a symmetrical approach to Russian actions, “the trend of increasing the use of heavy weaponry by Russian forces continues.” He said, however, that it was “a good thing, at least, that there were no air raid sirens.” He noted that some Ukrainian troops were killed in a Russian “ambush” on Sunday in the Donetsk region, and said the Russian soldiers responsible would be “eliminated.” Russia’s Defense Ministry accused Ukrainian forces of overnight attacks in the Donetsk region despite the ceasefire. It said Ukraine had sent 48 drones into Russian territory. According to the ministry, there were “dead and wounded among the civilian population,” without giving details. It claimed Russian troops had strictly observed the truce.  Russia-installed officials in the partially occupied Ukrainian region of Kherson also said Ukrainian forces had launched attacks. Zelenskyy said that Russia must fully adhere to the ceasefire conditions and reiterated Ukraine’s offer to extend the truce for 30 days when it ends midnight Sunday. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ said Moscow had not responded to Kyiv’s proposal. “In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,” Zelenskyy wrote. Just hours after announcing the ceasefire, Putin attended an Easter service late Saturday at Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church and a vocal supporter of Putin and the war in Ukraine. Putin offered no details on how the ceasefire would be monitored or whether it would cover airstrikes or ongoing ground battles that rage around the clock. His announcement came after U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid Friday that negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are “coming to a head” and insisted that neither side is “playing” him in hispush to end the grinding three-year war. The State Department said Sunday that the U.S. is committed to “a full and comprehensive ceasefire.” It noted encouraging discussions this past week in Paris about peace prospects in Ukraine, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio conveyed in a call to his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the war in Ukraine athttps://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine___ Morton reported from London.",World News,1
Big Tech’s ‘Magnificent Seven’ heads into earnings season reeling from Trump turbulence,https://apnews.com/article/big-tech-earnings-trump-tariffs-350f0fc6b2b9d70339bfbaedbe0ba7f9,AP News,Michael Liedtke,21-04-25,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry’s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn’t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago. Since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid anonslaught of tariffsand other potentially detrimental actions. It’s the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when theyassembled behind Trumpas he was sworn in. That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump’s second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden’s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunitiesin artificial intelligenceanddeal-making. But the Trump administration’s policies so far have vexed Big Tech’s “Magnificent Seven” companies — a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump’s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20. The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump’s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech’s supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.  That has left the specter of Trump’s ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world. “The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump’s tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators’ allegations thatMeta has been running an illegal monopolyin social networking, and working to persuade a federal judgeto break up Googleafter its search engine last year was found to beillegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobbleAppleandAmazon. And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company torecord a $5.5 billion chargeto account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country. Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies’ financial reports for the January-March quarter. The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that itsfirst-quarter car sales dropped by 13%from the same time last year. The decline occurred against a backdrop ofvandalism,widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycottamid a backlash to Musk’s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies. After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla’s market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: ; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Amazon and Apple on May 1. Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results. —- This story corrects the date that Amazon will release its quarterly earnings to May 1.",World News,1
Wall Street and the dollar tumble as investors retreat further from the United States,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-inflation-trump-68a6a7f7765d78d46329abbecfbe0797,AP News,,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are tumbling Monday as worries aboutPresident Donald Trump’s trade warand his criticism of the Federal Reserve cause investors to pull further from the United States. The S&P 500 was 3.1% lower in another wipeout, and the index at the center of many 401(k) accounts is more than 16% below its record set two months ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,138 points, or 2.9%, as of 1:21 p.m. Eastern time. Tesla and other Big Tech stocks had some of the sharpest losses, which dragged the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 3.4%. Perhaps more worryingly, thevalue of the U.S. dollaralso sank as a retreat continues from U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because the dollar has historically strengthened during past episodes of nervousness. But this time around, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening the dollar’s reputation as a pillar of the global economy. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade over the weekend, even as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could causea recessionif they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan have so far failed to reach a deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps.  Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which upped its own rhetoric against the world’s largest economy. China on Mondaywarned other countriesagainst making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market areworries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last weekcriticized Powell againfor not cutting interest rates sooner to help give the economy more juice. The Fed has beenresistant to lowering rates too quicklybecause it does not want to allowinflationto reaccelerate after it has slowed nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trumptalked again on Mondayabout a slowing for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates.” A move to fire Powell would likely send a huge bolt of fear through financial markets. While investors always love lower interest rates, because they boost prices for stocks and other investments, the larger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control in the long run. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. On Wall Street, several Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lowerahead of their latest earnings reportsdue later this week. Tesla sank 7.4%, for example. The electric vehicle’s stock came into Monday roughly 50% below its record set in December on criticism that its stock price had gone too high and that itsbrand has become too entwinedwith Elon Musk, who’s leading the U.S.government’s efforts to cut spending. Nvidiafell 6.1% and was on track for a third straight drop after disclosing that new U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. It was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500. A 3.4% drop for Apple, 2.5% fall for Microsoft and 4% slide for Amazon were close behind. It was another wipeout on Wall Street, and 98% of the stocks within the S&P 500 were falling. Among the few gainers was Discover Financial Services, which climbed after theU.S. government approved its proposed merger with Capital One Financial. Discover rose 2.7%, while Capital One edged higher by 0.7%. Gold was also rising, burnishing its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors keep alive hopes that the Fed may cut its main overnight interest rate later this year in order to support the economy. Longer-term yields swiveled up and down, though, as doubtscontinue to rise about the United States’ standingin the global economy because of Trump’s moves. The yield on the 10-year Treasury reached 4.40%. That’s up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market.

China warns countries against making trade deals with the US unfavorable to Beijing,https://apnews.com/article/chian-us-tariffs-retaliation-18b3da9bed1aa1b3ee3a79e91c197730,AP News,,21-04-25,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States to China’s detriment. Governments including those of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have begun negotiations with Washington after President Donald Trumpannounced sweeping tariffsagainst almost all of America’s trading partners on April 2. The import taxes were quickly paused against most countries after markets panicked, but he increased his already steep tariffs against China. “China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner. China is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this month the countries currently negotiating trade deals with the U.S. should “approach China as a group” together with Washington. The U.S. tariffs against other countries are economic bullying, the ministry said in the statement attributed to an unnamed spokesperson. “Appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot win respect,” it added. “For one’s own temporary selfish interests, sacrificing the interests of others in exchange for so-called exemptions is like seeking the skin from a tiger. It will ultimately only fail on both ends and harm others without benefiting themselves.”  China said it’s open to talks with Washington but no meetings have been announced. Trump made China the target of his steepest tariffs, imposing several rounds of tariffs totaling 145% duties on Chinese imports. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on U.S. imports. The tariffs have spooked exporters andstalled shipments, while threatening to drag on the global economy.",World News,1
Google faces off with US government in attempt to break up company in search monopoly case,https://apnews.com/article/google-search-monopoly-breakup-chrome-09b695c8de6c91b3d1e1b5305393f235,AP News,Michael Liedtke,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Google is confronting an existential threat as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into an illegal monopoly. The drama began to unfold Monday in a Washington courtroom as three weeks of hearings kicked off to determine how the company should be penalized for operating a monopoly in search. In its opening arguments, federal antitrust enforcers also urged the court to impose forward-looking remedies to prevent Google from using artificial intelligence to further its dominance. “This is a moment in time, we’re at an inflection point, will we abandon the search market and surrender them to control of the monopolists or will we let competition prevail and give choice to future generations,” said Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a “remedy hearing,” are set to feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. Google’s attorney, John Schmidtlein, said in his opening statement that the court should take a much lighter touch. He said the government’s heavy-handed proposed remedies wouldn’t boost competition but instead unfairly reward lesser rivals with inferior technology.  “Google won its place in the market fair and square,” Schmidtlein said. The moment of reckoning comes four-and-a-half-years after the Justice Department fileda landmark lawsuitalleging Google’s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet’s main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade. After the case finally went to trial in 2023,a federal judge last year ruledGoogle had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software. That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google’s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998. Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers. Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that — no matter what occurs — Google always wins,” the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. “The American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.” Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden’s term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google’s immense power as a threat to freedom, too. In his opening statement, Dahlquist noted that top officials from the Justice Department were in the room to watch proceedings. He said their presence indicated that the case had the full support of federal antitrust regulators, both past and present. “The fact that this case was filed in 2020, tried in 2023, under two different administrations, and joined by 49 states demonstrates the non-partisan nature of this case and our proposed remedies,” Dahlquist said. Dahlquist also said that Mehta would be hearing a lot about AI — “perhaps more than you want, your honor,” — and said top executives from AI companies, like ChatGPT, would be called to testify. He said the court’s remedies should include provisions to make sure that Google’s AI product, Gemini, isn’t used to strengthen its existing search monopoly. “We believe that Google can and will attempt to circumvent the court’s remedies if it is not included,” Dahlquist said. “Gen AI is Google’s next evolution to keep their vicious cycle spinning.” Schmidtlein, Google’s attorney, said rival AI companies had seen enormous growth in recent years and were doing “just fine.” Google is also sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. “The breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers,” Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. The showdown over Google’s fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals. The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup — a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court. Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta’s ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can’t do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day. The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social mediain another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against bothAppleandAmazon, too. The Justice Department also targeted Google’s digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week inanother federal judge’s decisionthat found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year. ___ Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",World News,1
Secondhand stores are poised to benefit if US tariffs drive up new clothing costs,https://apnews.com/article/secondhand-clothes-shoes-tariffs-prices-0d6de65d89435b96fc396e53a77381f5,AP News,Anne D’Innocenzio,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from PresidentDonald Trump’strade wareven asbusinesses the world overrace to avert potential damage, according to industry experts. American styles carry international influence, butnearly allof the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs “disproportionately affect” those goods. Such price hikes may drivecost-conscious shoppersto online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country. “I think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,” said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. “What I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.” The outlook for pre-owned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president’s tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It’s also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand. Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites. “Until I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can’t say exclusively that I’ll be pushed into another direction,” Genovese, 75, said. “I think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.” The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predictedafter the COVID-19 pandemicthat global revenue from pre-owned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in amore environmentally consciousway. While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower showsthe audience may be expanding. The number of mobile app downloads for nineresale marketplacesthe firm tracks — eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist,Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted — increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said. The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiledsince-paused punitive tariffson dozens of countries. Circana’s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusualvintage piecesto supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items. “It’s still a cheaper option” than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said. Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell pre-owned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said. Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will “pay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market” from the tariffs, Chandra said. Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said. “Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people’s closets or in warehouses not being used,” offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said. “There’s a huge amount of uncertainty,” Gittins said. “Everyone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone’s head is going.” Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains anddepartment storesbecause they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S. Still, resale vendors aren’t immune fromtariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry’s environmental impact. U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% dutyif Trump moves forwardwith instituting “reciprocal” tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said. A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trumpalready endedthe duty-free provision for low-value parcelsfrom China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by makinglow-priced Chinese fashionspricier, she said. James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the “de minimis” provision andthe 145% tariffTrump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands. “Brands will explore this and they may do more, but I don’t see them massively changing their operations,” Reinhart said. “I think they’re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don’t think resale helps you survive.” Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said. Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel’s 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said. “That has nothing to do with the tariffs,” he said. “Consumers are feeling priced out.” Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop. If tariffs upendthe economics of fast fashionand discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus. “I would love if this would steer people in a different direction,” she said.",World News,1
AP PHOTOS: Chile’s capital has the oldest hat maker in South America,https://apnews.com/article/hat-shop-museum-chile-photo-essay-dc918deef82adfc1131e447d038ea4ba,AP News,Nayara Batschke,14-04-25,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — Some 110 years have passed since the business began, but passersby, tourists, celebrities and even presidents still gravitate to this 19th-century mansion nestled in the heart of Santiago, Chile. Behind discreet gray doors, visitors find racks of hats — black bowlers, safari styles, top hats and close-fitting cloth caps once worn by troops. The musty store, called Where the Monkey Hits, is a surprising fashion hotspot in modern-day Chile given its tradition, claiming to be the oldest hat maker in South America. The shop sees the hat as much a relic of Chile’s past as it is an accessory. It recently reopened after a long restoration and now hosts a modest museum showcasing other 19th-century treasures like opulent chandeliers and neoclassical furniture. The artifacts tell the story of the imported European fashions of that era as immigrants crossed oceans to try their luck on the distant Pacific coast. Exhausted and full of hope, Spanish, Italian, French and German workers poured out of ships and trains, into the pulsing streets of a nascent Santiago. “It was like what our airports are today,” store owner Roberto Lasen, a third-generation Spanish immigrant, told The Associated Press, gesturing toward the capital’s main avenue, which has recently seen businesses shutter as consumers flock to shopping malls. “The entire flow of foreigners entered through this street.” A customer tries on a hat at “Donde Golpea el Monito” hat shop and museum, in Santiago, Chile, Friday, April 3, 2025, that preserves a hat-making tradition dating back to 1915.

These Easter eggs have been decorated by the Sorbian community for thousands of years,https://apnews.com/article/germany-sorbian-ethnic-minority-easter-eggs-da11da34f776f67c62480b56d9dce420,AP News,Stefanie Dazio,14-04-25,"SCHLEIFE, Germany (AP) — Anke Hanusch dips hertool into dark blue waxand dots it precisely on a yellow-dyed Easter egg in her hand. Back and forth, wax to egg, egg to wax, as the honeycomb pattern grows. The intricate motif means the egg will ultimately be a gift from a godparent to their godchild, to bestow diligence and a good work ethic upon the youngster. The tradition ofdecorating Easter eggsis part of the culture of the Slavic-speakingSorbian ethnic minorityin Germany. Modern-day Sorbs are descended from Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe who settled in Germany some 1,500 years ago. About 60,000 Sorbs currently live inGermany, split between the federal states of Saxony and Brandenburg.

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)  Hanusch wore the red folk costume and bonnet of an unmarried woman; married women wore green. She was among more than 30 artisans selling their Easter eggs at the cultural center. Her prices ranged from the cheapest decorated chicken egg for 7 euros ($7.72) up to 90 euros ($99.28) for a painted emu egg. The decorating can take between 90 minutes and six hours, depending on the techniques used, the motif and size of the egg. The artisans use a needle or the tip of a goose feather quill, cut in different ways, to draw the designs. The egg artisans said the worldwidebird fluoutbreak, and subsequentegg shortage and price hikes, have not yet affected their craft — though they added that it’s always best to get eggs directly from a farmer rather than a supermarket. Hanusch, who is Sorbian on her father’s side, is learning to speak the Slavic language. She said she and other Sorbian children start decorating Easter eggs as young as two, from when they can first hold a pencil. Many only do it during the Easter season throughout childhood, but Hanusch continued with the skill and became a teacher to others, including her niece. “I think it’s a valuable cultural asset that needs to be preserved,” she said. “It would be a shame if it were to become extinct.” Two women of Germany’s Slavic-speaking Sorbian ethnic minority, sits behind their desk to sell traditional Sorbian Easter Egg at a Easter Market in Schleife, Germany, Sunday, April 6, 2025.

Historic domes of Hagia Sophia are renovated to protect the landmark from earthquakes,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-mosque-hagia-sophia-renovation-7d7e424d325ea82129c17cfe993f7ee5,AP News,,14-04-25,"ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkey has begun a new phase in sweeping restorations of the nearly 1,500-year-oldHagia Sophiain Istanbul, focusing on preserving the monument’s historic domes from the threat of earthquakes. Officials say the project will include reinforcing Hagia Sophia’s main dome and half domes, replacing the worn lead coverings and upgrading the steel framework while worship continues uninterrupted in the mosque. A newly installed tower crane on the eastern façade is expected to facilitate the efforts by transporting materials, expediting the renovations. “We have been carrying out intensive restoration efforts on Hagia Sophia and its surrounding structures for three years,” said Dr. Mehmet Selim Okten, a construction engineer, lecturer at Mimar Sinan University and a member of the scientific council overseeing the renovations. “At the end of these three years, we have focused on the seismic safety of Hagia Sophia, the minarets, the main dome and the main arches, especially due to the expected Istanbul earthquake.” In 2023, a7.8 magnitude earthquakestruck southern Turkey, destroying or damaging hundreds of thousands of buildings and leaving more than 53,000 people dead. While Istanbul was not impacted, the devastation in southern Turkey heightened fears of a similar quake with experts citing the city’s proximity to fault lines. Okten said a “new phase” of work is about to begin, one that he describes as the most significant intervention in over 150 years and in the totality of the structure’s long history.  “A tower crane will be installed on the eastern facade, and then we will cover the top of this unique structure with a protective frame system,” he said. “That way, we can work more safely and examine the building’s layers academically, including damage it suffered from fires and earthquakes in the 10th and 14th centuries.” Built by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian in 537, Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque with the 1453 Ottoman conquest of Istanbul. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founding leader of the Turkish republic, converted it into a museum in 1934. Although an annex to Hagia Sophia, the sultan’s pavilion, has been open to prayers since the 1990s, religious and nationalist groups in Turkey had long yearned for the nearly 1,500-year-old edifice they regard as the legacy of Ottoman Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror to be reverted into a mosque. Turkey’s highest administrative court overturned the 1934 decree in 2020, allowing it toreopen as a mosque. “We have completed our work on the four minarets and the main structure,” Okten said. “But for this unique cultural heritage (of the domes), we plan to use modern, lightweight materials and keep the building open to the public.” Visitors to the site expressed approval of the plan. “Hagia Sophia is amazing, it’s one of the world’s most important monuments,” said Cambridge University lecturer Rupert Wegerif. “It seems really important that they are going to strengthen it in case of earthquakes and preserve it.” Okten said that while it wasn’t clear when the renovations will be finished, the process would be open to the public to be “monitored transparently.”",World News,1
"Southeast Asia water festivals begin, but earthquake recovery blunts Myanmar’s celebrations",https://apnews.com/article/myanmar-thailand-cambodia-laos-water-festival-holiday-3ca51bb17fcdaa222245331f94acdd8b,AP News,,13-04-25,"BANGKOK (AP) — Several Southeast Asian countries kicked off their annual water festival holiday on Sunday, but in the wake of adevastating earthquakelast month,Myanmaris missing out on the fun. The holiday is an occasion for merrymaking during what is usually the hottest time of the year. In Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, millions normally take part in a mix of raucous play with uninhibited splashing of water on friends and strangers alike, and sober ceremonies to show respect to one’s elders. Temperatures this time of year can creep above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Many who have moved to cities for work return to their native villages and towns to reunite with their families. The celebration is normally spread over several days, culminating on the actual New Year’s Day. In Myanmar, the holiday is called Thingyan. But this year, the country is struggling to recover from the 7.7 magnitude earthquake on March 28 that devastated its central heartland, killing more than 3,600 people and leveling structures from new condos toancient pagodas. Central Myanmar was shaken again on Sunday by a5.5 magnitude earthquakein one of the biggest aftershocks since the March 28 temblor. Even before last month’s quake, Myanmar was reeling from a repressive military that seized power in 2021 and is carrying outa brutal waron the pro-democracy forces trying to unseat it. In 2020, the pandemic also quashed celebrations.  Still, the holiday offered a brief respite from the grim struggles of daily life in one of the region’s poorer countries, and this is the first year Myanmar could celebrate Thingyan’s inclusion on the UNESCO Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, an honor attained last December. A few days after the quake, themilitary governmentannounced that this year’s festival would be observed peacefully in pursuit of traditional culture and would not include joyous singing and dancing, due to a nationwide grieving period. People are free to celebrate privately and quietly, and items related to the festival, including water guns, are being sold in malls and stores. However, there is no government-organized entertainment. In Yangon, the country’s largest city, major festival pavilions and decorations that were already being built in front of the City Hall were dismantled. People’s Square, a major celebration spot in Yangon, will not host the festival this year, but a traditional charity feast will be held without music and dance, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported on Thursday. In Yangon, the downtown area near City Hall was quiet, in sharp contrast to many past occasions. The only visible signs of the holiday were the sights of children playing with water in the streets of residential neighborhoods, and mostly elderly people going to Buddhist monasteries and pagodas for traditional prayers. In the capital, Naypyitaw, state-media reported Saturday that a quiet celebration of the holiday’s recognition by UNESCO would include events such as applying Thanaka, a yellowish-white paste made from ground tree bark as a traditional natural cosmetic, gently washing the heads and cutting the nails of elderly people as a gesture of respect, and donating food. Neighboring Thailand, where the holiday is called Songkran, was expected to celebrate with revelry as usual. It sees a mass exodus of the workforce in the capital, Bangkok, return to their upcountry home towns, often extending what is officially a three-day holiday into an entire working week. Foreign tourists join locals in almost orgiastic water fights, especially in Bangkok’s Khao San Road backpackers district. Water pistols are merely small arms. It is not unusual to see huge buckets of water dumped on any convenient target. Moving vehicles serve as both platforms and targets for attacks. The holiday is historically pegged to a seasonal movement of the sun, critical to largely agrarian societies. The water hijinks originated in olden days as a ceremony to welcome rainy season. A traditional ritual still practiced by many involves cleansing images of the Buddha and washing the hands and feet of elders. There is a darker side to the goings-on, as well. Thailand already has one of the world’s highest rates of traffic fatalities, which spikes during Songkran with so many on the move and often inebriated. Cambodia, where the holiday is called Choul Chnam Thmey, and Laos, where it is Pi Mai Lao, have similar celebrations, generally smaller in scale and less raucous than those in Thailand. ——- Associated Press writer Sopheng Cheang in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, contributed to this report.",World News,1

At their own pace, each person is carried away by the music — and no one seems surprised by the moves of others. From experimental jazz pieces and smooth Egyptian hip-hop to the more familiar pulse of cumbias grooved with an electronic touch, people dance to it all. The party was organized by the Nueva Red de Bailadores or NRB (New Network of Dancers), a collective that aims to create spaces where people can gather to dance freely. There’s no cover charge, no booze, and no pressure to do the “right” moves.

(AP Photo/Ginnette Riquelme)     The collective began nine years ago as a simple gathering of friends dancing freely in an apartment. As word spread, their numbers swelled from 20 to 50, then more than 100 — so they had to move to a park. “The New Network of Dancers is (a community) of philosophy and action,” said Martínez. “Dancing alone is very fulfilling, but dancing with a lot of people is also very enriching.” As their numbers grew, the NRB approached the authorities and established a relationship with the agency responsible for preserving Mexico City’s historic center and with museum directors, who agreed to provide sound equipment and other resources for the events. Building on its network of contacts, it has organized some 300 dancing sessions in ever more striking and unexpected spaces, such as old factories and gardens. The latest NRB party featured two dance floors — one inside and one outside the pavilion — both areas filled with joy and lightness. As organizers pointed out, their parties forgo police and security, fostering a sense of collective care where attendees look out for one another. “Being able to come to a space where you feel happiness and respect ... it gives you peace of mind,” said Ana Celia Agustín, 29, a regular at NRB dances. A key to the collective’s success comes from having become a real social network, and what NRB member Elías Herrera describes as a “virtuous circle” between online and in-person interaction that the collective has unleashed. While social media videos and posts have played a role in promoting the dance parties, word-of-mouth has been key to make them so popular. “I knew a lot about dancing and my body always mixed it with alcohol,” said Mateo Cruz, 27. “Here I found a new place. It’s been an eye-opening experience for me to discover that I have all this stuff inside me that I can let go of. I can completely free myself from what others think, from what I think myself.” Ivette Vallejo López, 45, dances in her wheelchair at the Chapultepec Scenic Garden during a cost-free, harassment-free, judgment-free event by the New Network of Dancers collective or NRB, in Mexico City, Sunday, March 16, 2025.

(AP Photo/Ginnette Riquelme)   The Mexican capital is a city that dances, especially in its most popular neighborhoods, where public space is often turned into a dance floor for market anniversaries,patron saint celebrationsor simply the joy of weekend cumbias. Generally, however, these parties feature a more homogenous crowd and musical selection. In contrast, the NRB dances have opened the dance floor to a more diverse audience and invites everyone on a shape-shifting musical journey. Isabel Miraflores, a 73-year-old retired high school assistant principal, came with her husband and said she enjoyed both the dancing and the presence of people of different ages. “I think it’s wonderful because it’s a free event,” she said. “We get together with people from all parts of society and we have fun without any trouble.” The sun has set, it’s almost 7 p.m., and there is just over one hour left before the dance ends, but dozens are still waiting in line to enter the pavilion in the famed Bosque de Chapultepec, an urban park that stretches across more than 2,000 acres in the heart of Mexico City. “In a capitalist reality like ours, it’s very difficult to find an alternative, especially one that is free,” said Martínez. “Accessibility is everything for us.” ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean athttps://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",World News,1
Assisted living isn’t just for people. A zoo in Spain helps elderly elephants age gracefully,https://apnews.com/article/elephants-aging-zoo-barcelona-spain-e44ce04d14a4a148e77570281bbeac51,AP News,,13-04-25,"Lee esta historia en español BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — At theBarcelonaZoo, a 40-year-oldAfrican elephantplaces her foot through the metal barrier where a zookeeper gently scrubs its sole — the beloved pachyderm gets her “pedicure,” along with apple slices every day. The treatment is part of the zoo’s specialized geriatric care for aging animals that cannot be reintroduced into the wild as zoos world over increasingly emphasize lifelong care. “Sending them back into nature would be an error,” said Pilar Padilla, head of the zoo’s mammal care. “It is very likely they wouldn’t survive.” Zoos have undergone a rethink in recent decades with the emphasis on the conservation of species and education, moving away from the past paradigm that often displayed exotic animals as a spectacle. The new approach includes knowing how to adapt to the needs of aging animals, which has led zoos to create bigger, more nature-like enclosures, such as the Sahel-Savannah area at the zoo in the Spanish city of Barcelona. Along with breeding programs to reintroduce fit animals into nature, zoos today want to ensure that animals living longer due to advancements in veterinary care can age gracefully, said Martín Zordan, the CEO of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, or WAZA. “Specialized geriatric care is becoming increasingly essential,” Zordan told The Associated Press at the organization’s Barcelona offices.  Zordan said that just like older people, elderly animals require more care: regular health checks, arthritis treatment, softer foods or nutritional supplements, adapted living spaces and monitoring of mental and behavioral health.

(AP Photo/Hernan Muñoz)  Along with caring for a pair of aging elephants, the Barcelona Zoo is also the home for a 15-year-old wolf, a leopard and a tiger who are both 17, as well as some older birds — including a flock of senior flamencos. It’s not alone — several zoos in the United States, for example, highlight their treatment of older animals, such as the zoos in Baltimore and Baton Rouge.   Zookeepers at the Barcelona Zoo, not far from the city’s Mediterranean coastline, are closely monitoring its two aging female pachyderms, Susi and Bully (pronounced BUH'-yi), as they cope with the recent death of Yoyo, their former pen-mate and long-time companion. Yoyo died in December at age 54. Susi, at 52, is now among the oldest known African elephants in captivity, even though WAZA said the age ofanimals born in the wildis approximate. Bully, who is 40, is also considered old for an African elephant. All three were captured in the wild and spent time in circuses an other zoos before coming to Barcelona. An old African elephant named Bully stands inside the Barcelona Zoo in, Spain, Thursday, March 27, 2025. (AP Photo/Hernan Muñoz)  The zoo is now working with the University of Barcelona to study the impact of Yoyo’s death on Susi and Bully. It’s the first study of its kind, focused on elephants not from the same family after the death of a long-time companion, Padilla told The Associated Press during a recent visit to the zoo’s elephant enclosure. At first, Susi and Bully showed their shock by not eating, but are now adapting well and turning to one another, including even sharing food, Padilla said, adding that Susi has taken on the dominant role that Yoyo had.   For elephants, their teeth are the real age test. “What marks the decline of the animal is the wear on their teeth,” Barcelona zookeeper José María Santamaría said after finishing the Bully’s pedicure. “They go through six sets of molars during their life, and when they reach around 40 years old they lose the last set.” Susi and Bully require daily checkups, food suited for their now molar-less mouths and extra attention to their legs — hence the daily pedicures and the enclosure’s soft sandy floor to cushion aching feet. “Those are the sort of considerations taken because we care about these animals living comfortably and leading lives with dignity,” Zordan said.",World News,1
Vultures are among the least loved animals. African conservationists are trying to change that,https://apnews.com/article/vulture-conservation-environment-wildlife-africa-d4d01206834873a198c6883bc92936f4,AP News,,12-04-25,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Vultures have an image problem. Seen as ugly and associated with death, they are among the least loved animals in the world. But conservationists in Africa are trying to change that. They’ve launched an effort tosave endangered vulturesby trying to put a dollar figure on their incredible value. A recent report by the BirdLife International conservation organization estimated that vultures are worth $1.8 billion a year to certain ecosystems in southern Africa, which might surprise anyone not familiar with the clean-up, pest control and anti-poaching work performed by one of the most efficient scavengers on the planet. “They are not up there on the pretty scale. And they are not popular. But we know they are very useful,” said Fadzai Matsvimbo, an extinction prevention coordinator at BirdLife International. The report comes at an important time for Africa’s vultures; six of the 11 species found on the continent are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which says vultures arehighly threatened in many parts of the world. In Africa, some species have declined by nearly 90%, Matsvimbo said. Conservationists hope the report will make authorities and the publicmore aware of the positive impactof vultures. It focused on research in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe and shows how a wake of vultures — the term for a group of feeding vultures — can strip a decomposing carcass in hours, cleaning up ecosystems, reducing the chance of disease spreading and the presence of pests like rats and feral dogs, which has great benefits to communities.  Vultures also have extremely strong stomach acid, don’t get food poisoning and are able to consume and neutralize anthrax, botulism and other bacteria and toxins in carcasses that would kill other animals, removing deadly threats from the environment. Just this week, more than 50 hippos died from suspected anthrax poisoning in a reserve in Congo. Vultures are nature’s “best sanitation services,” said Matsvimbo. Conservationists have raised the case of the drastic loss of vultures in India over the last 30 years and how that led to a health crisis. A study published last year said half a million people died in India because of the spread of bacteria and infections in the absence of vultures. Matsvimbo said vultures in Africa are also used as “sentinels” by game rangers because they are often the first to spot a dead animal and can lead rangers to where poachers might be active. They have even proven useful in helping farmers locate dead or injured livestock. Vultures are uniqueamong land vertebrates in that they only feed on carrion — dead animals. That makes them especially susceptible to poisoning by humans, either intentionally by poachers and others who want to get rid of them, or by mistake when pests are the target. Hundreds of vultures can die from a single poisoned carcass. Vultures are also regularly killed or maimed in collisions with powerlines in Africa. And they are increasingly being killed for belief-based reasons, said Kerri Wolter, the CEO of the Vulpro vulture rehabilitation center in South Africa, which treats sick and injured vultures to be released back into the wild. She said because vultures have such outstanding eyesight and instincts when it comes to finding a dead animal they are viewed by some as being clairvoyant and able to foresee death. Their body parts, and especially their head, are used in potions or as charms to predict the future. “Our work is to change the mindsets of people,” Wolter said. “For them to see vultures and think, wow that is amazing.” Matsvimbo and Wolter both said vultures have been given a raw deal by moviemakers in Hollywood, where they are almost always shown as evil and sinister. Movies have done for vultures what “Jaws” did for sharks, Wolter said. “I love watching ‘The Lion King,’ but every time they do the vulture part, my heart breaks,” said Matsvimbo. “Vultures are never portrayed in a positive way. I have a bone to chew with these moviemakers. Or should that be bone to pick?” ___ AP Africa news:https://apnews.com/hub/africa",World News,1

(AP video by Daniel Niemann) The humble “Wasserhäuschen,” or little water houses, have been a distinctive feature of the city since they started springing up in the second half of the 19th century. Back when drinking unboiled tap water wasn’t advisable, the little kiosks offered bottles of mineral water. They encouraged workers, with the city’s approval, to drink affordable water rather than beer and schnapps.

City authorities say there are now about 300, most of them leased by breweries or distributors of drinks to their operators.

Theofficialsincluded Justice Secretary Paul Lam, security office director Dong Jingwei and former police commissioner Raymond Siu. In a retaliatory move against Washington, D.C., on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun in Beijing said China strongly condemned the acts, calling them “despicable.” The U.S. has seriously interfered in the affairs of Hong Kong and violated international law principles, he said “China has decided to impose sanctions on U.S. congressmen, officials, and NGO leaders who have performed poorly on Hong Kong-related issues,” Guo said, adding the response was made according to the anti-foreign sanctions law. He did not provide more details about who is being targeted. Guo also issued a warning about Hong Kong, saying the southern Chinese city’s affairs are not subject to U.S. interference. Any actions considered wrong by the Chinese government that are taken on Hong Kong-related issues will be met with firm countermeasures and reciprocal retaliation, he said.  The tit-for-tat sanctions over Hong Kong’s human rights issues are the latest sign of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, which are already locked ina trade warthat has rattled businesses on both sides. Beijing separately warned other countries on Monday against making trade deals with the U.S. to China’s detriment.

Vance and Modi are likely to discuss a potential US-India trade deal. Here’s what to know,https://apnews.com/article/india-us-vance-visit-modi-trade-deal-101ffd4c524469c691fd7d1fd7da2ea0,AP News,Sheikh Saaliq,21-04-25,"NEW DELHI (AP) — U.S. Vice President JD Vance began a four-dayvisit to Indiaon Monday as the two countries seek to unlock economic opportunities and negotiate a bilateral trade deal. Vance will meet Prime MinisterNarendra Modiin New Delhi for talks on the economy, trade and geopolitical ties. Vance’s visit is seen as an important diplomatic mission by President Donald Trump’s administration, and it coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi’s main rival in the region. A trade deal between India and the U.S. could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties. The U.S. is also India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion until recently. India’s Foreign Ministry has said the visit will “provide an opportunity for both sides to review the progress in bilateral relations” and the two leaders will “exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.” Here’s what to know about Vance’s visit: Vance’s arrival in India comes weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was in India for ageopolitical conferenceand two months after Modi met Trump in Washington. Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. Duringhis visit, Modi hailed a “mega partnership” with the U.S. and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump’s tariffs after it had already cut tariffs on a range of U.S. goods.  Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy as part of his now-paused tariff program, which has provided temporary relief for Indian exporters. During his visit, Modi sought to soften impending trade barriers by saying he was open to reducing more tariffs on U.S. goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military gear. The two countries also agreed to start talks toward clinching the bilateral trade agreement. Modi on Friday said he spoke with Elon Musk, noting that he and the SpaceX CEO “discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation,” adding “India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the U.S. in these domains.” India is a close partner of the U.S. for bilateral trade, foreign direct investments, defense cooperation and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region. It is also part of the Quad, which is made up of the United States, India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China’s expansion in the region. Leading U.S. companies such as Apple Inc. and Google have expanded operations in India in recent years. Last month, Musk’s Starlinkentered into agreementswith two of India’s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services. To further boost trade ties, the U.S. and India have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 under the expected trade deal agreement. The negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors. This poses a significant challenge for Modi’s government as it hopes to improve the country’s economy and generate jobs with an export-led recovery. Modi established a goodworking relationshipwith Trump during his first term in office. It now appears that the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries, particularly in trade. Chinese President Xi Jinping is aiming to position Beijing as a reliable trade partner in the Asia-Pacific region amid rising tensions with Washington. India has also already taken a number of steps to win over Trump. It will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment, including the fifth-generation stealth fighter jets, from the U.S. The U.S., however, wants greater market access for its agricultural and dairy products in India, but New Delhi has been reluctant so far as the farm sector employs the bulk of the country’s workforce. Vance’s visit to India marks his first official trip to the country, which has added significance for the second family. His wifeUsha Vance— a practicing Hindu — is the daughter of immigrants from South India. In his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance described his wife as a “supersmart daughter of Indian immigrants” whom he met at Yale Law School. Usha’s parents moved to the U.S. in the late 1970s. Vance will be accompanied by Usha, their children and other senior members of the U.S. administration, and the couple will visit the Indian cities of Jaipur and Agra and participate in engagements at cultural sites, a readout from the White House said.",World News,1

Vance, who is on a largely personalfour-day visitto India, met with Modi at his residence in New Delhi and the two leaders “reviewed and positively assessed the progress in various areas of bilateral cooperation,” Modi’s office said in a statement. They also “welcomed the significant progress” in the negotiations of an expected trade deal between the two countries, the statement said. The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aiming to seal a bilateral trade agreement this year. They have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well. The deal “presents an opportunity to negotiate a new and modern trade agreement focused on promoting job creation and citizen well-being in both countries, with the goal of enhancing bilateral trade and supply-chain integration in a balanced and mutually beneficial manner,” Vance’s office said in a statement. Vance’s first visit to New Delhi came amid the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump’snow-paused tariff programagainst most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between the United States and China, which is New Delhi’s main rival in the region. AP correspondent Jennifer King reports Vice President JD Vance is on a personal and diplomatic trip to India.  Modi’s office said that the two leaders “noted continued efforts towards enhancing cooperation in energy, defense, strategic technologies and other areas” and “exchanged views on various regional and global issues of mutual interest, and called for dialogue and diplomacy as the way forward.” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Monday that Vance’s visit will “further deepen the India–U.S. comprehensive global strategic partnership.” Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi’s Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome, wherehe met with Pope Francison Easter Sunday, a day before the pontiff’s death. Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their three children and officials from the U.S. administration. The family visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort — a UNESCO world heritage site — during their trip. India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region. It was also part of the Quad, which is made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China’s expansion in the region. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year. Washington has long sought to develop a deeper partnership with New Delhi, which is seen as a bulwark against China. Modi particularly established a goodworking relationshipwith Trump during his first term in office, and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries. Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. Duringhis visit, he hailed a “mega partnership” with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump’s tariffs. The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration’s demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S. Modi also has cooperated with Trump’s moves to deport migrants as India has accepted many of its citizens from the U.S. in the past few months. Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a “tariff abuser” and “tariff king.” The trade negotiations are especially urgent for India, which could be hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors. Harsh Vardhan Shringla, India’s former foreign secretary and ambassador to the U.S., said that Vance’s visit comes at a time of global upheaval in world trade. He said ties between New Delhi and Washington could see an upsurge under Trump’s presidency, mainly in technology-sharing and defense. “U.S. trade policy under Trump offers an opportunity for India to embed itself in a bigger way in the U.S. markets and global supply chains,” Shringla said. Modi’s government is also hoping to attract investment from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Last month, Musk’s Starlinkentered into agreementswith two of India’s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services. Musk also indicated that he would visit India later this year after speaking last week with Modi, signaling that there could be progress in the electric carmaker’s push to enter the Indian market. India is also a major defense partner of the U.S. It has in recent years embedded advanced American jets, helicopters, missiles and military gear into its armed forces. The two countries have announced plans to sign a 10-year framework later this year for strengthening their defense partnership. ___ Rajesh Roy contributed to this report.",World News,1
Thai-Chinese company denies flouting safety measures in probe of skyscraper collapse following quake,https://apnews.com/article/thailand-china-building-collapse-investigation-earthquake-myanmar-a847dc6f551d8846520dea7525a4f5a7,AP News,Jintamas Saksornchai,21-04-25,"BANGKOK (AP) — A Thai-Chinese company denied Monday allegations its steel rods did not passsafety standard testsafter nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok. Authorities are probing Xin Ke Yuan Steel and another Chinese contractor involved in the construction to find out why the building crumbled following a quake centered in Myanmar, more than 800 miles (1,200 kilometers) away. It was the only building that completely collapsed that day. The 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28killed more than 3,700 in Myanmar, while in Thailand, 47 were killed, mostly at the collapse site, and 47 others went missing. The collapsesparked questions about the enforcement of construction safety and the state-run Chinese contractor, China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, leading to the arrest Saturday of its Chinese executive in Thailand, identified as Zhang, on suspicion of operating the business through the use of nominees. Foreigners can operate a business in Thailand, but it must be a joint venture with a Thai partner, and they cannot own more than 49% to protect local competitiveness. Three Thai shareholders of the company are also wanted on suspicion of being the nominees, said officials of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand’s equivalent of the FBI. They also said they were looking into the quality of the construction material and whether the company illegally fixed its bidding.  The company posted a video online last year advertising the building, meant to be a new office of the State Audit Office, with plenty of drone footage and boasting about the quality of the design, construction and management of the project. Last week, a Thai engineer filed a police complaint saying that his name and signature were forged as a project controller in one of the construction plans. He denied any involvement in the project. Xin Ke Yuan Steel, also partly owned by Chinese nationals, came under scrutiny over the quality of the steel rods they provided for the buildings. Its operating license is currently suspended following a fatal fire accident in December at its factory in Rayong province. Industry Minister Akanat Promphan said two types of steel rods found at the collapse site did not pass safety standards and that Xin Ke Yuan supplied both. He raided the company’s factory on April 11 for evidence, saying that samples of the steel products confiscated by authorities following its December suspension have already failed two tests. The company’s legal team disputed Monday the test results in a press conference, stressing that all of their products had passed safety tests and that they were being treated unfairly by authorities. They, however, declined to comment when asked specifically about the test results of the company’s steel rods found at the collapse site.

Virginia Democrats reap fundraising gains as they center campaigns around Elon Musk,https://apnews.com/article/virginia-elections-donors-report-elon-musk-8ee4a569bc5a043cbd21f3d8c2d4f0fe,AP News,Olivia Diaz,21-04-25,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Virginia Democrats vying to shield their statehouse majority and flip the governor’s mansion in November raised millions of dollars more than Republicans in the first three months of 2025, according to newly released campaign finance reports, securing a cash advantage in their pursuit of voters frustrated with Republican tech billionaire Elon Musk. For months, Democrats have tailored their campaigns around anti-Musk sentiment in Virginia, pushing ads blasting his initiative to overhaul federal spending during President Donald Trump’s administration. And campaign finance reports released on Tuesday suggest their strategy may be helping their cash flow: Former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger raised $6.7 milliontoward her campaign for governorbetween January and March, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Democrats also raised more than $3.7 million during those months towardthe House of Delegates elections, in which all seats of the lower chamber are on the ballot. Del. Dan Helmer, the House Democrats’ campaigns chair, said following the reports’ publication that the GOP “agenda is out of step with Virginians, and no last-minute attempt to distance themselves from President Trump and Elon Musk will save them.” Republicans raised roughly $2.2 million less than Democrats in the House races, according to VPAP. Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears’ gubernatorial campaign brought home a little over $3.1 million, though, unlike Spanberger, she was unable to raise money during Virginia’s 45-day legislative session.  In a statement, a spokesperson for Earle-Sears’ campaign said: “We’ll have the resources we need to share Winsome’s story and take the case directly to voters — and that includes holding Abigail Spanberger accountable for her failures in Washington. This is just the beginning.” The first-quarter financial reports reflect the national attention — and money — pouring into Virginia’s off-year races.The state has been acutely impactedby Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency because it’s where many federal workers live. Changes to the federal government have already sparked frustrations among Virginians, who have decried the changes during town halls and community meetings. “Virginia elections are often about angry voters, and the most angry group of voters is the party who lost the White House the year before,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington. “Democrats are angry, and they’re putting their money where their irritation is.” Behind some donations aremultimillionaires and billionaires backing Spanberger, such $100,000 from venture capitalist and LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman. CEO Martha Samuelson gave another $100,000. Spanberger’s largest donors so far this year were two political action committees: $500,000 from VoteVets Federal PAC and $250,000 from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Working Families Fund. Earle-Sears’largest donation of $300,000came from Florida-based billionaire Thomas Peterffy. Former U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy also contributed $50,000 to the lieutenant governor’s coffers, and a political group affiliated with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley also chipped in $5,000. Among the slew of Earle-Sears’ conservative donors, there is one person notably missing: Musk himself. Musk and his affiliated groups have not yet contributed to Virginia’s elections, according to a list of donors provided by VPAP. His absence comes after he and those groupssunk $21 millioninto flipping theWisconsin Supreme Courtto conservative control in early April, only to see his candidate lose by 10 percentage points. “One of the big questions about the Virginia election this year is whether Elon Musk will weigh in like he did in the Wisconsin Supreme Court election recently,” Farnsworth said, later adding: “The question really is whether Musk will view Virginia as a good investment.” ___ This story was first published on Apr. 17, 2025.

White House voices support for Hegseth as a new Signal chat revelation stirs fresh Pentagon turmoil,https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-signal-chat-pentagon-trump-30dc4c3d0e75a89f3fd883f38b26afff,AP News,Tara Copp,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House expressed support Monday forDefense Secretary Pete Hegsethfollowing media reports that he shared sensitive military details inanother Signal messaging chat, this time with his wife and brother. Neither the White House nor Hegseth denied that he had shared such information in a second chat, instead focusing their responses on what they called the disgruntled workers whom theyblamed for leaking to the mediaand insisting that noclassified informationhad been disclosed. “It’s just fake news. They just bring up stories,” President Donald Trump told reporters. “I guess it sounds like disgruntled employees. You know, he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people, and that’s what he’s doing. So you don’t always have friends when you do that,” Trump said. The administration’s posture was meant to hold the line against Democratic demands for Hegseth’s firing at a time when the Pentagon is engulfed in turmoil, including thedepartures of several senior aidesandan internal investigationover information leaks. The White House also tried to deflect attention from the national security implications of the latest Signal revelation by framing it as the outgrowth of an institutional power struggle between Hegseth and the career workforce. But some of therecently departed officialsthe administration appeared to dismiss as disgruntled were part of Hegseth’s initial inner circle, brought in when he took the job. “This is what happens when the entire Pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in remarks amplified by a Pentagon social media account.  The latest news added to questions about the judgment of the embattled Pentagon chief, coming on top of last month’s disclosure of his participation in aSignal chat with top Trump administration leadersin which details about the military airstrike against Yemen’s Houthi militants were shared. “Pete Hegseth must be fired,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. The New York Times reported Sunday that the information shared in a Signal messaging chat with Hegseth’s wife, brother and others was similar to what was communicated in the already disclosed chain with Trump administration officials. A person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, confirmed the second chat to The Associated Press. The person said it included 13 people and was dubbed “Defense ' Team Huddle.” White House officials first learned of the second Signal chat from news reports Sunday, according to an official familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. Hegseth, talking to reporters while attending theWhite House Easter Egg Roll, didn’t address the substance of the allegations or the national security implications they raised but assailed the media. “They take anonymous sources from disgruntled former employees and then they try to slash and burn people and ruin their reputations,” Hegseth said. “Not going to work with me. Because we’re changing the Defense Department, putting the Pentagon back in the hands of warfighters. And anonymous smears from disgruntled former employees on old news doesn’t matter.” Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, struck a similar tone,writing on Sunday night on X: “Secretary Hegseth is busy implementing President Trump’s America First agenda, while these leakers are trying to undermine them both. Shameful.” The Trump administration has struggled in its public explanations about senior officials’ use of Signal, acommercially available appnot authorized to be used to communicate sensitive or classified national defense information. The first chat, set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, included a number of Cabinet members andcame to light because Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the group. Officials have repeatedly insisted that the information shared on Signal was not classified, though the contents of that chat, which The Atlantic published, shows that Hegseth listed weapons systems and a timeline for theattack on the Iran-backed Houthislast month. Multiple current and former military officials say launch times and munitions drop times are classified information and putting those details on an unsecured channel could have put those pilots at risk. The Trump administration has faced criticism forfailing to take actionso far against top national security officials who discussed plans for the strike in Signal, and the latest report fueled additional calls for Hegseth’s ouster. “The details keep coming out. We keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk. But Trump is still too weak to fire him,” Schumerposted Sunday on X. The New York Times reported that the group in the second chat included Hegseth’s wife, Jennifer, who is a former Fox News producer, and his brotherPhil Hegseth, who was hired at the Pentagonas a Department of Homeland Security liaison and senior adviser. The Times said the second chat had the same warplane launch times that the first chat included. Hegseth’s Signal use is underinvestigation by the Defense Department’s acting inspector generalat the request of the bipartisan leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The senior Democratic member, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, urged the watchdog Sunday to look into the reported second chat as well. The Pentagon has confronted a wave of turbulence stretching beyond Signal. Defense officials have faced scrutiny over a seemingly haphazard and disjointedcampaign to purge online contentthat promoted women and minorities, in some casesscrambling to restore postsafter their removals came to light. Over the past week, five officials in Hegseth’s inner circle have departed. Dan Caldwell, a Hegseth aide; Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg; and Darin Selnick, Hegseth’s deputy chief of staff;were escorted out of the Pentagonas the department hunts down leaks of inside information. While those three initially had been placed on leave pending the investigation, ajoint statement shared by Caldwellon X on Saturday said they “still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with.” Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot announced he was resigning last week, unrelated to the leaks. The Pentagon said, however, that Ullyot was asked to resign. A fifth close Hegseth aide, chief of staff Joe Kasper, also was leaving, according to two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters. They didn’t say why. Caldwell and Selnick had worked with the defense secretary during his time leading the nonprofit Concerned Veterans for America. Kasper was the one who sent a March memo saying the Pentagon was investigating what it calledleaks of national security informationand that Defense Department personnel could face polygraphs. ___ Associated Press writers Chris Megerian and Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",Politics,1

Welcome to this week’s edition of AP Ground Game. Policy changes, but facts endure. AP delivers accurate, fact-based journalism to keep the world informed in every administration. Support independent reporting today.Donate. THE HEADLINES President Donald Trump gestures to reporters as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Sunday. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Trump team tries to project confidence and calm after tariff moves While his team was out defending his proposals on Sunday, Trump said on his social media platform that there ultimately will be no exemptions for his sweeping tariff agenda, disputing characterizations that he has granted tariff exceptions for certain electronics, including smartphones, whose production is concentrated in China.  Rather, Trump said, “those products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’”  A week ago, Trump’s team stood by his promise to leave the impending tariffs in place without exceptions. They used their latest news show appearances to defend his move to ratchet back to a 10% universal tariff for most nations except China (145%), while seeming to grant exemptions for certain electronics like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and semiconductor chips.  Last week on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick played up national security. “You’ve got to realize this is a national security issue,” he said, raising the worst-case scenarios of what could happen if the U.S. were involved in a war.  On Sunday, Lutnick stuck to that national security framing, but White House trade adviser Peter Navarro focused more on the import taxes being leverage in the bigger economic puzzle.  “The world cheats us. They’ve been cheating us for decades,” Navarro said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” He cited practices such as dumping products at unfairly low prices, currency manipulation and barriers to U.S. auto and agricultural products entering foreign markets.Read more. Of note: With the higher rates set to be collected beginning April 9, administration officials argued last week that other countries would rush to the negotiating table. On Sunday, Navarro named the United Kingdom, the European Union, India, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia and Israel as among the nations in active negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick and other officials. Greer said on CBS that his goal was “to get meaningful deals before 90 days” – the duration of Trump’s pause – “and I think we’re going to be there with several countries in the next few weeks.” Related reads➤ Thune's 'old fashioned' approach to Senate has kept Trump on board so far The Senate, once again, was working into the early morning hours Friday with its new majority leader, Republican John Thune, setting the pace.  It wasn’t until just after 2 a.m. that the last of the senators had straggled into the chamber to cast their vote on the confirmation of retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Dan “Razin” Caine for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The vote capped a grinding start to the year for the Senate that included several all-night floor sessions and — importantly for Thune — the quickest top-level Cabinet confirmation process in the past 20 years.  At the outset, however, such an outcome was far from assured. Trump was making demands that the new Senate leader be ready to put the chamber into recess so he could skip over the Senate confirmation process altogether. Faced with that prospect, Thune said his message in conversations with the president was, “Let us do this the old-fashioned way and just use the clock and grind it out, and then we’ll see where we go from there.”Read more. Of note: That approach has been successful so far, allowing the South Dakota Republican to show Trump the Senate’s worth while also preserving its constitutional role in installing a president’s Cabinet. Related reads➤ What might El Salvador’s Bukele get by visiting Trump? Trump is hosting El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a lynchpin of the U.S. administration's mass deportation operation.  Since March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. More than 200 Venezuelan immigrants – whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country's notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It is also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so.  That has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country’s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported.Read more. Of note: Since Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit in February, Bukele — whose government has arrested more than 84,000 people as part of his three-year crackdown on gangs — has made it clear he’s ready to help the Trump administration with its deportation ambitions.  Bukele struck a deal under which the U.S. will pay about $6 million for El Salvador to imprison the Venezuelan immigrants for a year. When a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to turn around a flight carrying the immigrants already en route to El Salvador, Bukele wrote on social media: “Oopsie ... too late.""

"60,000 Americans to lose their rental assistance and risk eviction unless Congress acts",https://apnews.com/article/trump-congress-housing-voucher-assistance-funding-cuts-26f9a716af6731e3c6445015488bab3a,AP News,Jesse Bedayn,21-04-25,"Moments after Daniris Espinal walked into her new apartment in Brooklyn, she prayed. In ensuing nights, she would awaken and touch the walls for reassurance — finding in them a relief that turned to tears over her morning coffee. Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both. But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money — and quickly. Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent. It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people — after several years of rebuilding their lives — back onto the street or back into abusive relationships. “To have it stop would completely upend all the progress that they’ve made,” said Sonya Acosta, policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches housing assistance. “And then you multiply that by 59,000 households,” she said.  The program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, was allocated $5 billion to help pull people out of homelessness, domestic violence and human trafficking.  People from San Francisco to Dallas to Tallahassee, Florida, were enrolled — among them children, seniors and veterans — with the expectation that funding would last until the end of the decade. But with the ballooning cost of rent, that $5 billion will end far faster. Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to “manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.” The program’s future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it’s a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who championed the program four years ago, is pushing for another $8 billion infusion. But the organizations lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers to re-up the funding told the AP they aren’t optimistic. Four GOP lawmakers who oversee the budget negotiations did not respond to AP requests for comment. “We’ve been told it’s very much going to be an uphill fight,” said Kim Johnson, the public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition. Daniris Espinal walks through Sunset Park, in the Brooklyn borough of New York, Thursday, April 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)  Espinal and her two daughters, aged 4 and 19, are living on one of those vouchers in a three-bedroom apartment with an over $3,000 monthly rent — an amount extremely difficult to cover without the voucher. Four years ago, Espinal fought her way out of a marriage where her husband controlled her decisions, from seeing her family and friends to leaving the apartment to go shopping. When she spoke up, her husband said she was wrong, or in the wrong or crazy. Isolated and in the haze of postpartum depression, she didn’t know what to believe. “Every day, little by little, I started to feel not like myself,” she said. “It felt like my mind wasn’t mine.” When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband’s urging and he had promised to cover family expenses. Police reports documenting her husband’s bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said. But her future was precarious: She was alone, owed thousands of dollars in back rent and had no income to pay it or support her newborn and teenage daughters. Financial aid to prevent evictions during the pandemic kept Espinal afloat, paying her back rent and keeping the family out of shelters. But it had an expiration date. Around that time, the Emergency Housing Vouchers program was rolled out, targeting people in Espinal’s situation. Daniris Espinal stands for a portrait in Sunset Park, in the Brooklyn borough of New York, Thursday, April 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)  A “leading cause of family homelessness is domestic violence” in New York City, said Gina Cappuccitti, director of housing access and stability services at New Destiny Housing, a nonprofit that has connected 700 domestic violence survivors to the voucher program. Espinal was one of those 700, and moved into her Brooklyn apartment in 2023. The relief went beyond finding a secure place to live, she said. “I gained my worth, my sense of peace, and I was able to rebuild my identity.” Now, she said, she’s putting aside money in case of the worst. Because, “that’s my fear, losing control of everything that I’ve worked so hard for.” ___ Bedayn is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.Report for Americais a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.",Politics,1

Core Democratic groups are preparing to be targeted by the Trump administration,https://apnews.com/article/democrats-trump-actblue-indivisible-legal-threat-fbi-42f502bcb5888b12628629710c6eb21b,AP News,,15-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — As PresidentDonald Trumppushes the historical boundaries of executive power, some of the Democratic Party’s core political institutions are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them. The Democrats’ dominant national fundraising platform, ActBlue, and the party’s largest protest group, Indivisible, are working with their attorneys for just such a scenario, according to officials within both organizations. Trump’s top political allies have suggested both groups should face prosecution. Other Democratic allies are planning for Trump-backed legal crackdowns as well. Wary of antagonizing the Republican president, most prefer to stay anonymous for now. “Every one of our clients is concerned about being arbitrarily targeted by the Trump administration. We are going to great lengths to help clients prepare for or defend themselves,” said Ezra Reese, political law chair at Elias Law Group, which represents Democratic groups and candidates and is chaired by Marc Elias, the lawyer who has himself been a Trump target. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment when asked about potential investigations into ActBlue and Indivisible. But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not downplay the threat of a potential criminal probe when asked specifically whether Trump wants the FBI, the Treasury Department or any other federal agency to investigate Democratic groups. “Anyone who has not broken the law should not be worried,” Leavitt told The Associated Press. “If you have broken the law and engaged in the weaponization of justice, then you should be worried. It’s that simple.”  Indeed, far from distancing themselves from talk of retribution, many key Republicans are embracing it. Trump’s allies argue they are justified in seeking vengeance due to the fourcriminal prosecutionsagainst Trump, one of which led tomultiple felony convictionsin New York. There’s no evidence then-President Joe Biden influencedthe Trump prosecutionsin any way. Matt Schlapp, president of the American Conservative Union, said Democrats needed to be taught not to touch a hot stove. “Someone needs to get burned for all this activity or they’re just gonna do it again,” he said. “And that’s not hypocrisy. That’s justice.” Trump has made no secret of his plans to use the power of the federal government to target domestic political adversaries. Duringa norm-breaking speechat the Department of Justice last month, Trump cast himself as the country’s “chief law enforcement officer,” a title ordinarily reserved for the attorney general. On April 9, Trump signed an executive order instructing the Justice Department toinvestigate Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official who anonymously penned a book highly critical of his first presidency. Trump said that Taylor was likely guilty of treason, a crime that can carry the death penalty. Indivisible has been perhaps the most important group in the Democratic resistance since Trump returned to the White House. The group’s leadership in Washington holds regular calls with state-based activists and recently released a detailed protest guide, which offers specific guidance to hundreds of local chapters across the country. This year alone, Indivisible groups have hosted more than 1,000 protests covering every state in the nation. The group was a key organizer in the recent Hands Off! protests that attracted hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Trump top adviser and billionaireElon Muskhas publicly condemned Indivisible as “criminals.” The statement was an apparent reference to violent attacks against Tesla dealerships and vehicles, whichhave spikedin recent weeks. Indivisible’s leadership released a guide earlier in the year encouraging protests outside Tesla dealerships, although the guide instructs protesters to remain peaceful and stay off private property. No charges are known to have been filed against Indivisible or its leaders. But Indivisible co-founder Ezra Levin says it’s critical that Democratic institutions work together to speak out against the threats posed by the Trump administration. His organization has been discussing contingency plans with attorneys and other activists in the event that he or other Indivisible leaders face criminal charges. “They may try to come at us directly, or it’s as likely that their non-state actors are inspired by their lies and propaganda, and try to come at us individually,” Levin said. “And that is a risk in a moment where you’re facing anti-democratic threats like we are.” “Our choice is, we can be quiet and hope that they won’t target us, or we can try to work as a mass opposition,” he continued. “If you’re not willing to do that, what are you doing here?” Musk, backed by several Republican members of Congress, has also called on the FBI to investigate ActBlue, alleging that the Democratic Party’s main fundraising platform has skirted campaign finance laws and allowed foreign nationals to make illegal contributions to Democratic candidates. “I think the FBI’s going to do something on ActBlue soon,” Charlie Kirk, a key Trump ally who founded the conservative group Turning Point USA, said at a political event last month in Wisconsin. ActBlue officials this week told the AP that they would continue to fully cooperate with a congressional investigation led by House Republicans into allegations of fraud within the organization. Republican investigators have recently requested that ActBlue staffers testify behind closed doors in addition to providing a second batch of documents. Even before the congressional investigation concludes, multiple House Republicans have encouraged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue requested criminal investigations into ActBlue. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., has asked the Treasury Department to investigate allegations that the nonprofit processed payments to “terror-linked organizations.” Separately, Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the FBI last month claiming that ActBlue is being used to “to skirt the integrity of federal campaign finance laws” by allowing foreign nationals to contribute to campaigns, among other allegations of criminal wrongdoing. “It must be emphasized that these allegations, were they to prove true, would indicate a serious threat to the integrity of our elections, besides the victimization of American citizens,” Biggs wrote. ActBlue said it is preparing for the possibility of many different attacks on various fronts, including investigations by the FBI or the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, Democratic candidates are relying on ActBlue to fund their campaigns as never before. Donors have given more than $400 million to Democratic candidates through ActBlue over the first three months of the year, the organization told the AP. The fundraising haul represents the most money raised in any first quarter in ActBlue’s two-decade history. While Republicans accuse the group of being funded by wealthy donors, ActBlue acts as a passthrough between donors and candidates that’s funded by a 3.95% processing fee on each donation. “These unfounded attacks haven’t shaken us — they’ve sharpened our resolve to fuel Democratic wins,” ActBlue spokesperson Megan Hughes said. “As our first-quarter fundraising demonstrates, Democratic grassroots donors are engaged, undeterred and ready to meet this moment.”",Politics,1
"Even in Alabama, some Republicans worry about Trump’s sweeping agenda",https://apnews.com/article/trump-alabama-republicans-doge-tariffs-e8d6561f1be73a557842c1342d5084b4,AP News,Bill Barrow,9-04-25,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — On a day when stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl led a celebration of the president whoseglobal tariffssparked the sell-off. With no mention of the Wall Street roller coaster and global economic uncertainty, Wahl declared his state GOP’s “Trump Victory Dinner” — and the broader national moment — a triumph. And for anyone who rejectsPresident Donald Trump, his agenda and the “America First” army that backs it all, Wahl had an offer: “The Alabama Republican Party will buy them a plane ticket to any country in the world they want to go to.” Wahl’s audience — an assembly of lobbyists and donors, state lawmakers, local party officials and grassroots activists — laughed, applauded and sometimes roared throughout last week’s gala in downtown Birmingham, the rare Democratic stronghold in one of the nation’s most Republican states. The president’s son Donald Trump Jr. elicited perhaps the most enthusiasm with an unapologetically partisan pitch, even repeatingthe lie that his father wonthe 2020 election over Democrat Joe Biden. Yet beyond the cheerleading, there were signs of a more cautious optimism and some worried whispers over Trump’s sweeping tariffs, the particulars ofhis deportation policyand the aggressive slashing byhis Department of Government Efficiency. That doesn’t mean Trump or Republicans are in danger of losing their grip in Alabama, where the GOP holds all statewide offices, dominates the Legislature and has won every presidential electoral vote since 1980. But it’s a notable wrinkle in a place where there’s long been tension between relying on the federal government for funding and jobs, and an embrace of the kind of anti-Washington, anti-establishment populism that has twice propelled Trump to the Oval Office. And any cracks for Trump in Alabama — where he got 65% of the vote in 2024 — could portend trouble elsewhere, as the effects of a seismic shift in U.S. policy reach across the economy and society.  “There are some concerns, some conversations,” said John Merrill, a former secretary of state, over just what Trump’s agenda will mean on the ground. Alabama, he acknowledged, has “been a net recipient” of the very federal government and economic model Trump is upending, meaning it receives more money back from Washington than its taxpayers send the federal government. “It’s a big risk,” said Merrill, who sported a Trump 45-47 pin on his lapel, a nod to the president’s two terms. Blocks to the south of the complex where Republicans convened sits the multibillion-dollar University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, a regional gem where research depends on grants fromthe National Institutes of Health. Republican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, listed as a “Silver Sponsor” of the gala, didn’t join the Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration to stopthe cancellation of certain research funding streamsCongress already has approved. Most of the medical services provided at UAB and many other hospitals throughout the state are covered byMedicare and Medicaid, two of the largest federal outlays. Alabama, because its per-capita income ranks among the lower tier among states, has one of the most generous federal match rates for Medicaid funding. A short drive west toward Tuscaloosa sitsa gargantuan Mercedes-Benz complex, one of the earliest examples of foreign auto manufacturers coming to the American South, where state laws arehostile to organized labor. The plants have provided jobs at wages higher than the local norms but in some cases lower than in union shops of the Great Lakes region around Detroit. Many suppliers have followed in the South, but not so many that the assembly plants don’t still import many parts that now will be subject toTrump’s tariffs. Terry Martin, a county GOP committeeman in Tallapoosa County, said he supports the tariffs as leverage. Trump has “something to bargain with,” Martin said. But, “the parts that are coming from overseas … it’s going to pop it up” in price, he said, at least in the short term. Agriculture, meanwhile, is still a dominant Alabama industry. Meat processing plants in the North and row crop farms in the South depend on migrant labor that Merrill, the former secretary of state, said involves workers who are in the U.S. both legally and illegally. Alabama, he recalled, passed its own strict immigration bill during Barack Obama’s presidency only to roll it back after industry leaders complained of a depleted workforce. Wahl, in an interview after the gala, took a more nuanced approach than he did at the podium. “It is possible to secure our border and still take into account migrants who deserve to be here,” he said. “This has to be a two-pronged approach.” Back in Birmingham, Interstate 65 splits the city. The aging, increasingly congested artery is a local priority for widening. The proposal has support from Alabama’s two Republican senators, Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt. U.S. interstate projects, though, are typically a 90-10 split, meaning 90% of the money comes from Washington, 10% from the state. That funding — along with money for schools, Medicaid and other areas — could be at risk with Trump adviser Elon Musk and DOGE carrying Trump’s blessing to slash spending. GOP lawmakers who control Congress have supported Trump’s agenda, which also includesdismantling the Education Department. Tallapoosa County GOP Chair Denise Bates said “absolutely” there’s a possibility DOGE could go too far. “I hope there are guardrails,” she said, noting she was once a local school board member. “Am I 100% for getting rid of the Department of Education? I can’t say that I am,” she said, adding a phrase similar to Merrill’s description of the state as a whole. “You know, we’re a net receiver.” Yet for all the caveats offered in one-on-one conversations, the GOP crowd cheered when Tuberville, the former football coach turnedTrump acolyte on Capitol Hill, offered a plainspoken defense of Musk and his pop-up agency, telling the crowd, “We’re dead broke.” And they roared as he addressed tariffs. “It’s past time we level the playing field and tell the rest of the world to get off their ass and start paying their fair share,” Tuberville said. Bates argued that Alabama’s embrace of Trump’s “America First” push is not simply loyalty to the president. She said it reflects generations of voters watching the steel industry decline in Birmingham and, after the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994, the textile industry leaving for Mexico and, eventually, Southeast Asia. “We just want jobs,” she said. Still, state Sen. Jabo Waggoner, the longest-serving member of the Alabama Legislature, made clear Trump’s visceral appeal, declaring him “the most popular president here since Ronald Reagan, hands down.” Wahl recalled Trump’sfirst massive outdoor rallyas a presidential candidate: 30,000 people at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, in August 2015. Wahl, who owns a butterfly farm outside Huntsville, said perhaps the best way to understand Trump and Alabama and this moment of uncertainty is to see a president who, at least to his supporters in the state, has earned the benefit of the doubt. “He’s going to let everybody know he’s serious,” the chairman said. Trump is “going to bring people to the bargaining table. We’re actually going to see the negotiator conduct business.”",Politics,1
Where are federal jobs affected by DOGE cuts? A look at congressional districts across the US,https://apnews.com/article/doge-federal-job-cuts-congressional-districts-data-5d79e2a7ef2160166b0bee59dfa4e9e2,AP News,Meg Kinnard,27-02-25,"▶ Follow live updates onPresident Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — Civilian federal jobs are being cut by the thousands, as Elon Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiencycontinues to shrink the government workforce at the behest of PresidentDonald Trump. That’s brought a lot ofchurn and uncertaintyin the nation’s capital, where 20% of the country’s more than 2 million civilian — or nonmilitary — federal workers are located. It’s also affecting workers and communities outside the Washington, D.C. area, where about 80% of that workforce is based. Those cuts mean that members of Congress are now facing potential angst among the out-of-work federal employees in their districts across the country. The precise locations of all of the thousands of federal employees now out of work isn’t yet known, but a look at the areas with the highest concentrations of civilian U.S. government jobs gives a glimpse at some places that could be most affected. Here’s a breakdown of federal government jobs across the country by the numbers, surveying data from a Congressional Research Service analysis of Census Bureau estimates, as of 2023:  It’s no surprise that the District of Columbia has the highest percentage of federal workers, who account for 18.5% of the total workforce. And the areas immediately outside the city, in what’s known as the DMV — which includes Washington and parts of Maryland and Virginia — are next up with the highest concentrations of federal workers, with the top nine districts where percentages of federal workers range from 18.2% down to 8.4%. Most of those districts are represented by Democrats, meaning that some of the areas — albeit those in the D.C. area — likely to have the most significant impacts from DOGE cuts are represented by that party in the U.S. House. The one with the highest percentage of federal workforce is Maryland’s 5th District, represented by Democratic Rep. Steny Hoyer. There, about 18.2% of all workers are employed by the federal government. After the districts closest to Washington, D.C., there are GOP-represented areas with high federal worker percentages. Virginia’s 2nd District, represented by Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans — along the state’s southeastern border with North Carolina — is the GOP area with the highest concentration of federal workers, at 8.1%. Home to Virginia Beach, and a large U.S. Navy presence, it’s considered among the nation’s most politically competitive districts. Central Oklahoma’s 4th District, represented by GOP Rep. Tom Cole, has a workforce where 7.7% is employed by the federal government. The district is home to Fort Sill Army Post and Tinker Air Force Base, the latter of which includes the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex. Oklahoma’s largest single-site employer, according to Tinker’s website, the complex provides support for dozens of other Air Force Bases. Federal employees make up 7.6% of the workforce in Alabama’s 5th District, which includes Huntsville and is represented by Republican Rep. Dale Strong. The area encompasses NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, which has had a role in rocket engineering and U.S. space exploration efforts from the Saturn rockets integral to moon missions, the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station’s laboratory modules. The data examined here doesn’t pertain directly to military jobs. Thousands of civilian government employees across the country work in areas near or attached to military installations. Alaska’s sole U.S. House member, Rep. Nick Begich, represents a state with a total federal worker percentage of 6.3%. Scott Goldsmith, an economist at the University of Alaska Anchorage, has described the state’s economy as a “three-legged stool” kept balanced by three components: the oil and gas industry, the federal government, and then all other industries combined. The federal government manages a significant amount of land in Alaska. Workers are employed by the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management and the Fish and Wildlife Service, among others. All three of New Mexico’s House districts are represented by Democrats, and all of them have significant federal workforces. Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory, two major federal research institutions, are located in the state, where the federal government is the No. 2 largest employer, according to the New Mexico Partnership. Percentages of federal workers across the districts range from 6.3% in Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez’s 3rd District to 6.2% in Rep. Gabriel Vasquez’s 2nd District. In the 1st District, represented by Rep. Melanie Ann Stansbury, the workforce is 6.8% federal employees. ___ Kinnard can be reached athttp://x.com/MegKinnardAP",Politics,1
Trump’s transactional approach to diplomacy is a driving force on the world stage,https://apnews.com/article/trump-transactional-diplomacy-tariffs-russia-ukraine-canada-e70f0e800b1c7891a0fa4f21a28c67af,AP News,Aamer Madhani,9-03-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) —Donald Trump, the real estate developer turned commander in chief, is laying bare his style of diplomacy in the early weeks of his new term: It’s a whole lot like a high-stakes business deal, and his No. 1 goal is to come out of the transaction on top. The tactics are clear in hisbrewing trade warwith Canada and Mexico, in his approach toRussia’s war on Ukraineand in his selection of the first country he will visit in his second term. “President Trump approaches diplomacy and engages in a very transactional manner, with economics as the foundation and driving force behind international affairs,” retiredLt. Gen. Keith Kellogg,the president’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, explained at an event in Washington this past week. For Trump, it’s about leverage, not friendship; dollars as much as values; and hard power versus soft. It’s not just a matter of negotiating style. At stake is the post-World War II international order as Trump’s actions raise doubts about American leadership around the globe. He’s shaping a foreign policy that’s more inward looking and conscious of the bottom line, dismissing American soft-power levers such as theU.S. Agency for International Developmentasdubious and riddled by wasteand suggesting that the United Statesmight not defend fellow NATO membersthat aren’t meeting defense spending benchmarks set by the alliance. Politics and presidents to a certain degree are all transactional. But Trump, who helped make himself a household name by burnishing an image as an intrepid real estate dealmaker, is taking it to another level as he navigates an increasingly complicated world. The Republican president, in his previous life as a real estate titan, saw every deal as one in which there were clear winners and losers. In his return to the White House, he is more demonstrably injecting a what’s-in-it-for-me approach to his dealings with both friend and foe. Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian who has studied the American presidency, said Trump’s “ledger” approach might not be the most practical way to conduct diplomacy. Frantz observed that Trump, 78, a baby boomer and football fan, seems inspired in his foreign policymaking by the ethos of legendary pro football coach Vince Lombardi, who famously said, “Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing.” “But diplomacy, especially in a more complicated world, might be more like soccer,” Frantz said. “Sometimes you just need a tie. Sometimes you need to just survive and move on.” Trump on Thursday told reporters that he has decided to make Saudi Arabia the first overseas visit of his new term because the oil-rich kingdom has agreed to make a huge investment in the United States over the next four years. “They’ve gotten richer, we’ve all gotten older. So I said, ’I’ll go if you pay a trillion dollars, $1 trillion to American companies,’” Trump said. He also made the kingdom his first overseas stop during his first White House term after the Saudis promised $450 billion in U.S. investment. Trump acknowledged that the United Kingdom, one of America’s oldest allies, has traditionally been the first stop for U.S. presidents. But money talks. In his dealings with Ukrainian PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyand Russian PresidentVladimir Putin, Trump has highly focused on who has the leverage. Putin has “the cards” and Zelenskyy does not, Trump has said repeatedly. Zelenskyy appeared to be making some strides in assuaging Trump after their recent rocky meeting in the Oval Office ended with Trump and Vice President JD Vance criticizing the Ukrainian leader for what they said was insufficient gratitude for the tens of billions of dollars in U.S. assistance provided in the three years since Russia invaded. Zelenskyy said later that how that meeting went down was“regrettable.”He also made clear he was ready to sign off on a minerals deal with the U.S. — even without the explicit American security guarantees sought by the Ukrainians — that Trump wants. In hisTuesday addressbefore a joint session of Congress, Trump acknowledged Zelenskyy’s fence-mending efforts. Trump also announced plans to send top advisers to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with Ukrainian officials. But soon Trump was back to criticizing Zelenskyy, saying he does not have the leverage to keep fighting the war with Russia. “I’m finding it more difficult, frankly, to deal with Ukraine, and they don’t have the cards,” Trump said. “In terms of getting a final settlement, it may be easier dealing with Russia, which is surprising, because they have all the cards.” Trump’s push on Zelenskyy — and pivot toward Moscow — marks a significant departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward Russia since the Cold War. Others before Trump, including Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have tried resets with Russia, but perhaps never at a time as fraught. Deep skepticism toward Moscow, even in the best moments in the relationship, has been the standard operating posture in both Republican and Democratic administrations. But Trump, who ran on a promise to quickly end the war, has veered from Democratic President Joe Biden’s approach of making no major decision that could impact Ukraine without Kyiv’s involvement. At the same time, the new Republican administration has taken steps toward a more cooperative line with Putin, for whom Trump has long shown admiration. Trump has ordered a pause on U.S. military aid for and intelligence-sharing with Kyiv,halted offensive cyberoperationsagainst Russia by U.S. Cyber Command anddisbanded a programaimed at seizing the assets of Russian oligarchs as a means to punish the Kremlin for its invasion. Kellogg, who also served in Trump’s first White House, recalled seeing Trump’s “transactional diplomacy approach” early in the first term. Kellogg said that the president’s first question in meetings with foreign leaders was often the same. “As I found the very first time we were in the Cabinet room when a foreign official came in, the comment was, ’What is the trade imbalance between our two nations?’'' Kellogg recalled, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations event. The trade ledger has been top of mind for Trump as he argues that for too long America has been played by friends and adversaries, including neighbors Canada and Mexico. Trump last week announced 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico and some imports from Canada amid widespread fears of the economic fallout from abroader trade war. He then postponed most of them. The White House insists the pending tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of fentanyl. Trump has also at times suggested that the tariffs could be resolved by fixing the trade deficit. The president on Friday was back to excoriating Canada, this time complaining about policies he said are hurting American dairy farmers and the lumber industry. He said he will act soon to even the ledger with Canada through reciprocal tariffs. “Canada has been ripping us off for years on lumber and on dairy products,” Trump said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whom Trump has taken to belittling as the governor of America’s 51st state, said his country will not be backing down from Trump’s trade war. The episode has underscored Trump’s willingness to embrace hard power to resolve differences, even if it means testing one of the world’s mostdurable and amicablealliances. The center-left Trudeau was so flummoxed by Trump’s move that he found himself quoting the sharply conservative Wall Street Journal editorial page to make the point that this fight was unnecessary. “It’s not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal,” Trudeau said. “But Donald, they point out that even though you’re a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.” ___ AP White House correspondent Zeke Miller contributed to this report.",Politics,1
Young people who aspired to government service dismayed by Trump ending the federal fellows program,https://apnews.com/article/trump-musk-doge-federal-workforce-presidential-fellow-0e2acf445d13c08251d9d28653797c6e,AP News,,10-03-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A young economist who had uprooted her life for civil service. A fierce housing advocate terminated just before buying her first home. A semifinalist whose dreams were dashed before they materialized. For decades, the Presidential Management Fellows program was seen as a building block for the civil service with the expectation that the few who earned the position would one day become leaders in the federal workforce. Now the road ahead is uncertain. Hundreds of the fellows have been terminated or placed on administrative leave amid a nationwideslashing of the federal workforce. One of President Donald Trump’s executive ordersended the program, which was created in 1978 to entice highly qualified workers with advanced degrees to join the federal government. Trump’s Republican administration had ordered agencies tolay offnearly all probationary employees, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers in one fell swoop. That included recent classes of the fellows program, which has a two-year probationary period. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports young and highly qualified civil servants are dismayed as President Trump ends federal fellows program. Fellows had persevered through an intense selection process that included multiple tests and evaluations as well as a blind interview. The agency website said about 10% of applicants are accepted, although that number has been recently as low as just 3%. Charles Conyers, an Office of Personnel Management retiree who was a fellow in the class of 2003, said he was saddened and puzzled about the administration eliminating a program that brought to the government some of the “brightest minds in America.” He said losing their skills and ending a program that attracted and groomed exceptional future leaders was tragic.  While many fellows affected bythe job cutswere reluctant to speak on the record, several did. As a group, they said they loved their jobs and see federal civil service as a way to serve their country. All would welcome, if given a chance, the opportunity to get back to work and use their expertise. Jenn Kauffman, who has a background inpublic healthand labor studies, was a semifinalist for the fellows program this year and had been waiting to hear if she would be accepted. As layoffs were announced, she began to worry if it would continue. “I worked really hard and wanted that satisfaction to see it through,” she said. On Feb. 19, during the week finalists would have been named, the Trump administration announced an executive order cutting the program. Kauffman, 45, said she was crushed by the decision and worries that the mass layoffs and dissolution of the fellows program will forever change public service. “It’s so easy to decimate something but so much harder to rebuild,” she said. “And I worry that the incredibly talented people who may have been my cohort or colleagues are going to go elsewhere, and there will be an incredible brain drain. It’s such a loss for the American people.” Sydney Smith, 28, said many of the fellows were shocked at being let go because they came in to the government with ideas on how to make it more efficient. Smith studied chemistry as an undergraduate student at Willamette University in Oregon before going on to study accounting at George Washington University. She heard about the presidential fellows program but was skeptical she would get in because of the low acceptance rate. After she made it as a finalist in 2023, she started working forthe U.S. Forest Serviceas an accountant. She’s a backpacker who loves the outdoors and is passionate about making public lands accessible. It was a perfect fit. Now Smith’s goal is to finish the CPA exams, something she was doing to make herself even more qualified for federal service. “I’m hopeful that in the future that there will be room for me in the government,” she said. “I don’t know what that would look like, but I am hopeful that it still exists.” McKenzie Hartman, 26, was an economist forthe IRSresearch division in Ogden, Utah, when she received an email Feb. 19 that she should return to the office with all her equipment. The next day, a manager collected her equipment and walked her out. On the way home, Hartman took a wrong turn because her mind was elsewhere. “It felt surreal,” she said. “I had planned on working for the federal government since high school.” Hartman lost access to her office’s video conferencing software and couldn’t join her colleagues for her own goodbye gathering. She had to call in instead. Her termination letter came the following weekend. “It’s crazy to get a letter terminating you for performance when everyone around you is saying incredible things about your performance,” Hartman said. Since then, she has been applying for jobs and embarked on a road trip with her partner through several national parks, where she’s seen protests against the Trump administration’s cuts. “For a lot of us, there is a question on whether we’ll return to federal service,” she said. “Many of us would like to, and this was what we wanted for our careers, but it’s demoralizing.” Bianca Nelson, 31, had been working forthe Department of Housing and Urban Developmentin the unit she calls the “front door of HUD.” She never planned to leave. On Feb. 14, she got an email that she was terminated, effective immediately. Nelson and her partner were planning to buy their first home that month — their “dream apartment.” Now, they’ve had to lean on savings to keep them afloat. She called it “gut-wrenching.” She had to forward the termination email to her boss, who had not been told she or others would be fired. Days later, she picked up her belongings, including a bell given to her at a New York City Housing Authority groundbreaking ceremony — a memento representing her love for her work. Since then, she has spent her days organizing paperwork for unemployment and insurance, taking networking calls, volunteering with her union, organizing a resource fair for other fired federal workers in her area and volunteering with housing advocacy organizations. Ending the program, she said, is “closing a pipeline to future leaders.” Madeleine Parker’s fellowship began in September 2023, one month after she finished her doctorate degree in city and regional planning from the University of California, Berkeley. Parker, 32, chose towork in housingbecause of its importance in offering families stability. She said she had hoped to continue working for the federal government. “It’s been hard to step back from that,” she said. She is trying to strategize on what comes next while worrying about the people who need the help. “There’s the personal impact of my own job, but I have this immense concern about the impacts on the people we serve, from the programs I worked on and that my colleagues worked on, from affordable housing development to disaster recovery,” she said. Juliane Alfen, 25, left her workplace atthe U.S. Agency for International Developmentin tears, exiting to cheers from supporters who protested the abrupt way one of the world’s preeminent aid organizations had been decimated. A 2023 fellow, her goal was to build a life and career around federal service. Alfen learned of the fellowship through her graduate school program in international affairs at the University of California, San Diego. The day she learned she’d made it to finalist, she said, “I literally screamed and called my mom on the phone.” There had been more than 10,000 initial applicants. Now, when she looks at her LinkedIn account, everyone is job hunting. She said she would love the opportunity to return to USAID, thoughthe prospects for that are uncertaingiven the Trump administration’s gutting of the agency through his adviserElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiencyand halting its humanitarian work. “I feel,” Alfen said, “like we made a difference.” ___ Fernando reported from Chicago.",Politics,1
5 economic forces that could shape the first year of Trump’s presidency,https://apnews.com/article/trump-inflation-debt-tariffs-wealth-immigrant-ea7d1ee97cae226fa4d427737ddaa22a,AP News,Josh Boak,24-01-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Like most presidents,Donald Trumpfaces an economy that seldom bends to political ambitions. The Republican has promised strong growth, high tariffs, income tax cuts and booming oilfields. But despite the solid job market and low 4.1% unemployment rate, he has to contend with headwinds like inflation, a budget deficit, increased tensions over trade, the fallout from his plans to curtail immigration and a persistent wealth gap. Each of these issues could help to shape how voters feel about a president they returned to the White House with the specific goal of fixing the economy. For his part, Trump wants to blame all the challenges before him on his predecessor, Joe Biden, who in turn blamed Trump in 2021 for the problems his own administration had to tackle. “This begins with confronting the economic chaos caused by the failed policies of the last administration,” Trump told theWorld Economic Forumon Thursday. Here are five economic forces that could shape the first year of Trump’s presidency: Whipping inflation is easier said than done. In AP VoteCast, an extensive survey of last year’s electorate, 4 in 10 voters called inflation the “single most important factor” in their choice for president. About two-thirds of this group voted for Trump — a sign he owes his victory in large part to the high cost of groceries, gasoline, housing, autos and other goods. Going forward, monthly reports on the consumer price index will be a clear measure of whether Trump can deliver. But inflation has actually increased in recent months. Consumer prices were increasing at a healthy 2.4% annual rate in September, compared with 2.9% in December. Economists say inflation could worsen if Trump imposes tariffs and uses deficit-funded income tax cuts.  Republicans often hit Biden hard on egg prices. But Democrats could use similar attacks on Trump. Over the past year, coffee costs have risen just 1% for U.S. consumers, but theInternational Monetary Fundhas the price of the actual beans climbing 55% in a sign that lattes, espressos and plain old cups of joe could soon cost more. Then there’s housing. Voters are still frustrated by high mortgage rates and prices staying elevated due to a shortage of properties. Shelter is 37% of the consumer price index. Price increases for housing have eased, but shelter costs are still rising at 4.6% a year, compared with annual increasesaveraging 3.3% before the pandemic. Trump is betting that more energy production can cut into inflation rates, but domestic production is already near record levels, according to the government. Trump says 25% tariffs are coming forMexican and Canadian importsas soon as Feb. 1. He’s also talked about additional tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods. His stated goal is to stop illegal border crossings and the flow of chemicals used to make drugs such as fentanyl. For Trump, tariffs are a diplomatic tool for his policy goals. But they’re also a threat possibly meant to jumpstart trade talks. They’re also a revenue raiser that he claims could bring trillions of dollars into the treasury. Trump did increase tariffs during his first term, with revenue collection more than doubling to an annual rate of $85.4 billion, which might sound like a lot but was equal to just 0.4% of the gross domestic product. Multiple analyses by theBudget Lab at Yaleand thePeterson Institute for International Economics, among others, say the threatened tariffs would increase costs for a typical family in a way that effectively raises taxes. What really matters is whether Trump delivers on his threats. That is why Ben Harris, a former Biden adviser who is now director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, says voters should focus on average tariff rates. “Trade is really tricky” Harris said. “But in broad terms, look at what he does and not what he says.” Trump likes to blame inflation on the national debt, saying Biden’s policies flooded the U.S. economy with more money than it could absorb. But about 22% of the $36 trillion outstanding total debt originated from the policies of Trump’s first term, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog. Paul Winfree, a former Trump staffer who is now president and CEO of the Economic Policy Innovation Center, warned in a recent analysis that the U.S. is getting too close for comfort to its fiscal limits. His analysis suggests that if Trump can preserve 3% growth he could extend his expiring 2017 tax cuts while keeping the debt sufficiently stable by cutting spending $100 billion to $140 billion a year. The risk is that higher borrowing costs and debt can limit what Trump does while keeping borrowing costs high for consumers. Lawmakers who once viewed the debt as problem years away increasingly see it as something to address now. “One of the biggest vibe shifts I’m picking up on now among policymakers is they’re beginning to realize the long-term is today,” Winfree said. Winfree said the key number to watch is the interest rates charged on U.S. debt — which will tell the public if investors think the amount of borrowing is problematic. Interest on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is at roughly 4.6%, up a full percentage point since September. Trump’s executive orders are a clear crackdown on immigration — and that could be a drag on economic growth and cause monthly job gains to slow. Trump often frames immigration as a criminal and national security issue by focusing on people crossing the border illegally. But economies that can’t add enough workers are at risk of stagnating — and the U.S. labor market at this stage needs immigrants as part of the jobs mix. About 84% of America’s net population growth last year came from immigrants, according to theCensus Bureau. That’s 2.8 million immigrants. “They not only work in the economy, but they spend in the economy,” said Satyam Panday, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global Ratings. “Their spending is somebody else’s income in the economy.” If Trump were simply to put immigration back at his 2017 and 2019 averages of 750,000 immigrants annually, growth could slow from an estimated 2.7% last year to 2% going forward, Panday’s analysis found. The construction, agriculture and leisure and hospitality industries would probably struggle to find employees. In other words, it’s worth monitoring the monthly jobs report and immigration flows. Trump is going to have to figure out how to balance the interests of billionaires with those of his blue- collar voters. His inaugural events included several of the world’s wealthiest men: Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH’s Bernard Arnault. Each is worth roughly $200 billion or more, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire’s Index. Scott Ellis, a member of the group Patriotic Millionaires, said it’s worth monitoring just how much their wealth increases under Trump. This year, as of Friday, Arnault’s net worth has risen $23 billion, Bezos is up by $15 billion, Zuckerberg is up by $18 billion and Musk’s wealth has risen by $6 billion. Those are all monthly increases. By contrast, the most recent available Census Bureau data show that the median U.S. household wealth rose $9,600 in 2021-2022, to $176,500.",Politics,1
Republicans once railed against armed IRS agents. Now they want them for immigration enforcement,https://apnews.com/article/armed-irs-agents-immigration-enforcement-0065756e7e44b0de2027d5a6f60e60a5,AP News,Fatima Hussein,12-02-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For years, Republicans, including PresidentDonald Trump, have railed against theIRSand its cadre of armed agents. Now the administration has big plans for them: It wants the agents to assist with immigration enforcement. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent a request to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to borrow IRS workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a recent letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS’s boost in funding, though the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act hasalready been clawed back. Noem’s request, asking for workers from the IRS Criminal Investigation unit within the Treasury Department, is a change in Republicans’ tone toward these workers but also exemplifies Trump’s focus on border security. It points to a broader shift in the overall direction of the federal workforce under the Trump administration — with workers beingcoaxed to resign, redesignated to different jobs or eventually be fired. Republicans, both those in office and on the campaign trail, havelong claimed — falsely— that the IRS planned to hire 87,000 armed agents to harass middle-income earners. But the IRS Criminal Investigation unit, which employed 2,144 special agents in 2023, is different from the larger IRS workforce of roughly 89,000 workers. These are the agents with guns who work on trafficking, fraud and other criminal cases in the field. Now DHS wants those agents to serve in task forces with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, targeting employers engaged in unlawful hiring practices, monitoring immigrants in the country illegally and other tasks.  “Treasury has qualified law enforcement personnel available to assist with immigration enforcement, especially in light of recent increases to the Internal Revenue Service’s work force and budget,” Noem said in her letter to Bessent. Trump teased the idea in January in Las Vegas, when he said of IRS employees: “We’re in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them or maybe we’ll move them to the border.” Experts in the tax and immigration fields say this particular request for diverting workers is unusual and could result in a loss of tax revenue. While there is precedent across administrations for reassigning federal workers to do work unrelated to their original jobs, Noem’s request to Bessent is “extraordinary,” says Donald Williamson, the former executive director of the Kogod Tax Center at American University. That’s in part because it calls for mobilizing people who don’t often deal with immigration issues and puts the ball in Bessent’s court to choose among thousands of IRS workers to serve DHS’s mission, he said. “I don’t really look at IRS officials as G-men,” he said. Williamson said he doesn’t consider DHS’s request as inconsistent with Republicans’ earlier criticisms of IRS hiring, but he noted that “it’s a redirecting of the IRS’s efforts” to align with the administration’s priorities. “They have expertise of auditing employers” and can do some of the tasks outlined in Noem’s memo, he said. Chloe East, who studies immigration policy and is a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution, said tapping into the IRS workforce to focus on the border rather than on catching tax evaders will likely result in lower tax revenues at a time when the Trump administration says it isfocused on cutting the deficit. “We’re talking about billions of dollars in lost tax revenue” by shuffling IRS workers, East said. She said thepassage of the Laken Riley Actwill require the presence of more officers at the border. “The Trump administration would rather pursue immigrants rather than pursue money launderers,” she said. Representatives from IRS Criminal Investigation and Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.",Politics,1
US Supreme Court appears likely to uphold Obamacare’s preventive care coverage mandate,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-obamacare-preventive-care-302c4a0de7c72461a6617b8271b3fba6,AP News,Lindsay Whitehurst,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — TheSupreme Courtseemed likely to uphold a key preventive-care provision of the Affordable Care Act in a case heard Monday. Conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett appeared skeptical of arguments that Obamacare’s process for deciding which services must be fully covered by private insuranceis unconstitutional. The case could have big ramifications for the law’s preventive care coverage requirements for an estimated 150 million Americans. Medications and services that could be affected include statins to prevent heart disease, lung cancer screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and medication to lower the chance of breast cancer for high-risk women. The plaintiffs argued that requirements to cover those medications and services are unconstitutional because a volunteer board of medical experts that recommended them should have been Senate- approved. The challengers have also raised religious and procedural objections. The Trump administration defended the mandate before the court, though President Donald Trump has been a critic of the law. The Justice Department said board members don’t need Senate approval because they can be removed by the health and human services secretary. A majority of the justices seemed inclined to side with the government. Kavanaugh said he didn’t see indications in the law that the board was designed to have the kind of power that would require Senate approval, and Barrett questioned the plaintiff’s apparently “maximalist” interpretation of the board’s power.  A ruling is expected by the end of June. Some justices suggested they could send the case back to the conservative U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, leaving unanswered questions about which medications and services remain covered. The case came before the court after the appeals courtstruck down some preventive carecoverage requirements. It sided with Christian employers and Texas residents who argued they can’t be forced to provide full insurance coverage for things like medication to prevent HIV and some cancer screenings. They were represented by well-known conservative attorney Jonathan Mitchell, who represented Trump before the high court in a dispute about whether he could appear on the 2024 ballot. Not all preventive care was threatened by the ruling. A 2023 analysis prepared by the nonprofit KFF found that some screenings, including mammography and cervical cancer screening, would still be covered without out-of-pocket costs. The appeals court found that coverage requirements were unconstitutional because they came from a body — the United States Preventive Services Task Force — whose members were not nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",Politics,1
More Democratic lawmakers are visiting El Salvador on Abrego Garcia’s behalf,https://apnews.com/article/abrego-garcia-salvador-deportation-due-process-47a86cd3ad79a121e31c68baee90e4c7,AP News,Matt Brown,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Four House Democratic lawmakers have traveled to El Salvador to call attention to the plight of a man the Trump administration deported to a Salvadoran prison and has refused to help return — even after the Supreme Court ruled that it was the government’s duty to do so. Reps. Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, Maxine Dexter of Oregon, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Robert Garcia of California arrived in the Central American nation on Sunday to investigate the condition ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, who had lived in the United States for more than a decade. The Trump administration deported him, a move that administration officials have said in court filings was erroneous. But despite a Supreme Court ordering the Trump administration to help facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return, the administration has said it has no power to bring him back, a choice being scrutinized by federal courts aspotentially in violation of judicial rulings. From El Salvador on Monday, Dexter posted a video on X saying she and the three other lawmakers had traveled to the Central American country “to demand that Kilmar Abrego Garcia be released.” Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., is welcomed by supporters upon his arrival from meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, at Washington Dulles International Airport, in Chantilly, Va., Friday, April 18, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  “He is being held in violation of a Supreme Court order,” she said. “This is not just a threat to all people in the United States who could be illegally adducted, detained and transported internationally against their will, but it is a fact that our president does not recognize the branches of government and the balances of power.” The quartet’s trip comes after Sen.Chris Van Hollen of Marylandtraveled to El Salvador last week and met Abrego Garcia and Salvadoran officials. Abrego Garcia had lived in Maryland with his wife and three children, who are American citizens, before he was deported on March 15. Abrego Garcia’s protected legal status prohibited him from being deported to El Salvador. He was deported on one of three planes filled with alleged migrant gang members. Garcia said he and Frost sent a letter last week to House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., requesting that an official delegation go to El Salvador to investigate Abrego Garcia’s condition and push for his return, but received no response. Ansari said more Democrats would be traveling to El Salvador in the coming days and weeks. “Those of us in the House who are here greatly admire and support what Sen. Van Hollen did,” Garcia said. Of Abrego Garcia, he said, “His family knew that he was safe, but he’s not home, and so we’ve got to continue the pressure, and we’ve got to ensure that the rule of law in the United States is allowed.” Justice Department lawyers said in court last week that they have no power to advance Abrego Garcia’s return because he is in a foreign country’s custody. Administration officials also claimed in public comments that Abrego Garcia was engaged in human trafficking and terrorism and therefore correctly deported. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that if Abrego Garcia were to return to the U.S., “he would immediately be deported again.” Van Hollen unsuccessfully lobbied the Salvadoran government for Abrego Garcia’s return. He told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday that the United States is facing a “constitutional crisis” if the Trump administration does not follow the Supreme Court’s order to push to bring Abrego Garcia back.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  It’s a warning Democrats are increasingly amplifying. Rather than debate President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policy or the merits of the administration’s invocation of national security to carry out deportations, Democratic lawmakers are zeroing in on the issue of due process, with some noting that the Supreme Court and lower court federal judges found Abrego Garcia was deported without a proper hearing. Ansari said she finds it “extremely alarming” that Trump officials seem to have no regard for due process. “Even with all of the illegal actions we’ve seen over the last couple of months, I think this is the one that terrifies me the most when it comes to the future of our democracy,” she said in an interview. Concerns were also echoed by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote in the court’s ruling in Abrego Garcia’s case: “The government’s argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U. S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene.” Several House Republicans have visited El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, the prison where Abergo Garcia is being held, and lauded the facility for what they view as El Salvador’s tough-on-crime policies. Republican senators and governors have defended Abrego Garcia’s detention as part of a broader crackdown on illegal immigration. But at least one Republican senator called the administration’s deportation of Abrego Garcia a mistake. “The administration won’t admit it. But this was a screw-up,” said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” During a meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office, Trump remarked that “homegrown” lawbreakers should be deported to prisons in the Central American country and urged Bukele to “build about five more places” like the notorious penitentiary where Abrego Garcia is now held. Congressional Republicans have so far shown little interest in negotiating the dispute between the president and the judiciary. Democrats, who are in the minority in both chambers of Congress, have little leverage to pressure the White House. But Abrego Garcia’s case has become both an alarming and galvanizing case inside the party. Democrats “have the power to draw attention to this issue, to keep the pressure up,” Ansari said. “That’s why you know some of us are going, and so many members will be going. Because this is about the future of our democracy and the future of due process as American citizens.” —— Associated Press reporter Megan Janetsky contributed to this report from Mexico City.",Politics,1
JD Vance was one of the last leaders to meet with Pope Francis,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-pope-francis-vatican-meeting-abf9e1a3fbb597778779dafdc6c491d2,AP News,Chris Megerian,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — One ofPope Francis’final encounters before his death was with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who visited the Vatican over the weekend. The meetingtook place on Easter Sunday. Vance, a Catholic convert, entered the room and reached down for the pope’s hand. “Hello,” the vice president said. “So good to see you.” Francis was sitting in a wheelchair, and his words were inaudible in a video released by the Vatican. “I know you’ve not been feeling great, but it’s good see you in better health,” Vance said. A priest serving as a translator spoke for the pope. “These are for your children,” the priest said as someone presented Vance with chocolate eggs. Next came a tray of additional gifts, including rosaries and a Vatican tie. “Thank you,” Vance said as he held the dark tie. “So beautiful.” They posed for a photo, Vance standing to the pope’s right before bidding him farewell. “I pray for you every day,” Vance said. “God bless you.” Vance’s visit was not without political sensitivities, and he met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin on Saturday for what the Vatican described as “an exchange of opinions.” The Catholic Church, under Francis’ leadership, has championed the rights of migrants, while Vance and President Donald Trump have advocated for crackdowns. Vance’s office said the vice president and the cardinal “discussed their shared religious faith, Catholicism in the United States, the plight of persecuted Christian communities around the world, and President Trump’s commitment to restoring world peace.”  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that she had spoken to members of Vance’s team on Monday morning after Francis’ death. “They expressed how excited and grateful they were for the opportunity to have met with the pope just yesterday,” she said. Leavitt added that Francis “touched millions of lives throughout his tenure as the head of the Catholic Church and so it’s a solemn day for Catholics around the world and we are praying for all those who loved the pope and believed in him.” Trump issued a statement on Truth Social: “Rest in Peace Pope Francis! May God Bless him and all who loved him!” At the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, Trump said he signed an executive order for U.S. flags to fly at half-staff in the pope’s honor. “He was a good man,” the president told reporters. “He loved the world and it’s an honor to do that.” Vance, whocontinued on to India after Italy, posted additional thoughts on social media. “I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he wrote on X. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill.” Vance shareda link to remarksthat Francis gave on March 27, 2020, as COVID-19 was spreading around the globe. “I’ll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID,” Vance wrote. “It was really quite beautiful.” Francis had spoken from St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. “Thick darkness has gathered over our squares, our streets and our cities,” he said. “It has taken over our lives, filling everything with a deafening silence and a distressing void.” He encouraged people to rely on their faith to help then endure “because with God life never dies.”",Politics,1
Vance and Modi meet in New Delhi to discuss trade deal and avoid US tariffs,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-india-modi-tariffs-trump-trade-036864827d8ec04745512e185e94d1f8,AP News,Sheikh Saaliq,21-04-25,"NEW DELHI (AP) —U.S. Vice President JD Vanceheld talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday as New Delhi looks to avoid American tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington and strengthen ties with the Trump administration. Vance, who is on a largely personalfour-day visitto India, met with Modi at his residence in New Delhi and the two leaders “reviewed and positively assessed the progress in various areas of bilateral cooperation,” Modi’s office said in a statement. They also “welcomed the significant progress” in the negotiations of an expected trade deal between the two countries, the statement said. The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aiming to seal a bilateral trade agreement this year. They have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well. The deal “presents an opportunity to negotiate a new and modern trade agreement focused on promoting job creation and citizen well-being in both countries, with the goal of enhancing bilateral trade and supply-chain integration in a balanced and mutually beneficial manner,” Vance’s office said in a statement. Vance’s first visit to New Delhi came amid the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump’snow-paused tariff programagainst most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between the United States and China, which is New Delhi’s main rival in the region. AP correspondent Jennifer King reports Vice President JD Vance is on a personal and diplomatic trip to India.  Modi’s office said that the two leaders “noted continued efforts towards enhancing cooperation in energy, defense, strategic technologies and other areas” and “exchanged views on various regional and global issues of mutual interest, and called for dialogue and diplomacy as the way forward.” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Monday that Vance’s visit will “further deepen the India–U.S. comprehensive global strategic partnership.” Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi’s Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome, wherehe met with Pope Francison Easter Sunday, a day before the pontiff’s death. Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their three children and officials from the U.S. administration. The family visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort — a UNESCO world heritage site — during their trip. India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region. It was also part of the Quad, which is made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China’s expansion in the region. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year. Washington has long sought to develop a deeper partnership with New Delhi, which is seen as a bulwark against China. Modi particularly established a goodworking relationshipwith Trump during his first term in office, and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries. Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. Duringhis visit, he hailed a “mega partnership” with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump’s tariffs. The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration’s demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S. Modi also has cooperated with Trump’s moves to deport migrants as India has accepted many of its citizens from the U.S. in the past few months. Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a “tariff abuser” and “tariff king.” The trade negotiations are especially urgent for India, which could be hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors. Harsh Vardhan Shringla, India’s former foreign secretary and ambassador to the U.S., said that Vance’s visit comes at a time of global upheaval in world trade. He said ties between New Delhi and Washington could see an upsurge under Trump’s presidency, mainly in technology-sharing and defense. “U.S. trade policy under Trump offers an opportunity for India to embed itself in a bigger way in the U.S. markets and global supply chains,” Shringla said. Modi’s government is also hoping to attract investment from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Last month, Musk’s Starlinkentered into agreementswith two of India’s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services. Musk also indicated that he would visit India later this year after speaking last week with Modi, signaling that there could be progress in the electric carmaker’s push to enter the Indian market. India is also a major defense partner of the U.S. It has in recent years embedded advanced American jets, helicopters, missiles and military gear into its armed forces. The two countries have announced plans to sign a 10-year framework later this year for strengthening their defense partnership. ___ Rajesh Roy contributed to this report.",Politics,1
US Supreme Court won’t revive a Minnesota ban on gun-carry permits for young adults,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-guns-minnesota-michigan-students-26b9c4a6bb685d675e7adf6cd5eaf23c,AP News,,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — TheSupreme Courton Monday rejected an appeal from Minnesota asking to revive the state’sban on gun-carry permits for young adults. The justices also left in place aban on gunsat the University of Michigan, declining to hear an appeal from a man who argued he has a right to be armed on campus. No justice noted a dissent in either case. Taken together, the actions reflect the high court’s apparent lack of appetite for cases that further explore the constitutional right to “keep and bear arms.” The court has repeatedly turned away gun cases since its 2022 ruling thatexpanded gun rightsand a clarifying 2024 decision thatupheld a federal gun control lawthat is intended to protect victims of domestic violence. The decision not to hear the Minnesota case was somewhat surprising because both sides sought the Supreme Court’s review and courts around the country have come to different conclusions about whether states can limit the gun rights of people aged 18 to 20 without violating the Constitution. The federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled that the Minnesota ban conflicted with the Second Amendment, which the court noted sets no age limit and generally protects ordinary, law-abiding young adults. In January, the federal appeals court in New Orleans struck down a federal law requiring young adults to be 21 to buy handguns. In February, a federal judge declined to block Hawaii’s ban on gun possession for people under 21.",Politics,1

A person familiar with the contents and those who received the messages, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, confirmed the second chat to The Associated Press. The second chat on Signal — which is acommercially available appnot authorized to be used to communicate sensitive or classified national defense information — included 13 people, the person said. The person also confirmed the chat was dubbed “Defense ' Team Huddle.” U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth speaks during the Central American Security Conference in Panama City, April 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Matias Delacroix, file)  The New York Times reported that the group included Hegseth’s wife, Jennifer, who is a former Fox News producer, and his brotherPhil Hegseth, who was hired at the Pentagonas a Department of Homeland Security liaison and senior adviser. Both have traveled with the defense secretary and attended high-level meetings. The White House and Pentagon said late Sunday that disgruntled former employees were spreading false claims. “No matter how many times the legacy media tries to resurrect the same non-story, they can’t change the fact that no classified information was shared,” said Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary. “Recently-fired ‘leakers’ are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the President’s agenda, but the administration will continue to hold them accountable.”  Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell added ina post on Xlate Sunday that the report “relied only on the words of people who were fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage the Secretary and the President’s agenda. There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.” The revelation of the additional chat group brought new calls for Hegseth to be ousted as President Donald Trump’s administration has faced criticism forfailing to take actionso far against the top national security officials who discussed plans for the military strike in Signal. “The details keep coming out. We keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk. But Trump is still too weak to fire him,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumerposted on X. “Pete Hegseth must be fired.” The first chat, set up by national security adviser Mike Waltz, included a number of Cabinet members andcame to lightbecause Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was added to the group.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  The contents of that chat, which The Atlantic published, shows that Hegseth listed weapons systems and a timeline for the attack on Iran-backedHouthis in Yemenlast month. Hegseth has previously contended that no classified information or war plans were shared in the chat with the journalist. The Times reported Sunday that the second chat had the same warplane launch times that the first chat included. Multiple former and current officials have said sharing those operational details before a strike would have certainly been classified and their release could have put pilots in danger. Hegseth’s use of Signal and the sharing of such plans are underinvestigation by the Defense Department’s acting inspector general. It came at the request of the leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee — Republican Chairman Roger Wicker of Mississippi and ranking Democratic member Jack Reed of Rhode Island. Reed urged the Pentagon watchdog late Sunday to probe the reported second Signal chat as well, saying that Hegseth “must immediately explain why he reportedly texted classified information that could endanger American servicemembers’ lives.” “I have grave concerns about Secretary Hegseth’s ability to maintain the trust and confidence of U.S. servicemembers and the Commander-in-Chief,” he added. The new revelations come during further turmoil at the Pentagon. Four officials in Hegseth’s inner circle departed last week as the Pentagon conducts a widespread investigation for information leaks. Dan Caldwell, a Hegseth aide; Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg; and Darin Selnick, Hegseth’s deputy chief of staff,were escorted out of the Pentagon. While the three initially had been placed on leave pending the investigation, ajoint statement shared by Caldwellon X on Saturday said the three “still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with.” Caldwell was the staff member designated as Hegseth’s point person in theSignal chatwith Trump Cabinet members. Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot also announced he was resigning last week, unrelated to the leaks. The Pentagon said, however, that Ullyot was asked to resign. ___ AP writer Michelle L.

South Carolina Senate seek at hearing to remove state treasurer over $1.8B accounting error,https://apnews.com/article/south-carolina-accounting-error-treasurer-loftis-senate-a8ce19b3c42f63d96ee042e26874be32,AP News,Jeffrey Collins,21-04-25,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina’s Republican-dominated Senate and its elected Republican treasurer faced off Monday in an extraordinary hearing as senators try to kick the treasurerout of officeover a $1.8 billion accounting error. The hearing is the culmination of over two years of investigation by the Senate that started when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion. That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn’t balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousand of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grewto $1.8 billion. It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the $1.8 billion wasnot real moneybut just an accumulation of errors. The two Republican senators calling for Loftis to be kicked out of office said he canno longer be trustedto handle South Carolina’s bank accounts. They charged that he is incompetent and never reported the mistakes to lawmakers as required by law while refusing to take accountability. “He’s a liar that was so concerned with his public appearance that he would do and say anything to cover up his mistake,” Sen. Stephen Goldfinch said.  Loftis has called the Senate investigation awitch hunt. He repeatedly saidno money went missingand the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state’s strong credit rating. His lawyer Deborah Barbier opened the treasurer’s three-hour case with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump on a screen. She pointed out that he has won election four times and will face voters again in a primary in 14 months. Loftis has previously said he would not run for reelection. “The people don’t want to be told that you are better than them,” Barbier said from a temporary lectern at the back of the state Senate chamber. “Let issues like this be decided at the ballot box.” Senators can ask questions at the end of the hearing. The Senate would need a two-thirds vote to decide Loftis committed “willful neglect of duty” and send the matter to the House, which must also hold its own two-thirds vote to remove the treasurer. Thirty-one of the 40 senators present on Monday will have to vote against Loftis to keep the process going. No office holder has been removed in this way since South Carolina became a state 225 years ago. Republican leaders in the House have given no indication whether they will take up the matter. The books still haven’t been fully straightened out, and accountants continue to struggle with Loftis’ office and how they handle the state’s bank accounts, Grooms said. The treasurer is trying anything to protect his 14 years in office and reputation as a competent conservative steward who is always looking out for taxpayers, Grooms said. “Because of his failures, the self-proclaimed best friend of the taxpayer is costing the taxpayers tens of millions in legal, auditing and oversight fees,” Grooms said. “With friends like this, who needs tax-and-spend liberals.” A Senate subcommitteeheld hearingsto question Loftis under oath. They have been contentious. Loftis has slammed papers, accused senators of a witch hunt and threatened to get up and leave. He did not show any outward signs of frustration or anger as the hearing started Monday.",Politics,1
"FACT FOCUS: Examining RFK Jr.'s claims about measles, autism and diet as head of HHS",https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103,AP News,,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — In just two months as the federal health secretary,Robert F. Kennedy Jr.has made sweeping changes to the Department of Health and Human Services — and its priorities. He’s dismissed10,000 public health workers, met with state governors who want to restrict unhealthy foods in taxpayer-funded programs and delivered an inconsistent message on vaccines as measles outbreaks across the country have sickened hundreds. Last week, he promised to find some of the causes of rising U.S.autism ratesin under six months’ time. Kennedy’s followers — a contingent of health-conscious moms, Republicans loyal to President Donald Trump and others — have celebrated his “Make America Healthy Again” initiatives. But scientists and public health experts have expressed dismay over some of Kennedy’s statements about Americans’ diets,vaccines,measlesandautism. Here’s a look at some of those claims Kennedy has made, with additional context and facts. KENNEDY, at a news conference Wednesday: Studies show that autism rates in the U.S. were “1 in 10,000 when I was a kid” compared to a recent U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that found it to be 1 in 31. He says that is evidence of an autism epidemic in the U.S. and that, “we know it’s an environmental exposure. It has to be.” THE FACTS: It’s true that in the 20th century, only 1 in 10,000 children were diagnosed with autism —- the diagnosis was rare and given only to kids with severe problems communicating or socializing and those with unusual, repetitive behaviors. But the term became shorthand for a group of milder, related conditions known as ″autism spectrum disorders,” and the number of kids labeled as having some form of autism began to balloon.  The term “epidemic” is widely used to describe surges in different health problems — like autism, obesity and gun violence, to name a few. But strictly speaking, “epidemic” is defined as a fast-spreading outbreak of disease, and there’s not good evidence that autism meets that definition. Health officials have largely attributed growing autism numbers to better recognition of cases, through wide screening and better diagnosis. Last week, the CDC saiddiagnosis rate is up to 1 in 31 children. There are no blood or biologic tests for autism; it is diagnosed by making judgments about a child’s behavior. Research has looked at a variety of other possible explanations, including genetics, the age of the father, the weight of the mother and chemicals in the environment. Prior to his rise to health secretary, Kennedy joined anti-vaccine advocates in claiming childhood vaccines are responsible for autism, but studies by the CDC and others have ruled that out. A fraudulent single study that claimed a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine was later retracted by the journal that published it. Kennedy recently announced a major study into the cause of autism and told an April 10 Cabinet meeting: “By September we will know what has caused the autism epidemic and we’ll be able to eliminate those exposures.” But last week, he softened that to having ”some of the answers by September.” — Mike Stobbe and Devi Shastri KENNEDY, in interview with Sean Hannity that aired on Fox News on March 11: “There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year. It causes — it causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera. And so people ought to be able to make that choice for themselves.” THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is safe and its risks are lower than the risks of complications from measles. There have been no documented deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people, according to theInfectious Diseases Society of America. Most people who get the MMR vaccine have no serious problems from it, theCDC says. The most common side effects are mild: a sore arm, fever, mild rash and temporary joint pain or stiffness in teenage or adult women who don’t already have rubella immunity. There is a very small risk of febrile seizures that increases as infants get older, which is why the shot is recommended as early as possible. Some people can have allergic reactions; people allergic to the antibiotic neomycin should not get the shot,according to the CDC. — Devi Shastri KENNEDY, in an April interview with CBS: “We’re always going to have measles, no matter what happens, as the (MMR) vaccine wanes very quickly.” THE FACTS: The measles vaccine is highly protective and lasts a lifetime for most people. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the virus,according to the CDC and medical experts worldwide.Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some3 million to 4 million casesper year. Now, it’s usually fewer than 200 in a normal year. Usually, most measles cases come to the U.S. from abroad. This is why high vaccination rates are important. When 95% or more people are vaccinated, entire communities are considered protected from the virus, which is important for people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues. — Devi Shastri KENNEDY, in a CBS interview posted April 9, discussing death of 8-year-old child in Texas who had measles: “The thing that killed (her) was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection.” THE FACTS: Two children in Texas have died — both from measles complications, according to the Texas State Department of Health and Human Services. The state health department has made clear that the children were not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Doctors at University Medical Center in Lubbock who treated the 8-year-old said she died of “measles pulmonary failure.” Claiming that patients die of complications and not the actual disease that led to them is a tactic that anti-vaccine advocates have used to undermine Texas health experts since the first child died of measles in March — and in other outbreaks before that. It’s also a talking point that Kennedy, who spent20 yearsas one of the world’s leading anti-vaccine activists,continues to amplify. Measles complications can include pneumonia, brain swelling and other respiratory or neurological complications, which can lead to death in 1 to 3 of every 1,000 children who are infected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. —-Devi Shastri KENNEDY, in April 6 in an X post,said twoTexas doctors“have treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.” THE FACTS: Pediatricians note there is no cure for measles: It is a virus that the body has to fight off on its own. The best way to protect against the risks of measles is to get vaccinated to lower the chance of contracting it. Budesonide is a steroid used in different forms to treat asthma, ulcerative colitis and other conditions. Clarithromycin is an antibiotic; it fights bacteria, not viruses. Neither drug is recommended for treating measles — the use is “risky and unproven” —the American Academy of Pediatrics says. “There are no miracle cures for measles,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, who chairs the academy’s Committee on Infectious Diseases,recently said in a fact check on the organization’s website. “If your child becomes sick with measles, doctors will do everything we can to care for them, but the truth is we do not have effective treatments against this viral infection.” —-Devi Shastri KENNEDY, at an April 15 event in Indianapolis, said 70% of Americans are obese or overweight, compared to 3% of Americans during President John F. Kennedy’s tenure in the early 1960s. THE FACTS: Nearly three-quarters of Americans are overweight, including about 40% with obesity, according torecent figuresfrom the CDC. Between 1960 and 1962, about 13% of people in the U.S. had obesity, according to historic CDC data. The rise in obesity in the U.S. and other developed countries in recent decades has been well-documented and studied. Experts say there is no single explanation for the increase, but that it stems from a combination of factors, including biological and environmental contributors, an increase in available calories and a decline in physical activity. Changes in the food supply, including the development of high-calorie, cheap ultraprocessed foods have been linked to obesity, butexactly how these foodsaffect weight gain remains unclear. KENNEDY at April 10 cabinet meeting regarding food dyes: “We’ve shown now that this directly affects academic performance, violence in the schools, and mental health, as well as physical health.” THE FACTS:Recent researchshows synthetic food colors common in U.S. foods are linked to neurobehavioral problems in children and that the dyes may cause or exacerbate symptoms, particularly hyperactivity. In addition, children may vary widely in their sensitivity to the dyes. “It is clear that some children are likely to be more adversely affected by food dyes than others,” researchers in California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment reported in 2021. Those responses have the potential to affect school work and behaviors such as aggression, but to date there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship between food dyes and academic performance, violence or other mental and physical conditions, scientists say. To date, scientific evidence shows that “most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the dyes. KENNEDY on March 28 during a speech in West Virginia to encourage restrictions to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program: “Twenty years ago, there was no diabetes in China. Today 50% of the population is diabetic.” THE FACTS: Diabetes prevalence has gone up in China over the past two decades, driven by rising living standards, urbanization and an aging population. About 6.1% of the population had diabetes in 2001-2002, according to a2005 analysis. But that has only grown to to 12.4%, according to latest data included in aLancet reportin 2024. — JoNel Aleccia ___ AP reporter Amanda Seitz in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"Dominick Ruggerio, Rhode Island’s longest-serving legislator, dies at 76",https://apnews.com/article/dominick-ruggerio-rhode-island-senate-died-cancer-1d298538b385c07a110679df71e5ef9f,AP News,,21-04-25,"Dominick Ruggerio, Rhode Island’s longest-serving legislator at nearly 44 years and its Senate president since 2017, died Monday, his office said. He was 76. Ruggerio, a Democrat, died at Fatima Hospital in North Providence, said Greg Pare, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Senate. He was hospitalized last week. Ruggerio announced last April that he was receiving treatment for cancer, but he still sought reelection to the Senate and won in November. In a statement, Gov. Dan McKee, a fellow Democrat, called Ruggerio “a great friend and true public servant who dedicated his life to lifting up the state he loved.” McKee said Ruggerio “will always be remembered for his unwavering commitment to supporting working families and strengthening Rhode Island’s economy.” He directed U.S. and Rhode Island state flags to be flown at half-staff at all state facilities and buildings through the day of Ruggerio’s internment. U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, both Democrats, expressed their condolences. “I will miss Donny’s friendship and his unwavering advocacy for our state and the people who make it a special place,” Reed said in a statement. ”Rhode Island is better today because of Senate President Ruggerio’s leadership and dedication.” Ruggerio was first elected to the House in 1980, where he served two terms before joining the Senate. He had been Senate majority leader before becoming president. As the chamber’s most senior member, he was referred to as its “dean.” He represented District 4, which includes parts of North Providence and Providence.  His legislative biography says he co-sponsored initiatives to “make it easy to do business in Rhode Island by reforming the income tax code, cutting red tape, improving access to capital, and building the skills of the workforce.” Ruggerio was a big advocate for legalized sports betting in Rhode Island, which started in 2018. He also was a leader on legislation requiring that the state be powered completely by renewable energy by 2033. McKee signed the measure into law in 2022. “It will keep Rhode Island, home to the nation’s first offshore wind farm, on the forefront of renewable energy innovation. And it will help us harness the power of clean energy as a driver of economic growth and opportunity,” Ruggerio said in a statement at the time. Ruggerio also successfully sponsored bills to address the opioid epidemic. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network said Ruggerio “championed efforts to improve public health and increase access to lifesaving cancer screening tests.” It inducted him into its Rhode Island Cancer Caucus in 2022. Ruggerio, who was anti-abortion, did not support legislation to preserve federal abortion protections in state law. But he said he was determined not to impose his personal views on other Senate members. Lawmakers passed the bill. Before joining the General Assembly, Ruggerio was a policy aide for the Office of the Lieutenant Governor from 1977 to 1981. He was an administrator for the New England Laborers Labor Management Coop Trust. Valarie Lawson, Senate Majority Leader, said Monday at a news conference that the Senate will be canceling all its business “until further notice.” “As many of you know, whether you agreed with him or not on an issue, his door was always open,” she said. “Many times he put is own point of view aside to listen to the members of this chamber and for the good of the Senate chamber he loved.”",Politics,1
"With the border quiet, Texas ponders spending another $6.5 billion on border security",https://apnews.com/us-news/greg-abbott-texas-donald-trump-donald-trump-es-border-security-d385d014aeb0c66c4bc07674228a5104,AP News,,21-04-25,"Texas’ massive, multibillion-dollar mission to reinforce its border with Mexico helped Terrell County Sheriff Thaddeus Cleveland hire two full-time deputies and three part-timers. It gave him the money to buy equipment and new vehicles. In the lawman’s words, it “kept us alive” as the number of illegal border crossings skyrocketed under the Biden administration torecord highs. And Cleveland, who became sheriff after 26 years as a Border Patrol agent, still has needs. He said he hopes and prays to be able to hire more deputies. But he also has worries about the state plowing billions of more taxpayer dollars into border security as the border gets quieter and quieter — and President Donald Trump vows mass deportations of undocumented immigrants living throughout the country. “With President Trump being in the White House, I would foresee the federal government spending more money. The state Legislature surely shouldn’t have to spend that much more money,” he said in an interview. “Why are we asking (for) that?” Three hundred and thirty-five miles east of Terrell County, state lawmakers and leaders in Austin areasking for just that. As the Legislature irons out the details of thestate’s spending planfor the next two years, $6.5 billion for border security has sailed through both chambers with little fanfare. Meanwhile, the number of arrests along the border hasdwindled to a trickleand the federal government has begun expanding its immigration enforcement apparatus to deport as many people as Trump promised on the campaign trail.  If approved, the appropriation would increase the tab for the state’s border security spending to nearly $18 billion since 2021, when Gov.Greg Abbottbegan the state’s own crackdown,Operation Lone Star, in response to the Biden administration’s immigration policies. That new sum would be more than five times the $3.4 billion that state lawmakers spent on border security over the 14 preceding years, when lawmakers began regularly allocating money for border operations. “It’s hard to make the argument that the politics around immigration and the border have ever been especially preoccupied with good governance,” said Jim Henson, who directs the Texas Politics Project at UT Austin. Theproject’s December poll, after the presidential election, found that 45% of Texas voters felt the state was spending too little on border security. That number increased to 63% among only Republican voters. “If you’re trying to balance good governance and some semblance of fiscal responsibility with politics on this issue, as a Republican legislator or a Republican elected official, the politics are still weighing very heavily on that scale,” Henson said. At various points in the last four years, Abbott has said the state must maintain its presence — and spending — along the border until it achieved “operational control” of the border. “Texas will not stop until we gain full operational control of the border,” Abbottsaid in Junewhen he welcomed troops to a new military base the statebuilt in Eagle Pass. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last month that the nation is close to reaching that goal. U.S. Customs and Border Protection “literally has almost 100% operational control (of) the border which means that our country is secure and that we know who’s coming into this country,”Noem told NewsNation. In a statement, Abbott Press Secretary Andrew Mahaleris noted that the state devoted money to border security before 2021. “Gov. Abbott will continue working with the Legislature to determine appropriate funding levels,” Mahaleris said. “This funding is critical to ensure Texas can continue working closely with President Trump and his administration to protect our state and nation.” State Sen.Joan Huffman, a Houston Republican who is a lead writer of the state budget, also appeared open to the idea of redirecting the money currently earmarked for border security. She said she was closely monitoring illegal crossings and the flow of drugs and weapons with the governor’s office, state leadership and state police “in order to determine the appropriate level of state support required to fully secure the border and keep Texans safe.” In a statement to the Tribune, Huffman said Texas “is undoubtedly benefiting from the Trump Administration’s focus on reinstating security at our southern border. … It is essential that the state uses taxpayer funds prudently and in coordination with the federal government’s ongoing efforts.” But it’s not clear how much appetite there is to make a change to the state’s recent multi-billion-dollar border commitment. During a budget debate in the House last week, Rep.Ana-María Rodríguez Ramos, D-Richardson,unsuccessfully tried to shiftthe border security budget to give Texas teachers a pay increase. “We could give you a trillion dollars, and you would still cry with this red meat nonsense,” Rodríguez Ramos said. A few weeks ago, State Sen.Sarah Eckhardt, an Austin Democrat who serves on the upper chamber’s border security committee, went to Del Rio to check out the state’s military operations, the international port and Operation Lone Star staging. When she toured the Rio Grande, she said a tent set up to book people arrested under Operation Lone Star held a lone individual — a U.S. citizen from Texas accused of a crime, she said. Eckhardt said in an interview that the $6.5 billion currently being considered might not even cover the cost of some immigration-related proposals that lawmakers are now considering. She pointed to apotential prohibition on granting bailto undocumented immigrants accused of felonies — which could increase the costs for the local government if it is not allowed by the state to release the individual. “We are shifting the cost of Trump’s goal onto state and local taxes,” Eckhardt said. Selene Rodriguez, a border and immigration expert for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, said the state will always have a role to play in border security. But she would like more transparency when it comes to spending. “I myself am a big proponent of increased public safety efforts because I believe that is one of the few legitimate roles of government,” Rodriguez said. “But if you’re going to do it, do it correctly. Line the pockets appropriately, and if you don’t need 5,000 Guardsmen at the border maybe don’t have them there.” At least two bills this session called for auditing Operation Lone Star. Both bills, one in each chamber, were referred to committee. As of mid-April, neither had received a hearing. ___ This story was originally published byThe Texas Tribuneand distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",Politics,1
Feds give NY another month to stop Manhattan congestion toll after state ignored latest deadline,https://apnews.com/article/manhattan-congestion-pricing-trump-new-york-toll-03dc6457f743b856e764dcf20f4f1855,AP News,Philip Marcelo,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration has given New York another month to cease its congestion toll after the stateignored a Sunday deadlineto shut down the $9 fee for most drivers coming into the busiest part of Manhattan. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, in aMonday letterto New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, said the state risks losing federal funding and approvals for certain projects from the Federal Highway Administration. The missive gives New York officials another 30 days to stop collecting the toll — or at least explain why they’re not breaking the law by continuing with the program after the governmentrevoked its federal approvalin February. “The federal government sends billions to New York — but we won’t foot the bill if Governor Hochul continues to implement an illegal toll to backfill the budget of New York’s failing transit system,” Duffy said in a statement after issuing the letter. “We are giving New York one last chance to turn back or prove their actions are not illegal.” Hochul’s office didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Spokespersons for the Democrat and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency overseeing the tolls, confirmed Sunday that its system of traffic cameras continues to collect the fee assessed on most cars entering the borough below Central Park. The fee, whichbegan Jan. 5, is meant to reduce traffic jams and raise billions of dollars in revenue for New York’s subways, commuter trains and public buses.  But President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker whose namesake Trump Tower and other properties are within the congestion zone, had vowed to kill the plan as soon as he took office. After first rescinding federal approval earlier this year, Duffy called the program “a slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners,” and initially gave New Yorkuntil March 21to stop charging the toll. The MTA challenged Duffy’s decision in federal court and Duffy subsequentlypushed the deadlineback by a month, to April 20. Thetoll variesdepending on type of vehicle and time of day and comes on top of tolls drivers already pay to cross bridges and tunnels into Manhattan. Drivers of most passenger cars pay $9 to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25 for most vehicles. Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have long had similar fees to reduce traffic congestion. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo attwitter.com/philmarcelo.",Politics,1
Georgia Democrat Jason Esteves says he’s running for governor in 2026,https://apnews.com/article/jason-esteves-governor-democrat-georgia-2026-b9cfa30b2fab7f5de5ef749a1db4c0de,AP News,Jeff Amy,21-04-25,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Democrat Jason Esteves announced on Monday that he’s running for governor in 2026, entering a field that remains murky for his party after two top potential candidates backed away from a run. The 41-year-old state senator, also a lawyer and business owner, remains largely unknown outside his state Senate district, which includes parts of Fulton and Cobb counties. An early announcement could help him to raise money and increase his visibility. He’s likely to emphasize his biography, including his young children and his past service as a public school teacher. Esteves has also served as treasurer of the state Democratic Party, giving him a network among Democratic activists. In a videoannouncing his candidacy, Esteves sounded a note of opposition to Republican President Donald Trump while saying he would emphasize lowering the cost of living, including housing costs, as well as expanding health care, restoring abortion rights and increasing funding for schools. “I’m running for Governor to make Georgia the number one place to work, start a business, and raise a family,” Esteves said in a statement. “As extreme politicians in Georgia push Trump’s reckless agenda and rig the system for special interests, Georgians pay the price.” Incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is term-limited after two terms and can’t seek reelection in 2026. FormerAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottomshas said she plans to run for governor as a Democrat, but has not yet filed papers to create a campaign. Former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond has also expressed interest, and two-timenominee Stacey Abramscould yet choose to run again.  On the Republican side,Attorney General Chris Carrannounced his run for governor last year andLt. Gov. Burt Jonesis expected to announce his candidacy soon. Esteves enters the race as two potential Democratic candidates step back to focus on family health concerns. Former state Sen. Jason Carter, Democrats’ 2014 nominee and grandson of the late former President Jimmy Carter, said he has no plans to seek the 2026 nomination because of his wife’s cancer diagnosis. Kate Carter has glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. The couple has two teenage sons. “For all intents and purposes, I can’t imagine making a decision to run because it’s the wrong time for my family,” Carter, 49, told The Associated Press on Monday. U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath announced on March 31 that she was suspending her exploratory bid for governor in 2026, saying she needed to focus on her husband Curtis’ health after complications from cancer surgery. The four-term member of Congress, best known as a gun control advocate, hadfiled papers on March 5to raise money for governor. Carter has been mentioned as a centrist candidate with high name identification who could run as a bridge between the Democrats’ base and voters who might be up for grabs if President Donald Trump’s popularity and the Republican brand take a dip heading into 2026. An Atlanta attorney who has been out of politics since losing the2014 governor’s race, Carter has drawn renewed attention in recent years as Carter Center board chairman and family spokesperson as his grandparents’ health declined.He eulogized his grandfatherin January at the 39th president’s state funeral in Washington and did the same for his grandmother, Rosalynn Carter, at her Atlanta funeral in December 2023. The younger Carter said he’s “not going to endorse anybody,” but added, “I’m very excited about Jason (Esteves)” and what he can offer voters and the party. Esteves first won election to the state Senate in 2022 after nine years on the Atlanta school board. He was chair of the board for four years, including part of the time that the distict was heavily impacted by COVID-19. He touts increased graduation rates and higher pay for staff during that time, but some parents were displeased with how long it took the district to resume in-person classes. While Esteves was leading the board, it also decided not to renewSuperintendent Meria Carstarphen’scontract, which causes a stir among those who supported Carstarphen’s leadership following the school district’s cheating scandal. Esteves and his wife, Ariel, own Flying Biscuit restaurants in Macon and Columbus, Esteves’ hometown. He and his wife also own an urgent and primary care clinic. They have two children. ___ Associated Press writer Bill Barrow contributed to this report.",Politics,1
"Trump renews attack on Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dow Jones tumbles 1,000 points",https://apnews.com/article/inflation-trump-powell-federal-reserve-6eb45ff17915b321366dbe1c5bb15e43,AP News,Christopher Rugaber,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeated hisattacksMonday against the chair of the Federal Reserve, demanding that the central bank lower its key interest rate to boost the economy. TrumpcalledPowell “a major loser” and said that energy and grocery prices are “substantially lower” and “there is virtually No Inflation.” Yet Trump said the economy could slow without rate cuts. Gas prices have fallen for the past two months, in part because oil costs have dropped on fears of slower growth, butfood pricesjumped in January and March andoverall inflationremains above the Fed’s 2% target. Trump’s comments drovethe stock market and the dollar loweras investors in the U.S. and overseas grow increasingly wary about the economic standing of the U.S. On Friday, a top White House adviser said the administration is studying whether it can fire Powell, a move that would undermine the Fed’s independence and likely send shock waves through global financial markets. The stock market, which fell immediately at the opening bell Monday, tumbled further after Trump’s post, with Dow dropping by more than 1,000 points and the broad S&P 500 stock index falling nearly 3% in mid-day trading. The dollar fell to a three-year low. The Federal Reserve was established as an independent agency and most economists think central banks that are free of political interferencedo a better job at keeping inflation in check. Otherwise, it would be harder for the Fed to take unpopular steps to keep prices down, such as raising interest rates.  The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries has been rising as Trump rolled out aggressive tariff policies against trading partners and continues to attack Powell and the Federal Reserve. The interest rate ticked higher again on Monday to 4.37%. The dollar losing value isunusualwhen stock prices fall and Treasury yields rise because investors typically buy U.S. government bonds during market turmoil, driving down the yield. Instead, investors appear to be avoiding U.S. markets due to the perception of rising risk. Trump also criticized Powell for being “too late” to move on interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have long acknowledged that they waited too long to raise rates when inflation was first ignited in 2021. But right now, Powell hasunderscoredthat the Fed faces a potentially “challenging scenario.” Trump’s tariffs could worsen inflation, and the Fed would typically respond to rising prices by keeping its rate elevated, or even raising it. Yet the economy could also slow because of the duties, which the Fed would normally seek to counter with rate cuts. “Our tool only does one of those two things at the same time,” Powell said last week. As a result, Powell has underscored that the Fed will stay on the sidelines as it waits to see how the tariff policies play out. Trumplashed out at Powell on Fridayand said he could fire him if he wanted, though it would likely touch off a legal battle that could go to the Supreme Court. Powell has said the presidentlacks the authorityto fire him and has made clear he won’t step down until his term ends in May 2026. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, when asked Friday whether firing Powell is an option, said that Trump “and his team will continue to study that matter.” Hassett also accused Powell of acting politically. Trump made a similar claim in his Truth Social post, accusing the Fed chair of cutting rates last year “in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected.” The Fed reduced its key rate three times in late 2024 as inflation cooled and out of concern that hiring was also slowing, though it later rebounded. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and added that, “I don’t think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.” “The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,” he said. Also Sunday, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve’s Chicago branch, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that undermining the Federal Reserve’s independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and less hiring. And William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, said Trump’s attacks on the Fed aren’t “going to make the American people better off over time.” “They’ll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,” he said.",Politics,1
Iowa considers whether to change constitution to address how traumatized witnesses testify in court,https://apnews.com/article/iowa-confrontation-clause-child-victims-d85cc8982508414a8e95290fbfcaa7d5,AP News,Hannah Fingerhut,21-04-25,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Iowa’s top prosecutor is proposing an amendment to the state constitution to solve what one lawmaker called an “interesting conundrum,” weighing a person’s constitutional right to confront their accuser in the courtroom against the desire to protect traumatized children and vulnerable people. But some worry the proposal could hinder a defendant’s rights in court. The Iowa House approved the measure last week, and it passed the Senate in March, though it would take years and several more votes — by lawmakers and the public — before the state constitution could be changed. The issue stems from a state Supreme Court decision last year that said the Iowa Constitution requires people accused of a crime and the trial witnesses testifying against them to see each other. The decision broke with decades of how the U.S. Supreme Court and other states handle the issue, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird argues. “We are the only state that has come to that conclusion,” said Bird, a Republican. “It’s really important that we can protect kids in court, that kids who have been traumatized can have the opportunity to testify outside the presence of the person they may be very, very afraid of.” The amendment would say that constitutional right “may be limited by law” for certain witnesses: those under 18 and those with mental illness, intellectual disability or other developmental disability. Both legislative chambers would need to approve the measure again in 2027 or 2028 to put it before voters in November 2028. The Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution lays out the rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions, specifying the right to a speedy trial, an impartial jury, and, among other things, “to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” The Iowa Constitution, adopted in 1857, also defines the rights of persons accused, including the same confrontation clause. The U.S. Supreme Court said in a 1990 decision, Maryland v. Craig, that “the right to confront accusatory witnesses may be satisfied absent a physical, face-to-face confrontation” when remote testimony is necessary and can be provided reliably. “Maryland’s interest in protecting child witnesses from the trauma of testifying in a child abuse case is sufficiently important to justify the use of its special procedure,” the decision said. The majority of courts across the country have aligned with that Supreme Court decision, according to Colin Miller, a University of South Carolina law professor. The most common exception is when the state’s confrontation clause includes the words “face to face.” That explicit text led the New Hampshire Supreme Court this year, for example, to say a 9-year-old girl’s remote testimony violated the defendant’s constitutional right. “Up until Iowa, our — as practitioners and as a national agency — operating assumption was that if it did not say ‘face to face’ in the state constitution, they would abide Maryland v. Craig,” said Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute at Lewis & Clark Law School. Garvin was referencing the Iowa Supreme Court’s decision last year that reversed the convictions for a man accused of neglect or abuse of a child and child endangerment causing bodily injury. Two of his other children testified against him from outside the courtroom, where they could not see the defendant. A 1998 state law carved out that exception for a minor needing protection “from trauma caused by testifying in the physical presence of the defendant where it would impair the minor’s ability to communicate.” If the judge allows, a minor’s testimony could be televised to the jury and defendant in the courtroom. Iowa’s confrontation clause does not specify “face to face,” but the court said that violated his constitutional right to confrontation, declaring the state constitution affords more protection to criminal defendants than the federal constitution. “When our constitution was adopted, a ‘confrontation’ was understood to involve a ‘face to face’ encounter,” the court said. Bird said her office wanted to ensure the solution they proposed to protect kids “stands the test of time.” It’s supported by law enforcement and county attorneys, as well as various victim advocacy organizations, many of whom told lawmakers that justice isn’t being served in Iowa if children are forced to face an abuser again or are too afraid to tell their stories. “The thing that I sit almost daily, definitely weekly, and grapple with with parents is when they have to decide: ‘Is the price of justice worth it for my child?’” Wendy Berkey, a family advocate at a Des Moines-area child protection center, told lawmakers in January. “Unfortunately, right now in Iowa the answer they often have is no.” The public opposition to the proposal has been concentrated among defense attorneys who cite examples of people wrongly accused and say these allowances for certain witnesses signal to the jury that the defendant is guilty. The existing law looks similar to the approach in many states, said Chris Wellborn, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. But Wellborn suggested that changing the constitution is a slippery slope. “They’re basically futzing around with the Sixth Amendment,” he said. “I would argue that’s a very dangerous road to go down because when you start saying we carve out exceptions for someone’s confrontational rights, do we also carve out exceptions for their right to present a defense?” Bird said the current law has “worked for years without controversy,” and she is not seeking additional legislation. But Wellborn’s concern was echoed by Republican state Rep. Charley Thomson, who said the provisions “open the door wide to mischief by future legislatures.” State Rep. Steven Holt acknowledged the constitutionality concerns but said the Iowa Supreme Court didn’t offer many options. “They struck it down but didn’t really give any guidance as to what we should do,” said Holt, a Republican. “They’ve left us with an interesting conundrum as we try to protect children in the courts against ... having to be traumatized again.”",Politics,1

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Anti-Trump resistance sees another leader in Van Hollen Van Hollen traveled 2,000 miles to El Salvador last week to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who had been living in Maryland and was wrongly deported as federal courts say he should be returned. Van Hollen did not secure his release. But by meeting with him, Van Hollen created a new sense of hope and momentum for Abrego Garcia's family and people opposed to President Donald Trump.  Van Hollen’s emergence in a critical national debate offers a fresh window into the Democratic Party's monthslong leadership carousel. Democrats have struggled to counter a series of Trump administration policies with far-reaching consequences, from slashing the federal workforce to stripping funding from universities, pushing back against court orders and launching a trade war that's rattling the global economy.  Democrats’ most visible elected leaders, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer, have lost the confidence of many progressive activists. That’s opened a void for people like Sen. Cory Booker, who delivered a record-breaking 25-hour speech on the Senate floor that briefly served as a rallying point for the frustrated anti-Trump movement.  Voters also have packed into rallies hosted by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who have launched a national “Stop Oligarchy” tour.  At the same time, potential 2028 presidential contenders such as Govs. Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer have gone the other way by downplaying their Trump criticism at times. Others, including Govs. Josh Shapiro and Wes Moore, have largely avoided stepping into the national debate.Read more. Of note: No stranger to national politics, Van Hollen perhaps has spent as much time shaping the political landscape during his two decades in Congress as fighting on its front lines, serving at times as head of both the House and Senate campaign arms. But this year, Van Hollen has been especially aggressive against Trump, co-hosting the first major rally against Trump and Elon Musk’s cuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development, and serving as a leading advocate against Trump's across-the-board cuts. Related reads➤ Alito's dissent in deportation case says justices rushed to block Trump The Supreme Court acted “literally in the middle of the night” and without sufficient explanation in blocking the Trump administration from deporting any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law, Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a sharp dissent that castigated the seven-member majority.  Joined by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, Alito said there was “dubious factual support” for granting the request in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union. The group contended that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart such removals under the Alien Enemies of 1798.  The majority did not provide a detailed explanation in the order early Saturday, as is typical, but the court previously said deportations could proceed only after those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals.  “Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law,” Alito said in the dissent released hours after the court’s intervention against Trump’s administration.Read more. Of note: The justices’ brief order directed the administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center “until further order of this court.” Alito said that “unprecedented” relief was “hastily and prematurely granted.” He wrote that it was not clear whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction at this stage of the case, saying that not all legal avenues had been played out in lower courts and the justices had not had the chance to hear the government's side.  The administration has filed paperwork urging the high court to reconsider its hold.

Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.  With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.Read more. Of note: Musk said last year that Trump’s budget cuts would cause a “temporary hardship” that would soon put the economy on stronger footing. One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses.  “It's a big burden that’s being placed on a narrow group of people,” said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. “It will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.""

Trump says gray skies for the White House Easter egg roll mean no worries about sunburn,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2026,AP News,Darlene Superville,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — PresidentDonald Trumpwelcomed tens of thousands of people Monday to theWhite House Easter egg roll, saying the overcast weather meant no one would have to worry about getting sunburned. He thanked the National Park Service for how “spiffy” everything looked. More than 40,000 people were expected to participate, he said. “Happy Easter to everyone,” the president said, flanked on the White House balcony by his wife, first ladyMelania Trump, and an Easter bunny mascot. “It was a beautiful day yesterday, and it’s a beautiful day today. We don’t have to worry about sunburn but ... it looks like it’s not going to be raining.” The president and first lady visited the egg roll area, where he blew a gold-tone whistle stamped with the presidential seal to start a few races. They also spent time at a station where kids wrote cards to service members. Melania Trump later read “Bunny with a Big Heart” at a reading area. It’s a story about a forgetful rabbit who gets injured, must stay in bed and learns to be kinder to his family. Wooden spoon-wielding children competed against each other to guide hard-boiled eggs dyed pink, blue, yellow and green across a patch of the lawn to a finish line. In some cases, eggs were lobbed into the air instead of rolled across the grass, and at least one wooden spoon went flying through the air. The participants included some of Trump’s grandchildren — son Don Jr.'s children.  At a special station promoting next year’s250th anniversary of America’s founding, kids and their families could sign a mini-Declaration of Independence or dress up as Founding Fathers. The daylong event featured multiple activity stations, live performances and story times. Trump gave a “special thank you” to his wife for her work organizing the annual event. “I also want to thank the National Park Service,” he said. “The job they do in making everything so beautiful and spiffy, and I’m very difficult when it comes to that. I will tell you, very very difficult. ... They have done an incredible job. You just have to look around and see” The American Egg Board, which has participated in the Easter egg roll for nearly 50 years and has been a lead sponsor for the past decade, donated 30,000 eggs that were hand-dyed by board staff and volunteers, said Emily Metz, board president and CEO. She said the board understands the frustration felt by egg farmers and consumers over the egg shortage caused by the spread of avian flu andhow expensive it’s become to buy a dozen. Metz said the 2,500 dozen eggs given to the White House were small and medium, sizes not typically sold by retailers, so they will not further strain the supply or contribute to even higher prices. Nearly 9 million dozen eggs are sold daily in the United States, she said. “We feel like we need to take a moment to celebrate where we can, and you cannot have Easter without eggs. And you cannot have the White House Easter egg roll withoutreal eggs,” Metz said in an interview. Trump also included topics that had little to do with Easter in his brief remarks, like recruitment gains for the military and police and fire departments. He also said religion was “coming back to America.” The egg roll is one of the oldest White House traditions. It dates to 1878 andthe presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, who opened the lawn to children after Congress banned them from rolling eggs on the grounds of the Capitol. Tickets for Monday’s event were distributed through a lottery.",Politics,1
Google faces off with US government in attempt to break up company in search monopoly case,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2027,AP News,Michael Liedtke,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Google is confronting an existential threat as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into an illegal monopoly. The drama began to unfold Monday in a Washington courtroom as three weeks of hearings kicked off to determine how the company should be penalized for operating a monopoly in search. In its opening arguments, federal antitrust enforcers also urged the court to impose forward-looking remedies to prevent Google from using artificial intelligence to further its dominance. “This is a moment in time, we’re at an inflection point, will we abandon the search market and surrender them to control of the monopolists or will we let competition prevail and give choice to future generations,” said Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a “remedy hearing,” are set to feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. Google’s attorney, John Schmidtlein, said in his opening statement that the court should take a much lighter touch. He said the government’s heavy-handed proposed remedies wouldn’t boost competition but instead unfairly reward lesser rivals with inferior technology.  “Google won its place in the market fair and square,” Schmidtlein said. The moment of reckoning comes four-and-a-half-years after the Justice Department fileda landmark lawsuitalleging Google’s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet’s main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade. After the case finally went to trial in 2023,a federal judge last year ruledGoogle had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software. That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google’s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998. Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers. Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that — no matter what occurs — Google always wins,” the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. “The American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.” Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden’s term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google’s immense power as a threat to freedom, too. In his opening statement, Dahlquist noted that top officials from the Justice Department were in the room to watch proceedings. He said their presence indicated that the case had the full support of federal antitrust regulators, both past and present. “The fact that this case was filed in 2020, tried in 2023, under two different administrations, and joined by 49 states demonstrates the non-partisan nature of this case and our proposed remedies,” Dahlquist said. Dahlquist also said that Mehta would be hearing a lot about AI — “perhaps more than you want, your honor,” — and said top executives from AI companies, like ChatGPT, would be called to testify. He said the court’s remedies should include provisions to make sure that Google’s AI product, Gemini, isn’t used to strengthen its existing search monopoly. “We believe that Google can and will attempt to circumvent the court’s remedies if it is not included,” Dahlquist said. “Gen AI is Google’s next evolution to keep their vicious cycle spinning.” Schmidtlein, Google’s attorney, said rival AI companies had seen enormous growth in recent years and were doing “just fine.” Google is also sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. “The breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers,” Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. The showdown over Google’s fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals. The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup — a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court. Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta’s ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can’t do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day. The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social mediain another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against bothAppleandAmazon, too. The Justice Department also targeted Google’s digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week inanother federal judge’s decisionthat found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year. ___ Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",Politics,1
Trump’s transportation officials buck a long-held practice of using ‘road diets’ to slow speeders,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2028,AP News,Jeff McMurray,21-04-25,"A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away. Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing thedamage caused by vehiclesspeeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways. “A wide road makes people think, ‘We’ll just drive as fast as we want on it,’” said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above. Whenconcrete sidewalk barriersdidn’t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a “road diet.” Removing laneshas been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. PresidentDonald Trump’sadministration doesn’t like it either. Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round ofroad safety grantssay projects aimed at “reducing lane capacity” should be considered “less favorably,” the administration said. Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces “can lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,” the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. “The update reflects the Department’s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.”  Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, betterpedestrian crossingsand protected on-street parking spaces. Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years,federal guidelinessaid lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city’s four-lane roads don’t meet that threshold. Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City’s road diets, calls the strategy “a smashing success” and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries. “In the architectural world you’d call it environmental determinism,” Evans said. “You want to make it so they don’t feel comfortable going too fast. You’re really not slowing them down. You’re bringing them back to the speed limit.” Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety. Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months. But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said. “Those cars have to go somewhere,” he said. “Cars are like water. They seek their own level.” Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn’t sure if the Trump administration’s new guidance will make them reconsider. “I certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,” Shahum said. “That would be a real loss.” Trump’s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns. When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass. Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through. “The road diet didn’t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,” she said. Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states. San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies. “They basically used Broadway as a political football,” said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop. Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year calling for a 180-day review period and several other steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles. Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan. Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote. “I’ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,” said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. “It creates more opportunity for conflict.” Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can’t stop all reckless drivers. “If you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you’re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,” Evans said.",Politics,1
Drones pose increasing risk to airliners near major US airports,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2029,AP News,Aaron Kessler,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A commercial airliner was on final approach to San Francisco’s international airport in November when the crew spotted a drone outside the cockpit window. By then it was too late “to take evasive action,” the pilots reported, and the quadcopter passed by their windshield, not 300 feet away. A month earlier, a jetliner was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet near Miami’s international airport when its pilots reported a “close encounter” with a drone. In August, a drone came within 50 feet of clipping the left wing of a passenger jet as it departed Newark International Airport. The incidents were all classified as “near midair collisions” — any one of which could have had catastrophic consequences, according to aviation safety experts. They were also not isolated encounters. An Associated Press analysis of anaviation safety databasereveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial passenger planes taking off and landing at the country’s top 30 busiest airports. That was the highest percentage of such near misses since 2020, when air traffic dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first reports of near misses involving drones were logged in 2014, the AP found. The number of such encounters spiked the following year. Over the last decade, drones accounted for 51% — 122 of 240 — of reported near misses, according to AP’s analysis. Passenger jets have long been subject to risks around airports — whether from bird strikes or congested airspace — as was made clear by theJanuary collisionbetween a military helicopter and commercial jet near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people. The threat from drones has become more acute in the last decade as the use of quadcopters and remote-controlled planes has exploded in popularity. TheFAA estimatesthat Americans are operating more than a million drones for recreational and commercial purposes. “If you have the money, you can go on the internet and buy a pretty sophisticated drone that can reach altitudes they really have no business being at,” said William Waldock, a professor of safety science atEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The risk is most acute near airports because that is where the flight paths of drones and airplanes most overlap, experts said. The incidents represent only a portion of such close calls because thedatabase— NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System — relies on voluntary submissions from pilots and other aviation workers. A separate FAAprogram, which includes reports from the public, tallied at least 160 sightings last month of drones flying near airports. “The FAA recognizes that urgency, and we all know additional changes need to be made to allow the airports to go out and detect and mitigate where necessary,” said Hannah Thach, executive director of thepartnership, known as Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence.

The FAA said it has taken steps to mitigate the risks of drones. It has prohibited nearly all drones from flying near airports without prior authorization, though such rules are difficult to enforce, and recreational users may not be aware of restrictions. The agency requiresregistrationsfor drones weighing more than 250 grams (0.55 pounds), and such drones are required to carry a radiotransponderthat identifies the drone’s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Additional rules govern commercial drone use. The agency has also beentesting systems to detect and counterdrones near airports. Among the methods being examined: Using radio signals to jam drones or force them to land. Authorities are also weighing whether to deploy high-powered microwaves or laser beams to disable the machines. Experts said the FAA and other authorities could do more. They suggested creating a system similar to speed cameras on roadways that could capture a drone’s transponder code and send its pilots a ticket in the mail. They also said the FAA should consider regulations that require all manufacturers to program a drone’s GPS unit to prevent it from flying near airports and other sensitive areas, a method called “geofencing.” DJI, a leading drone maker, used such geofencing restrictions for years. However, iteliminated the featurein January, replacing it with an alert to drone pilots when they approach restricted areas. Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said managing requests from authorized users to temporarily disable the geofencing became an increasingly time-consuming task. More than one million such requests were processed last year. “We had around-the-clock service, but the number of applications coming in were becoming really hard to handle,” Welsh said. “They all had to be reviewed individually.” With no other manufacturers enabling geofencing, and without government rules requiring it, DJI decided to end the practice, he said. The FAA declined to say if it is considering whether to mandate geofencing. Experts said authorities should take more aggressive action to hold drone users accountable for violating restricted airspace — to highlight the problem and deter others from breaking the rules, pointing to recent arrests that they hoped might send such a message. In December, for example, Boston policearrested two menwho operated a drone that flew dangerously close to Logan International Airport. Police reported that they were able to find the drone flyers, in part, by tracking the aircraft thanks to its FAA-mandated transponder signal. A month later, a small drone collided with a “Super Scooper” plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane’s left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs. Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man, who has yet to be sentenced,admitted he launched his DJI quadcopterto observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that’s when it struck the “Super Scooper.” ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at[email protected]orhttps://www.ap.org/tips/",Politics,1
Anti-Trump resistance sees another leader in Van Hollen as Democrats’ leadership carousel turns,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2030,AP News,Steve Peoples,20-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Now, it’s Chris Van Hollen’s turn. The mild-mannered Maryland senator has suddenly emerged as aleading figure in the resistancetoDonald Trump’s norm-busting presidency, becoming the latest in a small but growing collection ofDemocratic officialstestingthe strength of their political powerin a weakened party with no clear leader. Van Hollen’s rise follows his decisionto travel 2,000 miles to El Salvadorlast week to meet withKilmar Abrego Garcia, who waswrongly deportedand federal courts have saidshould be returned. Van Hollen did not secure the release of the Salvadoran citizen who had been living in Maryland. But simply by meeting with him, in defiance of Trump and his ally El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, Van Hollen created a new sense of hope and momentum for Abrego Garcia’s family and the anti-Trump resistance. Maryland Sen.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)  “Sen. Van Hollen’s leadership in this moment is exactly how Democrats should be pushing back against a wannabe dictator like Donald Trump — calling for law and order over chaos and adhering to the Constitution instead of a tyrant,” Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin told The Associated Press. “No matter how much Trump tries to act out his dictatorial fantasies, Democrats will always defend democracy when it’s on the line.” Van Hollen’s emergence in a critical national debate offers a fresh window into the Democratic Party’s monthslong leadership carousel as it struggles to counter a series of Trump administration policies with far-reaching consequences, from slashing the federal workforce to stripping funding from universities, pushing back againstcourt ordersand launching a trade war that’s rattling the global economy. The Democrats’ most visible elected leaders, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer, both of New York, have lost the confidence of manyprogressive activistsfor not fighting Trump withthe urgency or creativity that the moment demands. Ezra Levin, co-founder of the resistance groupIndivisible, said the growing protest movement is directed both at Trump and “the Schumers of the world, those who want us to roll over and play dead.” “Courage is impressive and contagious,” Levin said, noting that he’s hearing “a ton of positive feedback for (Van Hollen) among our folks on the ground.” He said the reaction is akin to the outpouring of support for Sen.Cory Booker, D-N.J., earlier in the month. Booker had stepped into the leadership void by delivering a record-breaking 25-hour speech on the Senate floor that briefly served asa rallying pointfor the frustrated anti-Trump movement. Concerned voters also have packed into rallies hosted by Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who have launched a national “Stop Oligarchy” tour. At the same time, potential 2028 presidential contenders such as Govs.Gavin Newsomof California andGretchen Whitmerof Michigan have gone the other way by downplaying their Trump criticism at times. Others, including Govs.Josh Shapiroof Pennsylvania andWes Mooreof Maryland, have largely avoided stepping into the national debate. “I don’t think it’s ever wrong to fight for the constitutional rights of one person, because if we give up on one person’s rights we threaten everybody’s rights,” Van Hollen said Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I think a lot of voters — both Republican and Democrat — are tired of elected officials and politicians who just put their finger to the wind. And I would say that anyone who’s not prepared to stand up and fight for the Constitution doesn’t deserve to lead.” Van Hollen’s trip was praised by many on the left, but there was no shortage of detractors — even within his own party.

(AP Photo/Salvador Melendez)  Newsom described the Democratic Party’s focus on the Abrego Garcia case as “the distraction of the day” that allows Republicans to avoid tough questions about Trump’s tariffs, which have upended global trade and threaten to worsen inflation. Indeed, Republicans have embraced the Abrego Garcia debate. White House border czar Tom Homan called Van Hollen’s move “disgusting.” Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, speaking at the White House, said Van Hollen’s “heart is reserved for an illegal alien who’s a member of a foreign terrorist organization.” “It seems to me that these Democrats are representing the illegal aliens against the very constituents, the U.S. citizens, that they’re supposed to be protecting,” said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., also on CNN. When pressed repeatedly, Emmer did not say whether he backed Trump’s suggestion that U.S. citizens convicted of serious crimes could be jailed in other countries such as El Salvador. Abrego Garcia came to the United States illegally in 2013 at 16, but an immigration judge in 2019 granted him legal protection that allowed him to stay and work in the U.S. He has a valid work permit. His wife and their three children are U.S. citizens. The administration insists that Abrego Garcia is a MS-13 gang member, although he has not been charged with any crimes. Van Hollen is no stranger to national politics, although he has perhaps spent as much time shaping the political landscape during his two decades in Congress as fighting on its front lines. Since he joined Congress in 2003, the 66-year-old attorney has done his turn as head of both the House and Senate campaign arms, a rare feat that put him at the center of his party’s national political strategy. That said, he has a lower national profile than other Democrats who have stepped into the spotlight in recent months. Van Hollen has never run for president nor hinted he may. Sanders nearly won the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, while Booker ran unsuccessfully for president that year and told the AP recently that he would not rule out another bid. Still, Van Hollen has been especially aggressive against Trump this year. He was a co-host of the first major rally against Trump andElon Musk’scuts at the U.S. Agency for International Development, a protest that brought out a dozen members of Congress. Given that so many government agencies and workers live in Maryland, the senator has been a leading advocate against Trump’s cuts, including those at NASA, the National Institutes of Health and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, among others. On Sunday, he was interviewed on five major new shows. He repeatedly pushed back against questions on allegations about Abrego Garcia’s gang affiliations. Like Democrats across the country, he tried to cast the debate as not about immigration but about Trump’s refusal to follow the law. A federal appeals court issueda blistering orderThursday raising serious constitutional concerns about the Trump administration’s behavior. The three-judge panel said the Republicanpresident’sgovernment is “asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order.” Van Hollen highlighted those concerns. “My whole point here is if you deprive one man of his constitutional rights, you threaten the constitutional rights of everybody,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I’m not vouching for the individual. I’m vouching for his rights under the Constitution.”",Politics,1
"Toll on Manhattan drivers remains in effect, despite Trump’s Easter Sunday deadline",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2031,AP News,,20-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s$9 congestion tollon most drivers entering the busiest part of Manhattan remained in effect Sunday, despite an Easter deadline from the Trump administration to halt the first-in-the-nation fee. Both Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency overseeing the tolls, confirmed Sunday that its system of traffic cameras continues to collect the fee assessed on most cars entering the borough below Central Park. “The cameras are staying on,” said Avi Small, Hochul’s spokesperson, in an email. President Donald Trump’s transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, rescinded federal approval for the program in February, calling it “a slap in the face to working class Americans and small business owners,” and initially gave New Yorkuntil March 21to comply. The MTA challenged Duffy’s decision in federal court and Duffy subsequentlypushed the deadlineback by a month, to April 20. The transportation department insisted it would not back off the deadline even as the court case plays out, saying it would “not hesitate to use every tool at our disposal” if the state failed to stop the toll. “In case there were any doubts, MTA, State and City reaffirmed in a court filing that congestion pricing is here to stay and that the arguments Secretary Duffy made trying to stop it have zero merit,” John J. McCarthy, the MTA’s chief of policy and external relations, said Sunday. Spokespersons for the U.S. Department of Transportation didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment Sunday.  The fee began Jan. 5 and is meant to not just reduce traffic jams but also raise billions of dollars in revenue for New York’s subways, commuter trains and public buses. But Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower and other properties are within the congestion zone, had vowed to kill the plan as soon as he took office. The transit authority, meanwhile, has continued to tout the benefits of the tolling program, saying fewer vehicles are now coming into the heart of Manhattan. Around 560,000 vehicles per day entered the congestion zone in March, a 13% drop from the roughly 640,000 the MTA projects would have driven through the area without the tolling scheme, according to data the agencyreleased earlier this month. The agency has previously said it’s on track to meet the$500 million in revenueinitially projected this year from congestion pricing. The toll varies depending on type of vehicle and time of day and comes on top of tolls drivers already pay to cross bridges and tunnels into Manhattan. Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes. On Thursday, a Manhattan federal judgedismissed a series of lawsuitsbrought by thelocal trucking industry and other local groupschallenging the toll. Most of those lawsuits had argued the fee was approved by federal transportation officials without proper scrutiny and that the court should order the completion of a more comprehensive environmental impact study.",Politics,1
Alito’s dissent in deportation case says court rushed to block Trump with middle-of-the night order,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2032,AP News,,20-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court acted “literally in the middle of the night” and without sufficient explanation inblocking the Trump administrationfrom deporting any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law, Justice Samuel Alito wrote in asharp dissentthat castigated theseven-member majority. Joined by fellow conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, Alito said there was “dubious factual support” for granting the request in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union. The group contended that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart such removals under theAlien Enemies Actof 1798. The majority did not provide a detailed explanation in the order early Saturday, as is typical, but the court previously said deportations could proceed only after those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals. “Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law,” Alito said in the dissent released hours after the court’s intervention against Republican President Donald Trump’s administration. The justices’ brief order directed the administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center “until further order of this court.” Alito said that “unprecedented” relief was “hastily and prematurely granted.”  He wrote that it was not clear whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction at this stage of the case, saying that not all legal avenues had been played out in lower courts and the justices had not had the chance to hear the government’s side. “The only papers before this Court were those submitted by the applicants. The Court had not ordered or received a response by the Government regarding either the applicants’ factual allegations or any of the legal issues presented by the application. And the Court did not have the benefit of a Government response filed in any of the lower courts either,” Alito said. Alito said the legal filings, “while alleging that the applicants were in imminent danger of removal, provided little concrete support for that allegation.” He noted that while the court did not hear directly from the government regarding any planned deportations under the Alien Enemies Act in this case, a government lawyer in a different matter had told a U.S. District Court in a hearing Friday evening that no such deportations were then planned to occur either Friday or Saturday. “In sum, literally in the middle of the night, the Court issued unprecedented and legally questionable relief without giving the lower courts a chance to rule, without hearing from the opposing party, within eight hours of receiving the application, with dubious factual support for its order, and without providing any explanation for its order,” Alito wrote. “I refused to join the Court’s order because we had no good reason to think that, under the circumstances, issuing an order at midnight was necessary or appropriate. Both the Executive and the Judiciary have an obligation to follow the law.” The administration has filed paperwork urging the high court to reconsider its hold. On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported. The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act. In the emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU warned that immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which would make them subject to Trump’s use of the law. It has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The administration contends it gives them the power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status. Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges inColorado,New York and southern Texaspromptly issued orders barring removal of detainees under the law until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court. But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state. Some Venezuelans subject to Trump’s use of the law have been sent to El Salvador and housed in itsnotoriousmain prison.",Politics,1
This Midwestern city has long been a federal hub. The pain from DOGE’s cuts is everywhere,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2033,AP News,Ryan J. Foley,20-04-25,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs. Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion. But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in thelatest mass firingordered by President Donald Trump’s administration. The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at theAdministration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “Not only me, but all these peoples’ lives are turned upside down,” Giagnorio said. The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees andElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiencycan be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy. With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.  An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout. A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood’s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded. The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic. A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market. And the city’s Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk’s electric car company out of Missouri. Shea Giagnorio, left, talks to a recruiter at a job fair on the day she was laid off from her job at the Administration for Children and Families, Tuesday, April 1, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The nation’s health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency’s 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families. “The poor will become even more poor now,” Giagnorio said. “If we’re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we’re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?”  Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers. But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn’t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year. For now, she can’t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when?

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful. The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later. “It’s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what’s required of them,” said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.  By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week. Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies. Ellis said IRS workers share the public’s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she’s decided to take a “roll of the dice” and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer. “I love my job,” she said. “I’m not going to let the bully force me out.” Volunteers weed garden plots in preparation for planting vegetables at the Ivanhoe neighborhood community garden, Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century. Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers’ market serving the area.  Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children. In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award “no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.” A client picks up staples at the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, Tuesday, April 15, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA’s decision. “What do you do if you don’t support providing access to food to people who don’t have it? Wouldn’t this make your job easier?” she said. “I think it’s absurd. It doesn’t make any sense.” Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising. At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City. “It just means giving families less food,” said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he’s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. “It’s as simple as that.” Laboratory technician Asfaw Ayana examines a sample at the Kansas City Department of Public Health, Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The Kansas City Health Department’s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s. One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times. Kansas City’s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.  “That early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,” she said. But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration’s $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news “crushed” the department’s carefully laid plans, Jones said. Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents. “It would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,” she said. “We had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.” Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he’s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month. Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz ofhundreds of lease cancellationsthat has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.  In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE’s online “Wall of Receipts.” Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market. But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic. “Businesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,” he said. “A lot of people are going to be unhappy but it’s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.” Demonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Department of Government Efficiency cuts outside a Tesla dealership, Saturday, April 12, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  With liberal anger growing at Musk’s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts. State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close. Organizers of a newly launched “Unplug Musk” initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world’s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.  They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis. Missouri’s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan. “There’s not a soul in this country who’s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people’s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,” said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state’s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum. An HHS spokesperson said the agency’s downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, “HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.” The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public. Musk said last year that Trump’s budget cuts would cause a “temporary hardship” that would soon put the economy on stronger footing. One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses. “It’s a big burden that’s being placed on a narrow group of people,” said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. “It will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.” Trump has credited DOGE with helping end “the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,” saving billions to help improve the nation’s finances. The White House didn’t respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic. __ Associated Press writer Heather Hollingsworth contributed to this report.",Politics,1
Marijuana holiday 4/20 coincides with Easter and Passover this year. Here’s what to know,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2034,AP News,Gene Johnson,21-04-25,"Marijuana culture’s high holiday, known as 4/20, fell this year onEaster Sunday, as well as the last day ofPassover, meaning cannabis fans celebrated in some unusual ways, including an “Easter nug hunt” in Los Angeles, kosher-style THC gummies in New York and a “blaze and praise” drag brunch in Portland, Oregon. “It seemed appropriate with egg prices today that we’d be searching for something else,” said Brett Davis, who runs the marijuana tour company Weed Bus Los Angeles and organized the “Easter nug hunt.” Drag performer Ed Du’Bull adjusts the green fabric on his cross made to look like lit joints after performing in a “blaze and praise” drag brunch at Bar Carlo on Sunday, April 20, 2025, in Portland, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane)  Here’s a look at 4/20’s history and how it’s being celebrated this year: The origins of the date, and the term “420” generally, were long murky. Music fans seek shelter in a grass hut at the Woodstock Music and Art Festival in Bethel, N.Y., Aug. 17, 1969. (AP Photo/File)  Some claimed it referred to a police code for marijuana possession or was derived from Bob Dylan’s “Rainy Day Women No. 12 & 35,” with its refrain of “Everybody must get stoned,” 420 being the product of 12 times 35. But the prevailing explanation is that it started in the 1970s with agroup of bell-bottomed buddiesfrom San Rafael High School, in California’s Marin County north of San Francisco, who called themselves “the Waldos.” A friend’s brother was afraid of getting busted for a patch of cannabis he was growing in the woods at nearby Point Reyes, so he drew a map and gave the teens permission to harvest the crop, the story goes. During fall 1971, at 4:20 p.m., just after classes and football practice, the group would meet up at the school’s statue of chemist Louis Pasteur, smoke a joint and head out to search for the weed patch. They never did find it, but their private lexicon — “420 Louie” and later just “420” — would take on a life of its own.  The Waldos saved postmarked letters and other artifacts from the 1970s referencing “420,” which they now keep in a bank vault, and when the Oxford English Dictionary added the term in 2017, it cited some of those documents asthe earliest recorded uses.

The Waldos began hanging out in the band’s circle, and the slang term spread. Fast-forward to the early 1990s: Steve Bloom, a reporter for the cannabis magazine High Times, was at a Dead show when he was handed a flyer urging people to “meet at 4:20 on 4/20 for 420-ing in Marin County at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt. Tamalpais.” High Times published it. A guest takes a puff from a marijuana cigarette at the Sensi Magazine party celebrating the 420 holiday in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, April 20, 2019. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel, File)  “It’s a phenomenon,” one of the Waldos, Steve Capper, now 69, once told The Associated Press. “Most things die within a couple years, but this just goes on and on. It’s not like someday somebody’s going to say, ‘OK, Cannabis New Year’s is on June 23rd now.’” While the Waldos came up with the term, the people who made the flier that was distributed at the Dead show — effectively turning 4/20 into a holiday — remain unknown.

Cannabis consumption wasn’t allowed onsite but there was a door-prize gift basket from a local dispensary complete with a mini glass bong and white sequined bunny ears. Bar owner Melinda Archuleta said the brunch was a dry run for hosting Pride month events in June. She herself doesn’t care much for marijuana, but as a Mexican American who has been influenced by Catholicism, she is interested in seeing the two cultures melded “in a cheeky way.” “We’ve obviously given them carte blanche to do whatever they want — it’s 21 and up — so it doesn’t matter if it’s sacrilegious or borderline offensive,” Archuleta said of the performers.

(AP Photo/Lindsey Wasson)  There are 24 states that allow recreational marijuana and 14 others allowing it for medical purposes. But the movement recently has suffered some setbacks, with voters in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota deciding not to adopt legalization measures last November. Several states also have cracked down onintoxicating products derived from hemp, which have been widely sold even in prohibition states thanks to a loophole in the federal Farm Bill. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. As a candidate, PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he would vote for Florida’s amendment and signaled support for reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a process started by the Biden administration. But his administration has not indicated cannabis policy is a priority. Afact sheetreleased by the White House last month complained that marijuana decriminalization in Washington, D.C., was an example of “failed policies” that “opened the door to disorder.” A bipartisan group of senators last week reintroduced legislation that would ensure states can adopt their own cannabis policies and remove certain financial hurdles for the industry, such as letting entities deduct business expenses on their taxes. Charles Alovisetti, a lawyer with the cannabis industry law firm Vicente LLP, said he hopes the administration will push forward with marijuana reform at the federal level, saying “it does align with some of their policy objectives — namely reducing criminal activity, or cartel activity.” He also encouraged advocates to keep pushing, noting some measures such as improving banking access for marijuana businesses might pass as part of larger legislative packages. “You continue speaking up, even if the political momentum isn’t there,” Alovisetti said. “It’s only possible if you stay in everyone’s ear.”",Politics,1

Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.” “At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with,” the post said. Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot also announced he was resigning this week. The Pentagon said, however, that Ullyot was asked to resign. The upheaval comes less than 100 days into the Trump administration where the Pentagon has found itself frequently in the epicenter of controversial moves — from firings of senior military and civilian staff to broad edicts topurge content that promoted diversity, equity or inclusion. That led to images or other online content of heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen andJackie Robinsonbeing temporarily removed from the military’s websites,causing public uproar.  Last month, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon’s intelligence and law enforcement arms were investigating what it says areleaks of national security informationfollowing reports that Elon Musk was set to receive a classified briefing on potential war plans with China. In the announcement by Hegseth’s chief of staff, Joe Kasper, the office warned that Defense Department personnel could face polygraphs in the probe. The departures also follow the firings of senior military officers, includingJoint Chiefs Chairman Gen. CQ Brown; Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti;National Security Agencyand U.S. Cyber Command director Gen. Tim Haugh; and Vice Adm.Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. military representative to the NATO Military Committee.",Politics,1
Sharon Lokedi breaks Boston Marathon course record. John Korir joins his brother as a Boston winner,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2036,AP News,Jimmy Golen,21-04-25,"BOSTON (AP) — Sharon Lokedi broke the Boston Marathon course record, and fellow Kenyan John Korir joined his brother as a race champion on Monday as the city celebrated the 250th anniversary of the start of the Revolutionary War. Lokedi outran two-time defending champion Hellen Obiri over the final mile a year after losing a sprint down Boylston Street to her in one of the closest finishes in race history. Lokedi finished in an unofficial 2 hours, 17 minutes, 22 seconds — 19 seconds ahead of Obiri and more than 2 1/2 minutes faster than the previous Boston best. Six months after winning Chicago, Korir finished in 2:04:45 — the second-fastest winning time in race history as the runners took advantage of perfect marathon weather to conquer the 26.2 miles from Hopkinton to Boston’s Copley Square. After crossing the line, Korir was greeted by his older brother, 2012 Boston winner Wesley Korir. Although the race has been won by a pair of unrelated John Kelleys and two different Robert Cheruiyots, the Korirs are the first brothers — or relatives of any kind — to win the world’s oldest and most prestigious annual marathon. Conner Mantz of Provo, Utah, finished fourth after losing a three-way sprint to the finish with Alphonce Felix Simbu of Tanzania and Cybrian Kotut of Kenya. Simbu was second and Kotut was third. Korir ran without his bib showing, pulling it out of his running tights as he sprinted down Boylston Street.  Reenactors on horseback, accompanied by a fife and drum playing “Yankee Doodle,” helped start the festivities and add a bit of levity when Paul Revere’s horse was spooked by the finish line decal on the street and stopped. The actor portraying the colonial silversmith and patriot had to hop off and walk the last few steps himself as the small early crowd laughed and clapped. After reading a proclamation, Revere gently tugged the horse the rest of the way before riding off to more ceremonies commemorating the midnight ride on April 19, 1775, that warned the colonists in Lexington and Concord that the British were on the march. Marcel Hug of Switzerland had no such trouble completing the course, zooming into Copley Square in 1:21:34 for his eighth Boston wheelchair title. He beat two-time winner Daniel Romanchuk by more than four minutes in the50th anniversary of Bob Hall’s pioneering pushto add a wheelchair division to the race. “It means a lot to win this year, 50 years of wheelchairs in Boston,” Hug said. “For me, it will take some time to realize what it means, eight times wins. It’s such an incredible number.” Susannah Scaroni of the United States won the women’s wheelchair race for the second time, finishing in 1:35:20. Her victory guaranteed that the “Star-Spangled Banner” would play on Boylston Street in Copley Square on Patriots’ Day, the state holiday that commemorates the first shots of the Revolutionary War250 years ago Saturday. ___ Associated Press writer Jennifer McDermott in Hopkinton, Mass., contributed to this story. ___ AP sports:https://apnews.com/hub/sports",Sports,1
Sports world mourns soccer-loving Pope Francis with games in Italy and Argentina postponed,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2037,AP News,Andrew Dampf,21-04-25,"ROME (AP) — Top-flight soccer matches in Italy and Argentina were postponed afterthe death of Pope Francison Monday. The Buenos Aires club that the Argentine pontiff supported throughout his life was also mourning its most famous fan. The wider soccer and sports world paid homage after Francis died at 88. All sports events scheduled for Easter Monday in Italy were postponed, includingfour Serie A games: Torino vs. Udinese, Cagliari vs. Fiorentina, Genoa vs. Lazio and Parma vs. Juventus. The games will now be played on Wednesday. Likewise, three top-flight games in Argentina were postponed from Monday to Tuesday: Tigre vs. Belgrano, Argentinos Juniors vs. Barracas Central and Independiente Rivadavia vs. Aldosivi. The games will be preceded by a minute of silence to mourn Francis, who was the Archbishop of Buenos Aires before being elected pope. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said he was “deeply saddened” over the pope’s death. “I was privileged enough to spend some time with him on a couple of occasions, and he always shared his enthusiasm for football and stressed the important role our sport plays in society,”Infantino said on Instagram. “All the prayers of the whole football world are with him.” International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said “we are losing a great friend and supporter of the Olympic movement.” Bach added that Francis’ “support for the peace and solidarity mission of the Olympic Games and the many refugee initiatives of the IOC has been unwavering.” Francis’ passion for soccer became known almost immediately after he was elected as the first pope from Latin America in 2013 when the Argentine clubSan Lorenzo tweeted a photo of him holding up the team’s crest. He was even a card-carrying member of the club, with San Lorenzo ID No. 88,235. San Lorenzo is nicknamed “the Saints.” “He was always one of us,”San Lorenzo said in tributeon Instagram, remembering how Francis watched its 1946 championship team as a boy. San Lorenzo performed well after Francis was elected as the 266th pope in March 2013. The team won a national title in 2013 and claimed the Copa Libertadores for the first time a year later. Club officials traveled twice to the Vatican carrying trophies to thank Francis for his support. A planned new San Lorenzostadium is to be named for Francis. In Italy, there were also suggestions that Francis supported Juventus since his family came from the Piedmont region where the Turin club is based. Francis’ father, Mario Bergoglio, was a basketball player. Francis met countryman Diego Maradonatwice as pope. There was a special audience in connection with a charity soccer match in 2014 when Maradona presented the pontiff with a soccer jersey, emblazoned with the name “Francisco” — Spanish for Francis — and Maradona’s No. 10. “We all now realize he’s a (star),”Maradona saidafter another meeting in 2015. “I’m Francis’ top fan.” When Maradona died in 2020, Francis remembered the soccer great in his prayers. “A different, approachable, Argentine pope,” Lionel Messi, another Argentina soccer great, said on Instagram. “Thank you for making the world a better place. We will miss you.” Record 15-time European soccer championReal Madrid also mourned Francisin a message on Instagram. During ameeting with the Argentina and Italy national teamsshortly after he was elected, Francis noted the influence of athletes, especially on youth, and told the players to remember that, “for better or worse” they were role models. “Dear players, you are very popular. People follow you, and not just on the field but also off it,” he said. “That’s a social responsibility.” Francis often hailed sports as a way to promote solidarity and inclusion, especially for young people. At a global conference on faith and sport in 2016, Francis implored leaders to do a better job of keeping corruption off the playing field and said sports must be protected from manipulations and commercial abuse. “Francis was a special pope, able to illuminate in his time like only the greatest can,” Gianluigi Buffon, the former Italy captain who met the pope many times,said on Instagram. “He showed us the way with great courage and moved our souls. I will carry his example forever in my heart.” ___ AP Sports Writer Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo contributed. ___ AP soccer:https://apnews.com/hub/soccer",Sports,1
Long journey to the NFL draft is only the beginning for college prospects aiming to make the pros,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2038,AP News,Rob Maaddi,21-04-25,"TheNFL draftis the culmination of a lifelong dream for many college players who’ve envisioned hearing their names called by Commissioner Roger Goodell since they were kids. They’ve made plenty of sacrifices and spent hundreds of hours practicing on the field, exercising in the weight room and studying film. They’ve dealt with injuries — some had to overcome significant ones— and battled adversity along the way. And the journey is just beginning, especially for the players who aren’t picked in the first round and don’t get a guaranteed multiyear contract. Prospects had to turn it up a notch in the months leading up tothis week’s draft. From training for the scouting combine to preparing for pro days, interviewing with coaches and visiting teams, the process can be overwhelming. AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on the grinding path college players take in hopes of getting picked in this week’s NFL draft. Washington State wide receiver Kyle Williams, USC center Jonah Monheim and Colorado State wideout Tory Horton, who are represented by Excel Sports Management, have spent months getting ready for the big day by training at the agency’s performance center in Irvine, California. They’ll likely have to wait until the second or third day to hear their names called inGreen Baybut the round doesn’t matter because getting the opportunity is the main goal. “This is something that I’ve been chasing since I was a kid and not too many people get this opportunity, so the fact that I’m in this position and I have this chance, I’m just taking every moment with a breath and I’m not taking anything for granted,” Williams said. “I’ve been putting in a lot of work, a lot of countless hours, sleepless nights, and you never know what’s gonna come out of this. You just put in the work and pray for the best. So just knowing that this could become a reality, it’s something that I still can’t believe and then once my name gets called, I’m just gonna have to take it all in and just really understand that this is the real thing.”  Williams, who is projected to be a second-round pick, ran a 4.4, 40-yard dash at the combine. He’s a proven deep threat who can line up at any of the wide receiver spots. A former quarterback in high school, Williams caught a career-high 70 passes for 1,198 yards and 14 touchdowns last season. He had 10 catches for 172 yards and a TD in the Holiday Bowl. For Williams and many others like him, the NFL is a way to make a better life, not just for himself but also his family. That’s a lot of pressure. Williams embraces it. “It would mean the world,” he said about getting drafted. “Just take a lot off my mom. I can help my family, my siblings. It gives them motivation to keep going and just to know that dreams do actually come true. Living in a society where a lot of people shy (away) from their dreams just to have this opportunity and get drafted is just like a dream come true.” Horton recorded 1,000 yards receiving as a junior and senior and used his COVID eligibility to stay in school and play an extra year in 2024. A knee injury forced him to miss the second half of his fifth season but he’s healthy and ready to go. Horton is projected to be picked in the third or fourth round. “The whole process itself is a bit of a grind, but all the work from the Pop Warner days to middle school to the high school days and just the adversity that you’re always facing within life and just the game of football itself, it kind of all plays out,” Horton said. “It kind of molds you and builds you to being that better person, that better version of yourself. And just having a little bit of that weight off of your shoulders from finishing school and only focusing on the sport that you love to do, I feel like that’s something that kind of helps out quite a bit for me. And I kind of just dedicated my entire time to football and just enjoying my life of studying and just dreaming and playing ball.” Monheim’s path could be even tougher. He’s projected to go anywhere from the fifth round or later with some draft analysts predicting he might have to sign with a team as an undrafted free agent. “It would mean everything,” Monheim said about getting drafted. “I can’t wait for whatever opportunity presents itself. Obviously, I’ve been training for that moment and I’ll be ready for it and it’d be an awesome moment for my family, for myself, for my coaches, everyone that’s been a part of this process along my whole life. “It’s another step on the road in my football journey. It’s taken a lot to get to this point, a lot of people pouring into me, a lot of work so you know it’s good to be here and it’s just another step in the road.” Oregon offensive lineman Josh Conerly Jr. spent 2 1/2 months training at Excel’s state-of-the-art facilities. His stock soared after a standout performance against Penn State’s Abdul Carter in the Big Ten championship and he could end up giving Goodell a hug on stage Thursday night. Conerly’s daily training routine started with running in the morning, followed by position drills, film sessions and offensive installs. After lunch, it was time in the weight room and then two or three hours of recovery. “They take care of us like no other,” Conerly said about Excel’s staff. “I’m a big tub guy, so I enjoy being in the hot tub, cold tub, sauna, red-light therapy. I like doing all those little things. It has my body feeling the best probably than it’s ever felt.” The time is now for Williams, Horton, Monheim, Conerly and hundreds of other prospects. The next step is hearing their name called at the draft and then making a name for themselves in the NFL. ___ AP NFL:https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",Sports,1
Duke freshman Cooper Flagg is headed to the NBA as the favorite to be the No. 1 overall draft pick,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2039,AP News,Aaron Beard,21-04-25,"▶Follow AP’sfull coverage of March Madness. ▶Get theAP Top 25 men’s college basketball polldelivered straight to your inbox with AP Top 25 Poll Alerts.Sign up here. Duke star Cooper Flagg is headed to the NBA as the favorite to be the No. 1 overall draft pick. The programannounced Flagg’s move in a social media post Mondayfollowing after a lone college season that saw the 18-year-old become only the fourth freshman named asThe Associated Press national player of the yearwhile leading the Blue Devils to the Final Four. Flagg had reclassified to get to Duke a year early, and his decision was expected all year, even as hegenerally declined to spell out plans about his professional futureas the season pushed into March or mentioned how much fun he had playing in college. “I mean, it’s been an incredible year with a really great group of people,” Flagg told the AP in March after winning national player of the year. The 6-foot-9, 205-pound forward from Newport, Maine, averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.4 blocks and 1.4 steals to lead the Blue Devils in each category. He’s a versatile threat who showed the ability to thrive as a scorer, playmaker and defender. “His highlights, his statistics, the ways he impacted the game on both ends of the floor, really in every category, was off the charts — as good of a freshman season that a guy has had here,” Duke coach Jon Scheyer saidin a social media video from the program about Flagg’s NBA declaration. “But to me the separator and the joy of coaching Cooper is the person he was every day, the teammate that he was — never about statistics or anything other than creating an environment and helping his team to win.”  The statistical highlight camewhen Flagg scored 42 points to set an Atlantic Coast Conference freshman recordagainst Notre Dame in January, along with having 30 points, six rebounds and seven assiststo help Duke hold off Arizonain the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16. There were plenty of impressive single plays, too, that demanded highlight-reel placement likehis transition dunk through a defender against Pittsburghin January. Flagg closed with 27 points and seven rebounds in a loss to Houston in the national semifinals. TheBlue Devils had led by 14 with about 8 1/2 minutes left but faltered late, with Houston scoring the game’s last nine points in the final 33 seconds and Flagg missing a late shot for the lead. Still, he was an elite and hypercompetitive force for one of college basketball’s top teams all season with a game far more advanced than his age, capable of making an impact from baseline to baseline and sideline to sideline. He won’t turn 19 until December, which would be roughly two months into his rookie season. Flagg is the third Duke player to announce an early exit for the NBA in the past week, joiningfreshman wing Kon Knueppelandjunior guard Tyrese Proctor. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

"Former No. 1 picks Mize and Torkelson are giving the AL Central-leading Tigers a boost, finally",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2040,AP News,Noah Trister,21-04-25,"This is a sight the Tigers probably expected a lot more often by now: Casey Mize pitching seven strong innings, and Spencer Torkelson hitting a three-run homer to lead Detroit toa 3-1 victory. There’s still time for both of them to make big contributions to the team that drafted them No. 1 overall. When the Tigers returned to the postseason last year for the first time in a decade, they did it without great production from Mize and Torkelson, who were supposed to be cornerstones of their rebuild. Torkelson hit 31 home runs in 2023 but managed only 10 (with a .219 average) last season. Mize made only two starts total in 2022 and 2023 before going 2-6 with a 4.49 ERA a year ago. Now both of them are starting to show why they were taken at the top of the draft — Mize in 2018 and Torkelson two years later. The 27-year-old Mize is 3-1 with a 2.22 ERA this season. Torkelson, who is still just 25, already has seven home runs and a .288 average that is well above his career high of .233. On Saturday, Mize got the win and Torkelson accounted for all Detroit’s scoring in a victory over Kansas City. After relying heavily on Cy Young Award winner Tarik Skubal in their run to a wild card last year, the Tigers are off to a more balanced start in 2025. Only two AL teams have scored more runs than Detroit, which leads the AL Central by a half-game over Cleveland. Only one AL team, the New York Yankees, has a better run differential than the Tigers.  The Chicago Cubs became the seventh team in the last 125 seasons to allow 10 runs in an inning and still win. Arizona scored 10 in the top of the eighth on Friday, only for Chicago to rally with six in the bottom half andwin 13-11. Remarkably, the Colorado Rockies nearly matched the Diamondbacks’ plight a day later. Colorado scored eight runs in the seventh Saturday but still lost 12-11 to Washington. Also Saturday, Miami scored six in the ninth but lost 11-10 to Philadelphia. Other big innings from this past week included a nine-run third by Tampa Bay against Boston on Monday, a seven-run first by the Los Angeles Dodgers against Colorado on Wednesday, and a seven-run third by Cincinnati against Baltimore on Sunday. The Rays, Dodgers and Reds all won. The Milwaukee Brewers broke a franchise record by stealing nine bases in their 14-1 win over the Athletics on Sunday. The Brewers stole eight bases against Toronto on Aug. 29, 1992. Which Milwaukee player, who went on to win Rookie of the Year honors that year, stole three bases in that 1992 game? Cincinnati’s Austin Wynns had six hits in the Reds’24-2 blowoutof Baltimore on Sunday, although the last two of those came against position players pitching. Wynns also drove in six runs. Wynns had seven hits and two RBIs all of last season for Cincinnati. After entering the game with a four-run lead in the ninth Saturday, struggling Yankees closer Devin Williams managed to retire only one batter before Tampa Bay tied it. Williams allowed five straight hitters to reach, culminating in Brandon Lowe’s tying two-run single. Williams managed to induce a double play to end the inning, but Tampa Bay went on to win 10-8 on Jonathan Aranda’s 10th-inning two-run homer. The Rays had a win probability of 0.6% in the ninth,according to Baseball Savant. Williams hasn’t blown a save this season — Saturday’s game wasn’t a save situation — but he’s now allowed eight earned runs in eight innings. Pat Listach had three of Milwaukee’s eight steals in that game. He went on to finish the season with 54, second in the American League to Cleveland’s Kenny Lofton. ___ AP MLB:https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",Sports,1

"Hawks fire GM Fields, promote Saleh to that role, will search for president of basketball ops",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2044,AP News,Tim Reynolds,21-04-25,"Landry Fields was fired as general manager of the Atlanta Hawks on Monday after three seasons, with the team missing the playoffs in the last two of those. The Hawks promoted Onsi Saleh to the GM role, while also announcing that they have opened a search for a president of basketball operations. Atlanta went 40-42 this season, then missed the playoffs after going 0-2 in the play-in tournament. “Every offseason we evaluate how we operate and ways we can improve our organization,” Hawks principal owner Tony Ressler said. “As we enter this pivotal offseason, we have several complex decisions ahead of us, and we are committed to providing the human and financial resources needed to ensure that we navigate these decisions with a high level of precision and foresight.” Ressler added that “adding an accomplished, senior-level leader to provide strategic direction and structure” alongside Saleh “is a top priority.” Fields led the decision-making a year ago when Atlanta had the No. 1 pick and selected Zaccharie Risacher, who is a finalist for rookie of the year this season. The Hawks have an All-Star guard in Trae Young and another budding star in Dyson Daniels, a finalist for both defensive player of the year and most improved player this season. Saleh joined the Hawks a year after three seasons with the Golden State Warriors, his time there ending with him holding the roles of vice president of basketball strategy and team counsel. He spent five years before joining the Warriors with the San Antonio Spurs and was the team’s director of strategy and process.

"Here they go again: Lightning vs. Panthers in Round 1, for Sunshine State hockey supremacy",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2045,AP News,Tim Reynolds,21-04-25,"SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) — It’s starting to feel like an annual tradition: Panthers vs. Lightning in the NHL playoffs, the battle of Florida, a matchup that has seemed to decide which team will eventually get to the Stanley Cup Final. And here they go again. Defending Stanley Cup champion Florida heads to Tampa Bay for Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round series Tuesday night, the start of the fourth postseason meeting in five years between the Sunshine State rivals. Tampa Bay won the East title in 2020, 2021 and 2022; Florida is trying to match that run of success after winning the East in 2023 and 2024. “I think you see it every game we play, whether it’s preseason in Orlando or whether it’s Game 1 of the playoffs,” Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said. “We’ve kind of known that the other one’s going to be there at the end of the year. It’s kind of always, we’re going to have to go through each other. I think there’s that respect there … but we almost love to hate each other.” Tampa Bay beat Florida 4-1 in 2021 (on its way to a second consecutive Stanley Cup title) and swept the Panthers in 2022 — giving up just three goals in that series. Florida beat Tampa Bay in six games last season, on its way to its first Cup win. “They know us and we know them,” Lightning forward Brayden Point said. “We’re looking forward to it. They’re always tight series and it’s going to be a good one.”  Since the season resumed in February after the break for the 4 Nations Face-off event, Tampa Bay goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy and Florida goalie Sergei Bobrovsky — both of them Stanley Cup winners — have looked playoff-sharp. Vasilevskiy had a 1.89 goals-against average and .927 save percentage in that span. Bobrovsky had a 1.95 GAA and .914 save percentage. And both had three shutouts. Bobrovsky backstopped Florida to the Cup last season. “I don’t remember much from what happened last year,” Bobrovsky said. “It’s a new season, it’s a new challenge, it’s a new contest and we’re excited about it. We just want to enjoy that experience and we’re going to try our best to win it.” A look at some stats in the Panthers-Lightning rivalry: — Wins this season: Florida 47, Tampa Bay 47. — Head-to-head wins this season: Florida 2, Tampa Bay 2. — Wins in last 20 meetings (including playoffs): Florida 10, Tampa Bay 10. — Goals, last 40 meetings (including playoffs): Florida 128, Tampa Bay 128. — Goals, last 145 meetings (including playoffs): Florida 454, Tampa Bay 454. — Record in last 168 head-to-head meetings (including playoffs): Florida 80 wins, Tampa Bay 80 wins, with eight ties. The state of Florida has had a team in the Stanley Cup final in each of the last five years. If the Lightning-Panthers winner gets there again this year, it’ll mark the longest stretch of one state or province making it to consecutive title rounds since Alberta — Edmonton six times, Calgary twice — had a team there in eight straight seasons from 1983 through 1990. No U.S. state has made it to the title round in six straight years since New York saw the Rangers get there in 1979 and the Islanders in each of the following five seasons. Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper has won 87 playoff games with the Lightning, the third-most of any coach with one franchise in NHL history. He won’t be catching Al Arbour anytime soon; Arbour won 119 with the New York Islanders for the most by any coach with one club. But Cooper enters this series just two wins behind Glen Sather, who won 89 with Edmonton. “There’s 32 teams. There’s only 16 left. We’re one of the 16,” Cooper said. “I think every year, we get looked at as, ‘OK, their time’s over.’ And every year, these guys come back and prove they can do it. It’s been amazing to be part of for more than a decade.” Tampa Bay’s Nikita Kucherov won the scoring title this season with 121 points, his second consecutive year finishing No. 1 on that list and his third consecutive 100-point season. That’s the good news. Here’s the bad news. No scoring champion has played for that season’s eventual Stanley Cup champion since Evgeni Malkin with Pittsburgh in 2008-09. And only four players in the last 25 years have tallied 100 or more points, then gone on to win that year’s Cup: Malkin and Sidney Crosby in 2009, Carolina’s Eric Staal in 2006 and Colorado’s Joe Sakic in 2001. ___ AP NHL playoffs:https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cupandhttps://apnews.com/hub/nhl",Sports,1

"Kenya’s John Korir follows brother’s advice to men’s Boston Marathon title, place in history",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2047,AP News,Kyle Hightower,21-04-25,"BOSTON (AP) — Six months after claiming the top spot on the podium at the Chicago Marathon, John Korir toed the start line of his third Boston Marathon feeling good about his chances for another strong performance. After finishing one place short of the top 3 at the Boston Marathon a year ago, the 28-year-old Kenyan began his training for this year’s race by first seeking the advice of a trusted past champion: his big brother. Wesley Korir, who is 14 years older than John, won the world’s oldest and most prestigious annual marathon in 2012. “He told me to expect the race to be tough and believe in myself,” John Korir said. “So, I believed in myself and I followed his advice.” It led John — and his brother — into Boston history. Korir powered over the 26.2-mile course from Hopkinton to Boston’s Copley Square in 2 hours, 4 minutes, 45 seconds — thesecond-fastest winning timein race history. Aftercrossing the line, he was hugged by Wesley, who’d been jumping up and down as soon as John came into view near the finish line on Boylston Street. Although the race has been won by a pair of unrelated John Kelleys and two different Robert Cheruiyots, the Korirs are the first brothers — or relatives of any kind — to win the marathon in Boston. Alphonce Felix Simbu of Tanzania and Cybrian Kotut of Kenya were shoulder to shoulder down the stretch and both crossed in 2:05:04. The photo review revealed Simbu was second and Kotut third.  Conner Mantz of Provo, Utah, was in hunt but faded to fourth in 2:05:08 after losing a three-way battle with Simbu and Kotut. If not for some fast reflexes, Korir’s win wouldn’t have happened. The Kenyan stumbled near the start and appeared to lose his race bib. He pulled it out of his running tights as he sprinted past the finish line. “Somebody tripped me from behind,” he said. Korir was fourth in last year’s race and ninth in 2023, his only two previous Boston attempts. He won $150,000 for Monday’s victory. Wesley Korir used some of his Boston prize money to build a hospital in Kenya. John reiterated a pledge to give some of his winnings to the Transcend Talent Academy, which provides an education for aspiring runners who are too poor to pay for one. Wesley has also worked with the school. Sisay Lemma of Ethiopia, last year’s champion, followed a fast pace to the front of the field about the six-mile mark and led until around Mile 9. But the 34-year-old Lemma couldn’t sustain it and fell back into a deep pack before pulling up around the 17-mile mark with an apparent leg issue. Rory Linkletter of Canada was in front of a pack of 10 runners at the halfway mark, then Mantz pulled in front around Mile 16. Mantz stayed there until Korir made a move about 20 miles in, around Heartbreak Hill, and opened about a 20-second lead on the group. “For me that was the plan,” Korir said. “We say at 20 miles that is where I would try to make a move. I made the move and it worked well.” His lead grew close to a minute as he passed the famed downtown Citgo sign behind Fenway Park with about a mile to go. Mantz was in contention for a spot on the podium as he sprinted down in the final mile down Boylston Street flanked by Simbu and Kotut. But he was outkicked by both of them down the stretch. “I made my hard move and they responded as if I wasn’t there making a move. So it was a little bit humbling,” Mantz said. “Missing it and getting outkicked for the last 300 meters is a little bitter. It’s still probably the best race I’ve had.” But the day belonged to Korir, who said his brother had a few final words for him during their extended post-race embrace. “Afterwards he told me he was proud,” John said. “Now we’re two brothers to win Boston.” ___ AP sports:https://apnews.com/hub/sports",Sports,1
"Switzerland’s Hug gets 8th Boston Marathon wheelchair win, American Scaroni a 2nd in milestone year",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2048,AP News,Kyle Hightower,21-04-25,"BOSTON (AP) — Marcel Hug of Switzerland blitzed to the front of the field to win his eighth Boston Marathon wheelchair title, claiming the victory Monday in the 129th edition of the race in 1 hour, 21 minutes, 34 seconds. The 39-year-old Hug crossed the finish line in downtown Boston to claim his fifth consecutive win in the race on the 50th anniversary of the first official wheelchair finisher in Boston. Daniel Romanchuk of the United States was second in 1:25:58, followed by Jetze Plat of the Netherlands in 1:30:16. Hug and Romanchuk broke from the field and stayed tight for about six miles. But Hug opened about a three-minute lead at the halfway mark and began to widen his advantage. In the women’s race, Susannah Scaroni of the United States won her second Boston title, finishing in 1:35:20. Swiss athletes took the next two spots with Cathering Debrunner second in 1:37:26 and Manuela Schar third in 1:39:18. Scaroni earned her first Boston title in 2023 but wasn’t able to defend it last year because of injury. This time she was dominant late, opening up a 40-second lead 18 miles in, breaking away from Debrunner. The races came on a clear morning with start temperatures in the low 50s. It made for a much less eventful day for Hug, who last year recovered from a crash in the latter part of the race on his way to victory. ___ AP sports:https://apnews.com/hub/sports",Sports,1
Justin Thomas makes two late birdies to restore his lead at Hilton Head,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2049,AP News,Doug Ferguson,19-04-25,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Justin Thomas made a pair of birdies on the crusty, breezy back nine at Harbour Town to salvage a 2-under 69 for a two-shot lead Friday at the RBC Heritage, his first 36-hole lead in more than four years. Thomas is winless since the 2022 PGA Championship and is weary of the topic. He also knows there’s a long way to go on a course that demands precision while allowing a low score. Si Woo Kim had one of those low scores, a blistering start that had him at 8 under through 12 holes until he settled for a 64. He was two shots behind, along with Russell Henley (68). Six players were within four shots of the lead, a group that includes defending champion Scottie Scheffler, who didn’t have much go right in his round of 70. On the scoring pins, he was out of position. He was in the fairway for the tucked pins. There wasn’t as many birdie opportunities, but he’s still right in the mix. Andrew Novak (65) and Tommy Fleetwood (66) were three behind. It was shaping up to be a wide-open weekend at a tournament where no one seems to stress too much coming a week after the Masters. Not everyone, of course. The mystery Friday were the four golf grips — the shaft snapped in half — outside the scoring trailer. Thomas was in a far better mood, especially the end of the round. One of those tough pins was on the 13th, just to the right of steep bunker framed by railroad ties. He played wedge beautifully to the wide front of the green and holed a 15-foot putt.  Far more impressive was the par-5 15th, where Thomas had 287 yards with one towering tree that always seems to get in the way. He prefers to hit a 5-wood for a little more altitude. He hammered a 3-wood onto the green to set up a two-putt birdie, and finished with three pars. The shot on No. 15 also illustrated the adjustments he’s making with a fill-in caddie, Joe Greiner, as his regular looper Matt Minister recovers from a back injury. “He’s still getting used to everything as much as I am,” Thomas said. “We were talking about the shot and trying to hit it right at the green. The tree was kind of in the way. I was like, ‘I feel like it’s a good 3-wood number.’ And he was like, ‘Yeah.’ “Then after I hit it, he goes, ‘I’m so glad you said that because I thought it was a perfect cut 3-wood, but I didn’t want to say that.’ That’s some of the funny adjustments and things we’re working with.” This doesn’t feel like a working vacation for Kim because he missed out on the Masters for the first time since 2016, his rookie year on the PGA Tour. “I got so much frustrated last week watching Masters, but somehow I got to move on. So I’m just trying to focus this week,” Kim said. He got everyone’s attention with his start. The signature moment was his 3-wood from 275 yards that rolled out to 5 feet for eagle on the par-5 fifth hole. And then he ran off four straight birdies around the turn starting on the short par-4 ninth, three of the putts inside 8 feet, and a 15-footer on the 11th. He couldn’t sustain the momentum, but gets into the final group with Thomas on the weekend. Scheffler was slowed by a mud ball on the par-5 fifth that put him out of position, and a three-putt that gave him a bogey; and hitting a tree on the eighth that led to another bogey. He finished with nine pars and a little perspective. “Just little stuff like that that can turn your day the wrong way,” he said. “I fought pretty hard today and hung in there well to be four back on the weekend.” Scheffler’s season was delayed a month by his hand injury and he’s still looking for his first win. Thomas last won at Southern Hills in the 2022 PGA Championship, though his game has turned enough in the right direction that he is No. 8 in the world ranking. “The majority of it has just been pressing and trying too hard,” he said of his drought. “I almost feel like I’m kind of past the point where fortunately you all have stopped asked me — which is nice — but I would also prefer to get that over with. “Something I feel like I did so well there for a couple of years is I just let tournaments come to me and I just trusted my ability,” he said. “That’s really been my key this week is I’m just trying to really trust my game and commit to what I’m doing.” ___ AP golf:https://apnews.com/hub/golf",Sports,1
Justin Thomas makes 11 birdies for a 61 to take the lead at Harbour Town,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2050,AP News,Doug Ferguson,18-04-25,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Justin Thomas had a round to match the immaculate weather Thursday at Harbour Town with 11 birdies that allowed him to tie the course record with a 10-under 61 to lead the RBC Heritage. The best shot he hit all day was an 8-iron that dropped near the pin and settled 5 feet away. He missed that birdie putt, one of the few chances he didn’t convert. There was little to complain about on a day of hardly any wind, a course in mint condition and warm sunshine that added to the RBC Heritage being the ideal place to decompress from the hectic week at the Masters. Defending champion Scottie Scheffler, coming off a tie for fourth at the Masters, had very little stress at Harbour Town in a round of 64 that looked easy — which is not to say it felt that way. “I will never say that golf is easy, ever. Golf is hard,” Scheffler said with a laugh. But he was out of position only once off the tee and one other time when he went long of a green and both times he saved par. Otherwise, he putted for birdie or better on the other 16 holes and converted enough chances for a start that only looked good — not great — because of Thomas with the lowest score at Harbour Town in 10 years. Bay Hill winner Russell Henley also had a 64, while Wyndham Clark was another shot back at 65. The group at 66 included former Hilton Head winner Matt Fitzpatrick and Gary Woodland, on the road back from brain surgery and building momentum from a runner-up finish in Houston.  Fifty players in the 72-man field broke par on a course that yielded an average score of 69.2 “I felt like if you compared my four rounds last week to today, today would be a much less stressful round of golf in terms of scrambling for a par,” Scheffler said. “A lot of the stuff I had to do last week I felt like I didn’t have to do today to shoot a good score. The golf course is obviously a bit different, but I was in position most of the day today. “Overall, yeah, I would say stress-free day.” Thomas is winless since capturing his second PGA Championship title in 2022, though his game has been trending enough in the right direction that he is No. 8 in the world. The Masters was a disappointment — no round lower than 70, 13 shots behind in a tie for 36th — but he put in some good work at Hilton Head for two days and made it pay off. Six of his birdie putts were inside 10 feet, and he threw in three birdies from the 35-foot range, one of them on the 17th hole that put him in range of the course record. He thought he had it with that 8-iron to a front pin on the 18th, which runs along the Calibogue Sound, only to miss the putt. He also missed a 4-foot par putt on the 10th. “I’ve been playing really well, really solid. Felt good about things,” Thomas said. “I just didn’t play well last week. Put some really good work in the couple days leading into the start today, and I felt prepared. It was just about going out and doing it, and it was nice to do so.” Among those who played later as the breeze — and nothing more than a breeze — began to pick up was Justin Rose, who lost in a playoff last week. He birdied his last two holes for a 67 to join a group that included Jordan Spieth, Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood. Masters champion Rory McIlroy decided to skip this signature event even before the Masters got started. Hilton Head was not a course he felt suited him with its tight, tree-lined angles. Thomas felt differently. “I love it. I wish we played more places like it,” Thomas said. “I think more architects should design places like this. It kind of stands of test of time, I think. Especially if we continue to get weather like this and if these fairways get firm — the greens are already getting firm — it’s going to be everything we want by the end of the week.” He got everything he could have wanted — save for that birdie putt on the 18th — at the start of the week. ___ AP golf:https://apnews.com/hub/golf",Sports,1
Justin Rose coping with the ‘torment’ of Masters close call,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2051,AP News,Doug Ferguson,16-04-25,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — The farther Justin Rose drove from Augusta National only made him realize how close he came to winning the Masters. His phone kept buzzing on the way to Hilton Head Island, one text after another, all of them with the same message that applauded his remarkable rally and offered commiseration and condolences forhis runner-up finish to Rory McIlroy. Rose started the final round seven shots out of the lead, too far back to think about winning. He made a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th for a 66. He was in a sudden-death playoff. He lost on a great shot by McIlroy, who hit gap wedge to 3 feet for birdie. It was a lot to process. “A lot of outpouring from people with a lot of positive comments coming at me, so trying to absorb that, trying to absorb the week,” Rose said Wednesday at the RBC Heritage. “But at the same time, looking at my phone and just wishing there was a different message there.” This is a path he knows well. Rose had a two-shot lead with six holes to play in the 2017 Masters when Sergio Garcia — like McIlroy, a good friend — made a most improbable rally to force a playoff andbeat Rose on the first extra hole. Rose was classy in defeat that day in 2017. He lovingly patted Garcia’s cheek, they embraced, and then Rose tapped Garcia on the heart. He knew what it meant for a talented Spaniard who had played 70 majors before winning.  He was equally gracious on Sunday, telling McIlroy when it was over he was happy to witness such a momentous occasion of the career Grand Slam. It still hurts. He searched for the right words. Rose was proud of how he played to match the low score of the final round with a 66. In one of those must-make moments in a major, he poured in a birdie on the last hole. There was a lot that went right. But there was no green jacket. “Just sort of ... don’t know what the right word is,” he said. “Tormented, probably, by the thought of what might have been.” He joined Ben Hogan as the only player to lose a playoff twice at the Masters, and it might have stung worse for Rose because both his losses were in sudden-death. He now has had at least a share of the lead after 12 rounds at the Masters, fourth on the list behind Jack Nicklaus (19), Arnold Palmer (18) and Gary Player (12), who have combined to win 13 green jackets. He has 23 wins worldwide, including a major at the U.S. Open and an Olympic gold medal in Rio de Janeiro. He also has the distinction of congratulating a Masters champion on the 18th green three times in the last 10 years — Jordan Spieth in 2015, Garcia in 2017, McIlroy on Sunday. The last time he lost the Masters in a playoff, Rose said it lingered for about a month. Sure, he made a few bogeys he’d like to have back from the final round Sunday. That’s true for anyone at any golf tournament. There’s still the sting of seeing someone else win. Rose would rather look back to what followed after that 2017 loss. He went on to win three more times that year, including his second World Golf Championships title. He won the FedEx Cup the following year and rose to No. 1 in the world for the first time. “If I look back to my best golf, 2017 August through to the end of ’18 is probably the most consistently good golf that I’ve ever played,” Rose said. “Obviously, I was a little bit more in the prime of my career around that time, or you could argue more prime.” Rose, who turned pro as a teenager in 1998, will be 45 at the end of July. “But I don’t see any reason why that can’t be the same this time around,” he said. “I’m working well. I’m working hard. I’m feeling good about my game. I’ve been saying all year that my game is good. I’ve just got to make sure that I’m playing consistently well enough to give myself those opportunities, because majors come around ... only four times a year.” Rose can’t help but think how little it would take for him to be going to the PGA Championship next month at Quail Hollow with a shot at the career Grand Slam himself —briefly tied for the Sunday lead at Royal Troon, a playoff loss at the Masters. “The last two majors I’ve been right there and been beaten by the top players in the world at the peak of their game,” he said. What keeps him going at this stage? He will have completed his 28th year as a pro in July. It’s moments like Sunday, being in the thick of it, delivering clutch moments. There was the birdie putt on the 18th at Augusta. There was that 8-foot putt on the 18th hole at the Ryder Cup in 2023 that earned a key halve. There was that walk up the 18th at Royal Troon last summer with thousands on their feet showing appreciation. “I’m close to kind of some seriously good stuff,” Rose said. ___ AP golf:https://apnews.com/hub/golf",Sports,1
Scottie Scheffler rested and ready to defend title at Hilton Head,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2052,AP News,Doug Ferguson,16-04-25,"HILTON HEAD ISLAND, S.C. (AP) — Scottie Scheffler was the star attraction of a parade just two days after the Masters. This one was all about a red plaid jacket from Harbour Town, not a green jacket from Augusta National. The tradition of the RBC Heritage is for the defending champion to lead a half-mile parade that ends near the 18th green at Harbour Town, where he hits a ceremonial tee shot into the Calibogue Soundas a cannon is simultaneously fired. “I had some ear plugs. It’s always nice when a cannon is going off,” Scheffler said. “It was definitely a unique experience. I was glad just to be able to make contact with the ball and not embarrass myself out there.” And at least he was well-rested for Tuesday’s opening ceremony. Scheffler is in a different spot in so many ways compared with a year ago, when he was coming off a victory in the Masters. He flew home to Dallas for a brief celebration, then got back on a plane to coastal South Carolina for a $20 million signature event. He won that, too. Scheffler couldn’t always hit it where he was aiming this year in the Masters. He still tied for fourth and was proud of putting up a fight. It was tiring, yes, but without the adrenaline rush of winning and all that comes with it. Instead of a big party, a flight home to Dallas and then back to Hilton Head Island, Scheffler enjoyed a peaceful three-hour drive and some relaxation that this tournament offers.  Even with a $20 million purse, this can feel like one big exhale. Masters champion Rory McIlroy is not playing, and that’s by design. He had mentioned earlier this year Harbour Town was not among his favorites — the course is more about position off the tee and small greens than blasting away — and he didn’t enter the tournament at last Friday’s deadline. It’s the kind of course on which Scheffler thrives. Even while running on fumes after his Masters victory a year ago, he still had enough left in the tank to put on a tee-to-green clinic, building a lead with a 63 on Saturday and finishing off the win Monday morning because of rain. “This golf course is much more about control and putting your ball in the right spots and staying out of the trouble,” Scheffler said. “The fairways here are much smaller than Augusta and a flatter golf course overall. A bit of a different test, but definitely still a good test.” That depends on how well he’s playing, and Scheffler feels he’s close. Everything is forward in his world, though there was a concession that he has been trying to catch up form having missed a month away from golf — the work in the gym, and practice on the course — from his decision to make ravioli on Christmas Day. He punctured his right hand with a wine glass and required minor surgery. Scheffler is still trying to put together a complete game — driving well one week when irons are suspect, good irons and pedestrian driving the next. “I was playing a bit of catch-up,” he said. “I feel like I’m improving each week. Body’s starting to feel better. Swing’s starting to feel better. I feel like I’m working towards having another good season. I haven’t had my best start this year, but I’ve had some good finishes.” He flirted with contention at Torrey Pines. He was in contention until the very end in the Houston Open. And even in the Masters, he was a birdie or two away — with some help from McIlroy — from having a chance. Scheffler recalls being in the 18th fairway, two shots behind Justin Rose and McIlroy, thinking of nothing but holing out for eagle. Rose was in the group ahead of him and made a 20-foot birdie putt, leaving Scheffler three behind. He recalls telling caddie Ted Scott, “I guess I’m going to aim at the middle of the green now.” Scott concurred, Scheffler made par and he was on his way to Harbour Town. His final act was twice helping McIlroy into the Masters green jacket — first in Butler Cabin, then during the trophy presentation on the 18th green. “It was cool to be able to see Rory get the job done,” Scheffler said. “Definitely from the outside it looked a lot more like relief than anything. Rory has accomplished everything in the game of golf, and that was really the last thing for him to accomplish. The guy has won FedEx Cup, The Players, all four majors. Maybe the only other thing would be the Olympics is what he would want to win. “It was really cool for me to be there in that moment,” he said. “He’s a good friend of mine. To be able to congratulate him and just see the joy on him and his family was really cool.” ___ AP golf:https://apnews.com/hub/golf",Sports,1

Rockets foiled by poor shooting in Game 1 loss to Warriors in playoffs,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2054,AP News,Kristie Rieken,21-04-25,"HOUSTON (AP) — While Steph Curry was hitting circus shots for the Golden State Warriors on Sunday night, Fred VanVleet and the Houston Rockets couldn’t seem to get much of anything to go in — even wide-open looks. VanVleet and Jalen Green made just 7 of 34 shots in Houston’s 95-85 loss to Golden State in Game 1 of the first-round playoff series Sunday night. VanVleet was 2 for 13 from 3-point range on a night Houston made just 6 of 29 3-pointers and was 11 for 20 on free throws. “It was an offensively poor showing,” coach Ime Udoka said. “The defense was good enough but we’re not going to overreact to that game. It was some of those guys first time and we had our chances.” The second-seeded Rockets, who returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2020, had three players in their starting lineup and two reserves making their playoff debuts Sunday. Of those young players in the postseason for the first time, the only one to play well was Alperen Sengun, who led the team with 26 points and nine rebounds. Despite the poor shooting, Houston managed to get within four points with about 2 1/2 minutes left on a 3 by VanVleet. But he missed two 3s after that and Warriors went on a run to close it out. “We can generate better looks,” VanVleet said. “I think our spacing can get better. We can make more shots, obviously, myself included — didn’t shoot the ball great tonight.”  The Rockets managed to keep it close late thanks in part to their offensive rebounding where they had a 22-6 advantage. They’re encouraged that they were able to get within striking distance late after falling behind by 23 in the third quarter. “We’ve just got to clean some things up on the offensive end and it’s definitely encouraging knowing that we were still in the game despite being down that much,” Jabari Smith said. “We stayed together and showed some growth tonight.” ___ AP NBA:https://apnews.com/hub/nba",Sports,1
Stephen Curry scores 31 points in the Warriors’ 95-85 victory over the Rockets 95-85 in Game 1,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2055,AP News,Kristie Rieken,21-04-25,"HOUSTON (AP) — Draymond Green easily boiled down the key to Golden State’s victory over the Houston Rockets in Game 1 of the first-round playoff series Sunday night. “In order for us to win basketball games it requires Steph Curry to be great,” Green said. “And he was just that.” Curry scored 31 points and the Warriors built a huge lead and held on to beat the Rockets 95-85. Curry was 12 of 19 from the field, hitting 5 of 9 3-pointers. He wowed his teammates with a couple of circus shots that caused the bench to go wild. Jimmy Butler added 25 points, seven rebounds, six assists and five steals in his playoff debut for the Warriors after joining them in a trade from Miami in February. “(Curry) just made some amazing plays and obviously carried us offensively along with Jimmy,” coach Steve Kerr said. The seventh-seeded Warriors led by 23 in the third quarter, but second-seeded Houston cut it to 69-60 entering the fourth. A basket by Amen Thompson with about 5 1/2 minutes remaining got the Rockets within four. Curry hit his fifth 3-pointer of the night a few seconds later to make it 82-75. The Rockets cut it to four again with about 2 1/2 minutes left on a 3 by Fred VanVleet. This time Moses Moody hit a 3-pointer to start a 7-0 run that made it 91-80 and sent fans streaming for the exits. Game 2 of the best-of seven series is Wednesday night in Houston. The Warriors got the win despite Houston having a 22-6 advantage on the offensive boards.  “I think we can play a lot better,” Green said. “That’s the encouraging part about it. I don’t think we played very well at all.” It was the 100th career playoff coaching victory for Kerr, who moved into a tie with Larry Brown for sixth-most playoff wins. “I’m lucky to coach the guys that I do,” Kerr said. “Players win games. It’s our job to try to help them along a little bit here and there.” The Rockets, who returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2020, got 26 points from Alperen Sengun in his first career postseason game. But VanVleet and Jalen Green struggled, making just 7 of 34 shots. “We just didn’t execute,” VanVleet said. “Maybe the physicality was an issue, but I thought we matched that for the most part.” VanVleet was 2 of 13 from 3-point range on a night Houston made just 6 of 29 3-pointers and was 11 for 20 on free throws. The Warriors got a spot in the playoffs with a 121-116 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night in the Play-In Tournament. They got yet another playoff victory over the Rockets after eliminating them four times from 2015-19. Curry said this game felt different than those victories since these Rockets are a completely different team than the ones he faced back then. “Playoff composure and experience in general allows you to kind of withstand the runs a little bit and not get flustered,” he said. “So we rely on that more than any of the history here.” ___ AP NBA:https://apnews.com/hub/nba",Sports,1

Solid Game 1,” Jerome said. Jerome had the third-most points in a Cavaliers playoff debut, behind LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. Coach Kenny Atkinson didn’t expect Jerome to have this type of debut, “I should (of expected it) because he’s kind of done it all year,” Atkinson said. Jerome also was the fourth player in franchise history to score at least 28 points coming off the bench. The game Sunday continued what has been a breakthrough season for Jerome. The 6-foot-5 guard — who helped lead the University of Virginia to an NCAA championship in 2019 — is in his sixth NBA season but played in only two games last season due to a right ankle injury. Jerome played in a career-best 70 games during the regular season and averaged 12.5 points, also a career high. Before the Cavaliers took the floor, Jerome was named one of the finalists for the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award. “Your back’s kind of against the wall. I didn’t really have a huge body of work in the NBA add you kind of have one last shot in a way to make it right,” Jerome said about his mentality going into the season. “I had all that time off to reflect and do mental work and see what was needed to improve on. Confidence and aggression was a thing for me as well, especially.”  Jerome is known as one of the more vocal bench players on the Cavaliers. But on Sunday it was his shooting that did the talking. He was 10 of 15 from the field, going 5 of 8 on 3-pointers, and had five rebounds and three assists in 28 minutes. While Jerome’s fourth-quarter shooting — he was 6 of 7 from the field and made all three of his 3-point attempts — was the talk of social media, his teammates were not surprised. “I mean, this is who he’s been,” said Donovan Mitchell, who has known Jerome since they were both 8 in New York. “It is full circle to come back from being eight years old to my first basketball teammate to now here we are. I know everybody’s gonna react like this is a shock, but he’s been doing this for us all year.” Atkinson’s favorite play made by Jerome wasn’t a basket. Instead, it was a drive and pass to Jarrett Allen for a layup with 5:47 remaining that gave the Cavaliers a 104-90 lead. “He got downhill and made that lefty pocket pass to (Allen) for the layup,” Atkinson said. “They went zone and he kind of shot them out of the zone, hitting two 3-pointers. He did it all tonight, and then defensively smart in the right position. He turned the game for us.” ___ AP NBA:https://apnews.com/hub/nba",Sports,1

Duke guard Tyrese Proctor is entering the NBA draft and skipping his senior season. The team announced Proctor’s movein a social-media post Friday night. The 6-foot-6, 183-pound junior from Australia was a three-year starter and one of Jon Scheyer’s first incoming recruits when he took over for retired Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski. Proctor, who reclassified to get to college a year early in 2022, came on in the second half of his freshman season, then was a complementary scorer averaging in double figures for the rest of his college career. He also worked as a reliable defender, a combination that could make him a possible first-round pick. Proctor averaged 12.4 points while shooting a career-best 45.2% from the field and 40.5% from 3-point range this year to help Duke win a second Atlantic Coast Conference tournament title in Scheyer’s three seasons and reach the Final Four. His March Madness run includeda two-game tear to start the NCAA Tournamentin which he made 13 of 16 3-pointers, though he had quiet games in the Sweet 16 win against Arizona and theloss to Houston in the national semifinals. In a video posted to social mediaby the program, Scheyer said it had been “an incredible ride” for Proctor and called him a “steadying force on the floor.” “It’s time for him to chase that NBA dream,” Scheyer said. Freshman wing Kon Knueppel was the first Blue Devils playerto announce an early jump to the NBA draftearlier this week. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Denzel Aberdeen and Sam Alexis have entered the transfer portal, planning to leaveFloridaafter helping the school win themen’s basketballnational championship. Aberdeen and Alexis announced their moves on Friday, joining Gators guard Kajus Kublickas in the portal. The 6-foot-5 Aberdeen appeared to be in line to start in the backcourt next season, but is looking to play elsewhere after former Princeton guardXaivian Leerecently committed to transfer to Florida. The Gators are also losing All-American Walter Clayton Jr., along with fellow standout guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. All three expect to play professionally next season. Aberdeen averaged 7.7 points last season, starting in five of 39 games. He averaged five points a game over the last three seasons. Aberdeen scored a career-high 22 points, making 5 of 7 3-pointers, against South Carolina and had 20 points in two other games late in the season. Alexis scored 4.7 points a game as a reserve in 24 games last season, one year after the 6-9 forward averaged nearly 11 points as a sophomore at Chattanooga. Michigan State, meanwhile, added a well-traveled player from the portal. Trey Fort, a 24-year-old guard, averaged 14.6 points last season at Samford. He started his career at UT Martin in 2020, then played at two junior colleges, and moved onto Mississippi State and Samford. The Spartanspreviously landed forward Kaleb Glenn, who played at Louisville two years ago and Florida Atlantic last season, from the portal to make up for some of their losses.  Hall of Fame coach Tom Izzo lostJase Richardsonto the NBA draft, three players in the portal — Tre Holloman, Xavier Booker and Gehrig Normand — along with three players out of eligibility, including Jaden Akins. Earlier in the week, Auburn guard Chad Baker-Mazara and Memphis star PJ Haggerty entered the transfer portal. Baker-Mazara, who turned 25 in January, started 34 games and was the Tigers’ second-leading scorer last season. He averaged a career-high 12.3 points during Auburn’s run to the Final Four. Baker-Mazara has one year of eligibility left because of a temporary waiver giving student-athletes who previously competed at a non-NCAA school a fourth season at an NCAA school in 2025-26. All-American and leading scorer Johni Broome, Denver Jones, Dylan Cardwell and Miles Kelly have used up their college eligibility, taking away Auburn’s entire starting five from last season’s top-seeded overall team in the NCAA tournament. Haggerty was the nation’s third-leading scorer last season, averaging 21.7 points along with 5.8 rebounds and 3.7 steals while helping Memphis play in the NCAA Tournament. He will be headed for his fourth program in four years. Haggerty appeared in six games as a freshman for TCU, then averaged 21.2 points as a redshirt freshman at Tulsa before making the move within the American Athletic Conference to Memphis. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Former Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward to take over as Florida A&M’s basketball coach,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2059,AP News,,17-04-25,"▶Follow AP’sfull coverage of March Madness. ▶Get theAP Top 25 men’s college basketball polldelivered straight to your inbox with AP Top 25 Poll Alerts.Sign up here. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Former Florida State dual-sport star and 1993 Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward is set to become the new men’s basketball coach at Florida A&M University. Ward’s hiring was supposed to become official during a board of trustees meeting Wednesday afternoon, but a nationwide Zoom outage forced the meeting to be postponed to a later date. Nonetheless, the sides have a five-year, $975,000 contract in place that is pending board approval. Under the proposed deal, Ward would earn $175,000 during the 2025-26 season and get a $10,000 raise annually. The contract runs through June 2030. Ward, 54, graduated from Florida State in 1994 and went on to have an 11-year NBA career, which included nine-plus seasons with the New York Knicks as well as stints with San Antonio and Houston. He retired in 2005 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame the following year. Ward served as an assistant coach for the Rockets (2005-07) for two seasons before embarking on a high school coaching career that started in Houston and eventually brought him back to Florida. Most recently, he served as boys’ basketball coach at Florida State University Schools in Tallahassee. Ward replaces Patrick Crarey, who left after one season to take over at Southwestern Athletic Conference rival Grambling State. FAMU went 14-17 under Crarey this past season. The program’s last winning season came in 2006-07, when the Rattlers made their third NCAA Tournament.  Ward joins a growing list of former professional stars who have taken college jobs in recent years, several of them amid the booming name, image and likeness era in which raising money is key to building a winner. Hall of Fame cornerback Deion Sanders started the trend at Jackson State in 2020 before getting hired at Colorado. Former NFL receiver DeSean Jackson is the head coach at Delaware State. Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick is at Norfolk State. And former NFL running back and 1995 Heisman winner Eddie George was recently hired at Bowling Green after four years at Tennessee State. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Former Princeton guard Xaivian Lee committed to national champion Florida on Wednesday and should immediately help the Gators fill a huge hole in their uber-talented backcourt. Leeannounced his intention to sign with Florida on Instagram, posting pictures of himself in a Gators uniform superimposed over a swamp with an alligator head, a Canadian flag and the national championship trophy. At the bottom was one word: committed. Lee picked Florida over Kansas, St. John’s and others. The 6-foot-4 Toronto native was considered one of the top guards in the transfer portal after averaging 16.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists a game this season for the Tigers. He set the single-season school record with 165 assists and became the first play program history with a triple-double. He averaged 17.1 points, 5.7 boards and 3.7 assists as a sophomore. He will have one year of eligibility remaining. He should help the Gators immediately after losing All-American Walter Clayton Jr. and fellow standout guards Alijah Martin and Will Richard. All three expect to play professionally next season. Lee will join Denzel Aberdeen, Urban Klavzar and Isaiah Brown in Florida’s backcourt. The Gators also hope to have big men Alex Condon, Rueben Chinyelu, Thomas Haugh and Micah Handlogten back for another year; Condon entered the NBA draft while keeping open the possibility of returning to school for his junior season. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

Justin Slaten got the final three outs for his third save. Boston took three of the four-game series. Former Boston outfielder Andrew Benintendi hit a solo homer for the White Sox, who have lost seven of eight. The 30-year-old Buehler stayed at a nearby hotel instead of driving in from Newton to avoid the possibility of getting in late with roads closed for the Marathon.

Four White Sox pitchers - all from Massachusetts - made their Fenway mound debuts within 24 hours,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2063,AP News,Ken Powtak,21-04-25,"BOSTON (AP) — Four young Chicago White Sox pitchers all had something in common before they even came to Boston this weekend. All four were from Massachusetts and they were teammates on a major league club together at Fenway Park for the first time. And within a 24-hour span, Sean Burke, Mike Vasil, Jared Shuster and Shane Smith each pitched off Fenway’s mound as major leaguers for the first time. “It’s awesome,’’ said Burke, a 25-year-old right-hander from Sutton who started Sunday inChicago’s 8-4 victory. “These are three guys I knew even before the White Sox, too,” he said. “To kind of all meet here to be able to do it in the same weekend is really cool.” Burke played in high school against Vasil, a reliever who pitchedin Saturday’s walk-off loss. “It’s really special,” said Vasil, a 25-year-old from Wellesley. “It’s one of those things where you don’t always get to experience that. It’s not like I’ve had a crazy journey compared to some other guy’s stories. “But it’s definitely a full-circle moment,” he said. “You grow up a fan of the team and you find your way back here on probably one of the more special weekends in the entire city.” Shuster, a 26-year-old lefty reliever from New Bedford, was called up afterFriday’s series-opening lossand got four outs on Saturday. He’s been to Fenway as a big leaguer before, but never had a chance to pitch in the ballpark.  “Perfect timing,’’ he said. “This has definitely worked out on the schedule as a trip I wanted to make. … It’s awesome, not a lot of big leaguers are from Mass., so it’s cool to have all four of us on the same team and to show the guys coming up that anything’s possible.” Smith, a 25-year-old from Danvers who started Saturday, had a chance to pitch at Fenway in just his fourth major league start. Having so many family members watch made the outing special. “That just means a lot to us,” he said. “Just to be here in Fenway and the debut was awesome and everything. Just to have my family here makes it even more special.” He got a bit choked up when summing up his thoughts. “Pretty tough to put it into words what the impact is, but its special,” he said, pausing. For Burke, it was a chance for the person that introduced him to baseball — his grandmother Pam — to see him work on Fenway’s mound. “She used to babysit me when I was little,” he said. “My parents would both work when I was 2-, 3-years old, and she would prop me up on the couch and roll baseballs back to me to throw back to her.” But what jersey was she, a lifelong Red Sox fan, wearing on Sunday? “A White Sox today,” he said, smiling. ___ AP MLB:https://apnews.com/hub/mlb",Sports,1

"Penguins GM Kyle Dubas won’t put a timeline on return to contention, but believes the worst is over",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2065,AP News,Will Graves,21-04-25,"CRANBERRY TOWNSHIP, Pa. (AP) — The standings said thePittsburgh Penguinstook a step back this season. At times, far too many, particularly early in the year, the on-ice product did, too. And while another sublime performance by theseemingly ageless Sidney Crosbycouldn’t stop the Penguins from missing the playoffs for a third straight year, general manager Kyle Dubas believes the worst is behind his club as it tries to navigate the tricky and often painful transition from one successful era to what he hopes is the next. While there remains plenty of work to be done at the NHL level over another exceedingly long summer, Dubas thinks the organization as a whole is in a better place than it March 2024, when the trade of popular wingerJake Guentzel to Carolinaserved as an emotional gut punch to both the fan base and Guentzel’s former teammates. It was a move Dubas deemed a necessary part of the process in an effort to restore a prospect pool decimated by years of trading away picks in hopes of extending a near two-decade run of excellence that included three Stanley Cups. The pace of prospect and pick acquisition has only picked up over the last 14 months. The Penguins have a whopping 30 selections over the next three NHL drafts and their minor league teams are contending. Dubas believes it’s only a matter of time before that success cascades up to Pittsburgh. “I’m more optimistic going into next year than I was organizationally (last year),” Dubas said Monday. “The results are going to be what they’re going to be, but I feel we’re closer to where we want to get back to now than last year.”  The Penguins finished 11 points out of a playoff spot, their worst since Crosby’s rookie year nearly two decades ago. Only Chicago and San Jose gave up more goals and only three teams had fewer wins in regulation. There are plenty of areas that need to be addressed by the time Pittsburgh reports for training camp in September. The goaltending tandem of Tristan Jarry and Alex Nedeljkovic ranked among the worst in the league. Jarry, a two-time All-Star, endured ademotion to the American Hockey Leaguein January and Nedeljkovic couldn’t seize the opportunity to establish himself as a bona fide No. 1. Yet given Jarry’s contract carries more than a $5 million cap hit, don’t expect teams to call Dubas to offer a lifeline. Dubas has already told both goaltenders they will be competing for a job when camp arrives, with the idea they will be pushed by Joel Blomqvist and maybe even Sergei Murashov, who turned 21 earlier this month. “If you look at every metric measuring performance, we also conceded a lot defensively in terms of what was expected to be given up, but we also allowed more than expected,” Dubas said. “So that’s a really poor combination. Both need to be rectified.” Better play in front of them would help. Pittsburgh’s defensemen struggled to make any sort of impact. Three-time Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson would mix flashes of brilliance with extended periods of play where he too frequently gambled and lost, symbolic of a unit often left whoever was in net in a tough spot. Dubas described the team’s approach to defense an “organizational” matter, one that he will sort out with longtime head coach Mike Sullivan and his staff in the coming weeks. Sullivan, the second longest-tenured coach in the NHL behind Tampa Bay’s Jon Cooper, is expected to return for what would be his 10th full season with Pittsburgh. Many coaches, no matter their resume, don’t stick around after three straight playoff misses. Yet Sullivan remains committed to trying to help the club navigate its retooling to the finish. “There’s always the point that very few coaches who are in (Sullivan’s) realm often want to see a team through this,” Dubas said. “But he’s been very open about this (as) what he wants to do so we’ll just continue to reaffirm that and as long as he’s on that side of it, we will roll with that.” Dubas declined to offer any sort of timeline on when he expects the Penguins to return to the NHL’s elite, only that he remains committed to building Pittsburgh into a long-term winner rather than try to patch the roster together in hopes of sneaking into the postseason. There are no plans to add any more 30-somethings to a roster that began the season as the NHL’s oldest. The Penguins do have more salary cap space than they’ve enjoyed in quite some times, and there’s a very real chance Dubas turns some of that draft capital into NHL players in their early-to-mid 20s who currently work elsewhere. The only real concession Dubas has made in terms of when he sees Pittsburgh becoming a legitimate Stanley Cup threat is before Crosby retires. The future Hall of Famer turns 38 in August, though he showslittle signs of slowing downand has two years left on the extension he signed last September. Crosby has admitted it’s been difficult at times to endure the franchise’s roughest patch since the early 2000s. Dubas expects Crosby to be “grumpy” until the Penguins get back to where they have been for most of Crosby’s career. “(We’re) trying to build something that can contain itself for a long time,” he said. “Getting those younger players who are going to be a part of that core around Sid (is important). Him helping them and them helping him is really what the focus is.” ___ AP NHL:https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",Sports,1
Canadian hockey fans conflicted over traveling to U.S. to see their teams in NHL playoffs,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2066,AP News,,21-04-25,"TORONTO (AP) — Jack Gurevitch is a Montreal Canadiens superfan and a proud Canadian who says he is upset by President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and threats to annex Canada. Still, he says he won’t let the political situation influence whether he travels to U.S. cities to support his team in the playoffs. Not everyone in his family agrees. “In anticipation of this call, I shared with my sister my opinion, and she went, ‘Absolutely not. Do not go. Do not go into the United States during this time. It’s not being patriotic. It’s not being a good Canadian,’” Gurevitch told the Canadian Press. “I just kind of disagree with her.” The latter half of the NHL season sawscattered booing during “The Star-Spangled Banner”at games in Canada amid Trump’s threat of tariffs and his comments about turning its northern neighbor into a 51st state. It has led to resentment and anger, even cloudingWayne Gretzky’s legacyfor some fans given his ties to Trump. Five Canadian teams — Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg and Edmonton — have made the NHL playoffs this year and the Canadiens opened the postseason Monday night against the Capitals in Washington. Gurevitch said he often travels to the U.S. to watch hockey or baseball, and while it’s still just the start of the playoffs, he says he may travel south to cheer in person if he’s able. “I’d love the experience of going into Washington and chatting with the fans there and just building that bond and feeding off it and having pleasant banter. It’s fun. That’s what it’s all about — connecting with people and enjoying the sport,” Gurevitch said.  Sunil Peetush, another Canadiens’ devotee who has already been to the U.S. this year to see games, has been having second thoughts about American travel after his family’s recent cruise that departed New Jersey last month. “We just didn’t feel right as Canadians. We felt like we were betraying our country,” Peetush said, noting that going to Washington would feel even worse since it is the center of U.S. government. “We have a cruise booked in August and it’s going to Alaska, and we haven’t really decided whether we’re going to do it or not.” British Columbia Premier David Eby, reacting to a California campaign to re-engage Canadian tourists, said last week that Canadians need to “keep the pressure up” on the U.S. by buying local and avoiding travel there. In Alberta, Edmonton Oilers fan Jasen Reboh says he’s a patriotic Canadian but doesn’t think that would stop him from going to a U.S. game if his team advances. Reboh, a season-ticket holder who went stateside to watch three of the Oilers’ Stanley Cup matchups against the Florida Panthers last year, rejects the argument that he should avoid the country in order to exert economic pressure. “There’s a lot of stuff that’s currently happening in our country that I don’t have a lot of control over, so if I was picking and choosing who deserves my money and who doesn’t, I think that’s a slippery slope,” Reboh said. ___ AP NHL:https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",Sports,1
Lightning’s Nikita Kucherov quietly among NHL’s best again as playoff showdown with Florida arrives,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2067,AP News,Erik Erlendsson,21-04-25,"TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — In a crowded field of generational talents, Tampa Bay Lightning wing Nikita Kucherov hides in plain sight. That’s often the case with Kucherov, who just won his second consecutive regular-season scoring title and third overall. Yet when discussions turn to the top players in the game today, the conversation tends to turn to Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, Sidney Crosby or Cale Makar. Kucherov’s resume as he gets set to lead the Lightning into theirfirst-round playoff matchup against Floridamakes clear he is one of the best of his generation. “No question,” Lightning coach Jon Cooper said. “They’re all unique in their own ways. They all have these genuine, generational attributes to their game. Kuch is right up there with them.” After collecting another Art Ross Trophy with 121 points and tying MacKinnon for the league lead with 84 assists, Kucherov continues to put his name alongside some of the greatest to ever play the game. He is one of only 10 players to win at least three scoring titles and one of 14 to record at least three seasons with at least 120 points. He joined Wayne Gretzky, Bobby Orr and Paul Coffey as the only players who have recorded three consecutive seasons with at least 80 assists. Those numbers jump off the page. How Kucherov reached them does not. His newer teammates now see that up close. “Definitely a way higher appreciation for him as a player,” said Lightning forward Zemgus Girgensons, who spent the first 11 years of his career with Buffalo. “You see him a couple times a year, hell of a player. But then you see him day-to-day and see the stuff he can do is just amazing.”  Jake Guentzel spent eight seasons in Pittsburgh where he played primarily on a line with Crosby. After signing an eight-year contract following a trade to Tampa Bay before the season, Guentzel set a career high with 41 goals and led the league with 17 power play goals. Guentzel figured out quickly how to play with Kucherov. “You get awed at the plays he makes, game in and game out,” he said. “The things he does, it’s pretty incredible. … These guys, they think the game at a high level. Because (they) are elite passers and high-end playmakers, you just have to be ready at all times.” Kucherov works on his craft, spending hours in the summer months on the ice. He dedicates that time to working on aspects of his game such as pulling a puck off the wall with his backhand. “I don’t think I’ve seen him miss a rim since I’ve been here,” rookie center Conor Geekie said. “It’s just little things like that (which) sometimes goes overlooked. He’s special. To be 20 years old and watch one of the greatest, in my opinion, playmakers ever, I think it’s a blessing. He’s just really good at slowing the game down, changing the pace. He’s something special.” While McDavid and MacKinnon are capable of wowing in real time with their speed and pace, the tape often has to be slowed down to realize some of the plays Kucherov pulls off. “The subtleness of some of the passes he makes, can’t really see them from the bench,” rookie forward Gage Goncalves said. “You watch him on the replay, and (the puck) went over one guy’s stick and through the other guy’s legs and landed flat perfectly on the tape. That’s the type of player he is and he works hard at it every single day.” If the Lightning are going to reach the Stanley Cup Final for the fifth time since 2015, Kucherov will be a big part of it, just like he’s done in the past. With four more postseason points, he will crack the top 20 all time in playoff scoring. “To be able to put the point totals he’s putting up year after year, and he has some of the best statistics in the playoffs of all time, that’s how you build cases for Hall of Famers,” Cooper said. “You’re not a one-hit wonder, you’re a one-decade wonder, and he’s going to be more than that.’’ —- AP NHL:https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",Sports,1
Howden scores twice and Golden Knights beat Wild 4-2 in Game 1,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2068,AP News,Mark Anderson,21-04-25,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Brett Howden had never scored double-digit goals until this season. Then he went out and scored 23. Turns out, Howden isn’t finished. He had what turned out to be the game-winning goal and later delivered an empty netter, and the Vegas Golden Knights opened their first-round Western Conference playoffs series with a 4-2 victory Sunday night over the Minnesota Wild. Golden Knights coach Bruce Cassidy said he told Howden to stick with what he did in the regular season rather than try to do too much in the playoffs. Howden had just six career postseason goals before this game. “He didn’t change his game,” Cassidy said. “He played physical. He’s part of our penalty kill. He’s always out when the goalie’s out, typically one of the six guys we use a lot because of his versatility. He can play wing. He can take draws as a center. He’s been real good for us all year and good again tonight.” Tomas Hertl had a goal and an assist for the Golden Knights. “I’ve been long excited for this moment,” Hertl said. “I always try to play my game, and I think it’s kind of playoff style. I’m glad I could help the team today. It was a team effort.” Pavel Dorofeyev scored the other Vegas goal, and Adin Hill made 18 saves. Matt Boldy scored both Wild goals, Kirill Kaprizov assisted on both and Filip Gustavsson stopped 23 shots. Game 2 is Tuesday night in Las Vegas. “I think both teams came to play hard,” Wild coach John Hynes said. “Pretty strong defensive efforts. Not a lot of special teams in the game. I thought we did a lot of good things to build on moving forward.”  Both teams traded goals in the first period. Hertl took the puck from Minnesota’s Brock Faber and hit the net from just inside the front side of the left circle. The Wild answered 2:20 later when Kaprizov delivered a cross-ice pass to Boldy, who scored off the rush. Dorofeyev scored the only goal in the second period when Hertl won the faceoff to open a power play. The puck went to Shea Theodore, who skated to the center and set up Dorofeyev for a blast from the right circle. Dorofeyev has scored goals in three consecutive games going back to the end of the regular season. Howden extended the Vegas lead to 3-1 early in the third period, but Boldy’s wrap-around goal with 8:14 left brought Minnesota to within one. Howden added an empty-netter with less than 1 second remaining, the Golden Knights’ second power-play goal. Wild 19-year-old defenseman Zeev Buium made his NHL debut by playing on the third pair with Zach Bogosian. He played 13:37 with a shot on goal. Buium was playing for Denver just 10 days earlier in the NCAA’s Frozen Four. Linesman Bryan Pancichleft the game3:37 into the second period after a collision with Howden. Backup official Frederick L’Ecuyer took Pancich’s place. ___ AP NHL playoffs:https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cupandhttps://apnews.com/hub/nhl",Sports,1

Paige Bueckers talks about her investment stake in Unrivaled league on ‘Good Morning America’,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2070,AP News,,16-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Paige Bueckers is ready to start not just her WNBA career with the Dallas Wings but her career as a businesswoman as well. The longtime UConn star, who was pickedfirst overall by the Wings on Monday night, confirmed during an appearanceon “Good Morning America”on Wednesday that she is an investor in Unrivaled, which just completed its inaugural season. Bueckers’deal with the 3-on-3 leagueis expected to be far more lucrative than her four-year WNBA rookie contract. The average Unrivaled salary was more than $220,000. Her four-year WNBA deal’s base salary would be just under $350,000. “I mean, investments in women’s sports — I feel like the return on investment has been amazing,” Bueckers said. “Even the first year (of Unrivaled), the numbers were shocking. They just blew it out of the water. And just to invest so much in women’s sports, it’s growing at an all-time high, and it’s just a great time to be in women’s sports.” Bueckers, who led UConn to the NCAA title on April 6, is just the latest high-profile investor in Unrivaled. In December, the league announced $28 million in funding from a group that included Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo, South Carolina women’s basketball coach Dawn Staley and USC star JuJu Watkins. Other investors include tennis star Coco Cauff, retired soccer star Alex Morgan and retired NBA star Carmelo Anthony. Before she steps on the floor for Unrivaled, though, Bueckers has her rookie WNBA season awaiting her.  After making the talk-show rounds, which included a stop by “The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,” Bueckers will be headed to Texas to do appearances andprepare for training camp, which begins April 27. The Wings open the season May 16 against the Minnesota Lynx, and they face Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on June 27, which could represent a summit showdown of the two players expected to be the face of the league for the foreseeable future. “Just to join a city and organization that embraces you, I’ve felt so much love already and I haven’t even set foot in Dallas yet,” Bueckers said. “Everyone has been loving me and embracing me with open arms.” ___ AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",Sports,1
WNBA draftees turn attention to making rosters as training camp opens in a few weeks,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2071,AP News,Doug Feinberg,15-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Paige Bueckers will beheading to Dallas, the latest transcendent college star to go No. 1 in the WNBA draft. Her spot is assured with the Wings. It may be tough for a lot of the other 37 players drafted Monday night to make teams when training camps open in less than two weeks. The WNBA has notoriously been one of the toughest leagues to make. Even with the addition of the expansion Golden State Valkyries this season, there’s a maximum of 156 roster spots in the league. Last year’s draft class headlined by Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese had 13 players make opening day rosters, which was down two from the previous season and four from 2022. Many teams draft international players to stash them overseas until potentially having them join the franchise at a future date. The league is growing on and off the court. Last season hadrecord viewership and attendance, which has led to huge optimism in the WNBA heading into the season which begins on May 16. While this season is in a good place, the league and players union are working on a new collective bargaining agreement that will need to be decided before the 2026 season takes place. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said she’s “optimistic about coming to a transformational CBA at some point.” She described the talks being in the early phases. Players are looking forhigher salaries, a new economic model and improved benefits. “We want to have a fair deal for all, but it has to be within the confines of a sustainable economic model that goes on for 10 years,” she said.  Salaries are going to be a huge part of the negotiations. They are expected to grow exponentially in the new CBA with the11-year media rights dealthe WNBA signed last July that will bring in at least $200 million a year. That deal goes into effect next year. Bueckers is going to make around $78,000 this year in base salary. That’s slightly more than Clark and Reese made last season under the current rookie contract scale. All three have supplemented that income with huge endorsement deals with companies such as Nike, Gatorade, Bose and State Farm. Those deals started when they were in college. Prioritization will also be a key point in negotiations between the players and the league. Three of the top 10 picks in the draft were international players — tied for the most in league history. The WNBA has had stiff penalties over the past few seasons for veteran players who don’t make training camp on time because of overseas commitments. As the game becomes more global, something will have to give. The league is adding two more expansion teams in 2026 with the addition of Toronto and Portland. The WNBA will add at least one more franchise soon after that. Yet Engelbert is concerned about diluting the talent pool too quickly. “You don’t want to degrade the quality of the game, already going to 16. We’re adding 33% additional roster spots by adding 48 spots to a league of 144,” she said before the draft Monday night. For now, the 38 players who heard their names called on Monday night will do their best to try to make a team in the upcoming weeks. ___ AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",Sports,1
"Fashion, heritage and talent: Players turn the WNBA draft into a cultural showcase",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2072,AP News,Bryanna Maxwell,15-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — TheWNBA drafthas increasingly become a platform for more than just athleticism — it is a celebration of identity, heritage, culture, and self-expression. Paige Bueckersmay have been the No. 1 pick, but it was Kiki Iriafen who arguably stole the show when it came to fashion. Even Bueckers herself said Iriafen had the best look of the night. Iriafen, drafted fourth overall by the Washington Mystics, is a forward who just wrapped up her senior season at USC, where she averaged 18 points and 8.4 rebounds per game. On the orange carpet, she made a statement — one rooted deeply in her Nigerian heritage. “I’m Nigerian so I wanted to work with a Nigerian designer,” she said. “I was really adamant. I want a slip. I want the waist snapped. I can’t really breathe. I wanted to feel good, I wanted to look good.” Future stars are using draft night as more than an opportunity to step into the spotlight for their talent on the court, but to use the moment to honor where they come from, showcase who they are beyond the jersey, and make powerful statements through fashion, family, and tradition. Iriafen wore a custom, shimmering gold dress embellished with intricate detailing, designed by Nigerian designer Nneka Alexander — who also created Chiney Ogwumike’s wedding gown. To complete the look, Iriafen wore a traditional orange-beaded Nigerian bracelet, seamlessly blending modern glam with cultural pride. The 6-foot-3 Iriafen was not alone.  Dominique Malonga, the gifted 6-6 forward from France and the second overall pick by the Seattle Storm, brought a piece of home with her. She stepped out in a sleek suit designed by none other than Louis Vuitton — one of France’s, and the world’s, most iconic fashion houses. “A huge collaboration between them,” Malonga said. “I’m like a simple, classic person.” Still, she made it clear that while her style might be understated, her game is anything but. As a forward, she knows she can do it all. At just 19, she’s already been playing high-level basketball overseas for four years. Malonga wasn’t the only Storm player showcasing her roots on the orange carpet. Seattle Storm point guard and former UConn Husky Nika Muhl also proudly embraced her Croatian heritage “I came all the way from Croatia to be here,” Muhl said. “I had to bring Croatia with me.” Muhl was wearing a black pantsuit with a black crop top underneath, complemented by a chain of keys draped across her body. The entire look was designed by Croatian brand Y/GIA and styled by a Croatian stylist. Even the players who couldn’t attend the draft found ways to let their identities shine. Te-Hina Paopao, the sharp-shooting South Carolina guard, was selected 18th overall by the Atlanta Dream. Appearing on TV from her draft party, she wore a traditional Samoan dress, along with several flower lei around her neck—symbolic necklaces in Samoan culture that honor and celebrate. “I am so blessed to be Samoan,” said Paopao. “When you think of Samoan culture you think of family and I am so ready to bring that culture to Atlanta .” And family was definitely present — about 300 people gathered behind her at her draft party in California, a powerful visual of support and pride. As they step into the professional spotlight, they carry with them not just their skills, but the pride of their families, their communities, and their cultures. The future of the WNBA isn’t just about basketball; it’s about creating a space where every player can be their true, authentic self—on the court and beyond. ___ AP WNBA:https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball",Sports,1

The 25-year-old Jurgens made the Pro Bowl for the first time last season following a switch back to center after six-time All-Pro Jason Kelce retired. Jurgens was a backup as a rookie in 2022 after being drafted out of Nebraska in the second round and made 11 starts at right guard in 2023. Philadelphia went 14-3 last season and dominated Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs in winning its second Super Bowl title.

"GM says Jets will pick up options on Gardner, Wilson, Johnson; declines comment on Rodgers’ remarks",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2074,AP News,Dennis Waszak Jr.,21-04-25,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — New York Jets general manager Darren Mougey said Monday the team will exercise the fifth-year contract options for cornerback Sauce Gardner, wide receiver Garrett Wilson and edge rusher Jermaine Johnson. Gardner, Wilson and Johnson are considered foundation-type players for the new-look Jets, who have anew GM in Mougey and coach in Aaron Glenn. The three were first-round picks in 2022 and have been bright spots during a rough stretch for a franchise that has the NFL’s longest active playoff drought at 14 seasons. Gardner is a two-time All-Pro selection, Wilson has more than 100 catches in each of his first three seasons and Johnson was a Pro Bowl pick in 2023 before tearing his right Achilles tendon in Week 2 last year. “We have time to make that decision, but I do anticipate those fifth-year options on those players,” Mougey said during the team’s predraft news conference. The deadline for NFL teams to exercise the options is May 1, and Mougey indicated the Jets are focused right now on the draft. New York has the seventh overall pick Thursday night, whenthe three-day draftbegins. Mougey declined to say whether he and the team are open to having talks about contract extensions for the trio. “I’m going to get through the draft,” Mougey said. “But in terms of contracts and extensions on any players, I’ll always keep that in-house. We’ll keep those dealings and discussions in-house.”  Former Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who wasreleased last month, revealed some of the conversations he had with the team during his appearance last week on “The Pat McAfee Show” and was critical of the way the Jets — particularly Glenn — handled the situation. Rodgers, who said he iskeeping both playing and retirement on the table, said he felt disrespected by Glenn during the brief but somewhat contentious meeting on Feb. 6 at the team’s facility. Mougey, who was at that meeting, declined to address Rodgers’ comments. “I understand the question and I addressed that at the (NFL) combine,” Mougey said of the team’s conversations with Rodgers. “Today, I just want to talk about the draft and Jets players.” He repeated that when he was asked if he has any regrets about that meeting with Rodgers.During the combine in Indianapolisin February, Mougey said he has “a lot of respect for Aaron Rodgers as a player and a person, first-ballot Hall of Famer,” but the Jets made the decision to move forward without Rodgers and “look forward to kind of moving past that and into this next process here with free agency and the draft.” TheJets signed Justin Fieldslast month as a free agent. Fields, who played in Pittsburgh last season after three years in Chicago, is set to be New York’s starting quarterback this season. “Yeah, we feel really good about Justin as our starter moving forward and believe in Justin, that we can win with Justin,” Mougey said. “He was a priority in free agency and we’re glad we got him here.” ___ AP NFL:https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",Sports,1
Running backs could get a boost in this year’s draft thanks to success of Saquon Barkley,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2075,AP News,Josh Dubow,20-04-25,"The days of running backs being the headliners at theNFL draftare long in the past with the league’s shift to more passing leading to quarterbacks, pass rushers and pass blockers dominating the top of the draft each year. The ingredients could be in place for a bit of a change this year thanks to one of the deepest classes of running backs in years following a season when game-changing backs such asSaquon Barkleyand Derrick Henry became the biggest free agent hits. “When I was a kid, running back was arguably the most important position on the field,” Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said at the scouting combine. “I grew up a Cowboys fan — Tony Dorsett, Emmitt Smith, guys like that were my idols. Then we went through this period over the last five, 10 years, where the analytics certainly de-emphasized the position. I think last year, you saw the impact that some of these guys had. ... I think (running backs) are looked at as probably replaceable by some people, but if you have a great one, you’ve got a historic one, you just can’t replace those guys.” The big question headed into the draft Thursday is whether teams view prospects such as Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty and North Carolina’s Omarion Hampton as those types of backs worthy of being taken with a premium pick. Jeanty was projected in the finalAP mock draftto go sixth to Las Vegas, which would be the highest pick for a running back since Barkley was taken second overall in 2018 by the New York Giants.  “We just saw Saquon Barkley just change the Eagles in one year,” Raiders GM John Spytek said. “Now they had a great team around him and it was adding an elite player. I think when you sit where we sit, I mean the idea is to add elite players at any position. I don’t try to devalue any certain position. ... There’s certain ways to build a team, and I don’t know where we got to a place where we don’t feel like running backs are valued. I come from the University of Michigan to my core, and those guys were certainly really valued there. So, it’s hard for me to get away from that.” Only one running back in the past six drafts was taken in the top 10 with Bijan Robinson going eighth to Atlanta in 2023. Five running backs were top-10 picks from 2015-18 with two being taken that high in 2017 when Leonard Fournette went fourth and Christian McCaffrey went eighth. It’s a far cry from earlier eras when running backs were often the top overall pick, including four times in five seasons from 1977-81. No running back has gone first overall since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995. Teams have been waiting later and later to take running backs with Jonathan Brooks the first to go last year at No. 46 to Carolina. There has been just an average of two running backs taken in the top 50 in the past six drafts, down from a peak of 12 in 1990. This year’s class of running backs is one of the deepest in recent memory with several players after Jeanty and Hampton projected to be picked either late in the first round or on day two of the draft including Ohio State’s duo of TreVeyon Henderson and Quinshon Judkins; Iowa’s Kaleb Johnson; Arizona State’s Cam Skattebo, Tennessee’s Dylan Sampson; Virginia Tech’s Bhayshul Tuten; and Central Florida’s RJ Harvey. The shift from a running to a passing league began with rule changes in 1978 that made passing easier and has continued for more than four decades. The rate of running dropped from a post-merger high of nearly 58% in 1977 to a low of just more than 40% in 2014 before undergoing a slight increase in recent years to 43.4% last season. But the bell-cow back had mostly disappeared as teams went to a backfield by committee. The league featured 13 players in 2003 who had at least 300 carries in a season — matching the nine-year combined total from 2015-23. Six players hit the 300-carry mark last season led by Barkley and Henry for the most in a season since 2010. “For a while, the market maybe was suppressed. People were not looking at them as weapons,” Bills GM Brandon Beane said. “I kind of look for them as anyone you add to your offense, what do they bring? What is their skill set? Is it a mismatched player? ... Someone asked, I think a year or two ago, what is your philosophy? Would you draft a running back in the first round? I probably wouldn’t draft a running back that is 3 yards and a cloud of dust, but if it’s a weapon like some of these guys were talking about, heck yeah I would.” With the diminished role of the featured back, the pay at the position has also suffered with Josh Jacobs’ running back-leading $48 million deal with Green Bay ranking tied for 159th among all players. The $13.6 million franchise tag number for running backs — determined by the highest-paid players at each position — is the lowest of any position outside of specialists. The rookie wage scale put in place in the 2011 collective bargaining agreement determines salaries for the first four seasons solely on draft position, leading teams to use premium picks on high-value positions such as quarterback, tackle, pass rushers and receivers in order to save money compared to veteran contracts. That’s a big factor that is hard for some teams to overcome. “It’s an interesting conversation, because the draft pick is about potential ceiling, ability to play at a certain level, while you have those years under contract below free agency market level, your ability to sustain a second contract,” Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said. “There’s all these questions that come into that answer before you pull the card.” ___ AP NFL:https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",Sports,1
"The Oscars mandate voters watch all nominated movies, set new rules for AI and refugee filmmakers",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2076,AP News,Jake Coyle,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) —Oscarvoters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in. But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn’t get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees. On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category. In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility. The regulation now reads: “The submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.”  Critics have long called on changesto the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That’s left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars. Last year, for instance, theIranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasouloffled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film “The Seed of the Sacred Fig.” Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof’s friend and countrymanJafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission. The rule change notably won’t alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven’t fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation’s selection committees. The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools “neither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.” How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year’s Oscar race,Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist”was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimatelywon best actor) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress). “The academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,” the academy said Monday. The film academy also set down some rules for itsnew achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a “bake-off” presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees. Earlier in April, the academy announceda new category for stunt design, but that award won’t begin until the 2028 Oscars. Next year’s Academy Awards will be held March 15, 2026, withConan O’Brien returning to hostthe ABC telecast.",Entertainment,1
‘Andor’ returns to Disney+ and takes ‘Star Wars’ to new and rebellious places,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2077,AP News,Andrew Dalton,21-04-25,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) — “Andor” returns for its second season on Disney+ with a three-episode premiere Tuesday and the weight of the“Star Wars”galaxy seemingly on its shoulders. But creator Tony Gilroy says he and his collaborators felt little pressure from Disney and Lucasfilm as they sought to tell the story of a growing revolutionary resentment against the Galactic Empire and the birth of the Rebel Alliance leading up to the events of the 2016 film he scripted,“Rogue One.” “We took no creative notes on this show,” Gilroy, whose deep screenwriting resume also includes four films in the “Bourne” franchise and 2007 Oscar nominee “Michael Clayton,” which he also directed. He told The Associated Press that “I’ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.” The forthcoming season, whose production was delayed byHollywood’s 2023 strikes, are coming with high expectations from fans who have been disappointed in other recent “Star Wars” TV offerings, with no new movies released in the franchise in six years. The new episodes trace how the spark lit in Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor in the 2022 first season spreads through the galaxy. And they do it with characters and arcs rarely found in this realm before. “This second season, it’s about all the layers, and the social and political climate that needs to happen for a revolution to erupt, for a rebellion to exist,” Luna told the AP. “The universe of ‘Star Wars’ never stopped to tell the story of these regular people that becomes crucial for the history that we know.”  Gilroy drew inspiration from a broad range of historical and fictional sources. “Who’s ever going to get another chance to do another 1,500 pages on revolution again, with this much money and this much muscle, and everything else?” he said. But as epic as the story is, its most essential moments are marked by intimate, one-on-one conversations. “I start small,” Gilroy said. “I work teaspoon by teaspoon.” That includes a season-opening scene that starts with Cassian giving a young imperial mechanic the courage to help him in a major heist. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring. “It’s quite beautiful and idealistic also, like a revolution has to be, It’s a great reminder of how romantic the idea of revolution is,” Luna said. Cast members say it can feel revolutionary working for Gilroy, who passes on the same freedom to them that Disney gives to him. They’re never kept in the dark with the sort of script-rationing and secret-keeping that are the norm in major franchises. “He doesn’t believe in withholding information as power,” saidAdria Arjona, who plays Andor’s partner Bix Caleen. “Before I read episode one, I knew the end. It’s just unheard-of.” Her character’s arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything “Star Wars” has shown before. Gilroy said he didn’t have to fight over the galaxy’s canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise — no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it’s not necessarily held as sacred. “I’ve seen canon stretch so much,” he said. “It was really tight on ‘Rogue.’ But a lot of things have changed since then.” The overall direction of the show was basically determined when work began on the series five years ago. “I know what I’m doing with Cassian,” Gilroy said. “I know that the first year is the making of a revolutionary and the road to Damascus, that’s the first year, I know I’m leading to Rogue, I know where he’s gonna end up.” Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O’Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances. Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals — and dances — new to “Star Wars” that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had. “All I did for five years was just max out my imagination,” Gilroy said. Mothma is among the “Rogue One” characters who appeared in the first season and return for the second, along with Forest Whittaker’s radical rebel Saw Gerrera, who this season gives a spine-tingling call to arms that is teased in the trailer: “Revolution,” he preaches to an underling, “is not for the sane!” Season 2 also sees the emergence of “Rogue One” characters for the first time in the TV series, including Andor’s droid sidekick K-250, played by Alan Tudyk, and Death Star builder Orson Krennic, played by Ben Mendelsohn. Luna took special pleasure in the return of Tudyk and his robot who speaks with no filter. “I had so much fun playing with him, and having him back means a lot,” he said. The three episodes dropping Tuesday gel to form what’s basically a 2 1/2 hour movie, with Cassian stuck among rival rebel factions, Bix living in a farming community amid an imperial crackdown, and Mon Mothma having to play the patrician matriarch at her daughter’s wedding, before all three are pulled in new directions. The entire series has been planned in those kinds of clusters. “We really think of it that we made eight movies in five years,” Gilroy said.",Entertainment,1
‘Sinners’ surges past ‘Minecraft’ to lead box office,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2078,AP News,Jake Coyle,20-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Brand names, not filmmakers or stars, are said to rule the box office these days. ButRyan Coogler’s “Sinners,”led by twin Michael B. Jordans, proved a bloody exception to modern movie rules, launching with $45.6 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. “Sinners,” a Warner Bros. release that cost about $90 million to produce, was a bold gamble on originality — albeit with genre elements — and one of the most bankable American directors in Coogler. The “Creed” and “Black Panther” director wrote and produced “Sinners,” a 1932-set vampire movie about bootlegging brothers (both played by Jordan) who open a juke joint in their Mississippi hometown. “A Minecraft Movie,”the year’s biggest Hollywood hit, followed close behind in second, collecting $41.3 million in its third week of release. That gave Warner Bros., after a handful of disappointments, an enviable one-two punch at the box office with one original, director-driven movie and one IP-based property. “A Minecraft Movie,” which Warner Bros. co-produced with Legendary Pictures, has amassed $720.8 million worldwide in three weeks of release. Pam Abdy and Mike De Luca, co-chairs of Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, celebrated the two films’ resonance with moviegoers. The studio accounted for a remarkable 64% of the domestic box office for the Easter weekend.  “Movies have the power to transport us to worlds only seen on the big screen, and Warner Bros. Pictures remains committed to bringing singular in-theater experiences to audiences looking for bold movies, both original and those based on beloved existing properties,” Abdy and De Luca said in a statement Sunday. But all eyes were on the performance on “Sinners,” which Warner Bros. went to extreme lengths to secure. Abdy and De Luca agreed to give Coogler not just a cut of gross ticket sales but ownership of the film after 25 years — a virtually unheard of concession. But Coogler and Jordan, whose collaborations stretch back to“Fruitvale Station,”make up one of the industry’s most potent director-actor duos.Reviews(98% “fresh” on Rotten Tomatoes) were stellar for “Sinners” and audiences, too, were enthralled by its supernatural twists. The film earned an “A” CinemaScore from moviegoers. Overseas, “Sinners” faced a more uphill battle. It collected $15.4 million in 71 international markets. Domestically, “Sinners” attracted a diverse audience: 38% Black, 35% white, 18% Hispanic and 5% Asian. Before “Sinners,” dual roles had been rough business for Warner Bros. The studio saw flops in both“The Alto Knights”(a period gangster film featuring a doubled Robert De Niro) and“Mickey 17”(a sci-fi movie with two Robert Pattinsons). But the strong opening for “Sinners,” which should be sustained in the coming weeks given the strong word of mouth, cements Coogler’s place as one of a handful of filmmakers whose name draws big audiences. Another would beJordan Peele, whose “Nope” (2022) debuted similarly with $44.3 million. Angel Studios’ “The King of Kings,” an animated tale of Jesus’ life aimed at Christian audiences, capitalized on the Easter weekend, grossing $17.2 million in its second week of release. That was nearly equal to its opening weekend ($19.1 million), and brought “The King of Kings” to a domestic total of $45.3 million. Bleecker Street’s “The Wedding Banquet,”Andrew Ahn’s reimagining of Ang Lee’s 1993 queer comedy of errors,opened on 1,142 North American screens with $922,906 in ticket sales. “The Wedding Banquet,” a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, stars Lily Gladstone, Bowen Yang, Kelly Marie Tran and newcomer Han Gi-chan. With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. “Sinners,” $45.6 million. 2. “A Minecraft Movie,” $41.3 million. 3. “The King of Kings,” $17.3 million. 4. “The Amateur,” $7.2 million. 5. “Warfare,” $4.9 million. 6. “Drop,” $3.4 million. 7. “Colorful Stage: The Movie,” $2.8 million. 8. “Pride & Prejudice” (2005), $2.7 million. 9. “The Chosen: Last Supper,” $1.8 million. 10. “Snow White,” $1.2 million.",Entertainment,1

On Friday, he’ll release his 77th solo studio album, “Oh What A Beautiful World,” celebrating the work of songwriter Rodney Crowell. Nelson embodies many Crowell classics – like 1976’s “Banks Of The Old Bandera,” recorded by Jerry Jeff Walker and 1981’s “Shame On The Moon” for Bob Seger. Crowell and Nelson join forces on the song’s title cut.

Music Review: Willie Nelson is ageless singing Rodney Crowell songs on ‘Oh What A Beautiful World’,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2080,AP News,Steven Wine,21-04-25,"It’s fun to hearWillie Nelsonsing such words as “ninja,” “fishmonger” and “absinthe,” which are among the many pleasures found in the songbook of influential countrysongwriter Rodney Crowell. “Oh What A Beautiful World” is Nelson’s latest album devoted to the songs of a specific songwriter, and in Crowell, he’s interpreting a kindred spirit. While Crowell has a slightly different lyric vocabulary, both are Texans with a deep love of Hank Williams. The pairing – great songs and a great singer – works beautifully. The album will be out Friday, just beforeNelson’s 92nd birthdayon April 29. He has long sounded ageless, but more than ever, Nelson sings like a sage. His reedy tenor can be a little whispery, but he displays surprising vocal range. His relaxed, conversational delivery is filled with warmth and wisdom. He’ll start a phrase late, end it early and make it seem perfect. When he reminisces about childhood on “Banks of the Old Bandera” — originally recorded by Jerry Jeff Walker — Nelson sounds just like he did in 1976, the year the song was written. Other material ranges from “Shame on the Moon,” a 1982 pop hit for Bob Seger, to Crowell’s overlooked gem “She’s Back in Town.” Also included are tunes that have been recorded byTim McGraw(“Open Season On My Heart”) andKeith Urban(“Making Memories of Us”) and a folksy ballad co-written withGuy Clark(“Stuff That Works”).  Longtime Nelson collaborator Buddy Cannon produced the record, and the backing musicians provide graceful, tasteful support. Nelson’s beloved guitar Trigger plays a significant role, including on a careening, don’t-try-this-at-home solo on the title cut, a duet with Crowell. Also among the highlights is “The Fly Boy & The Kid,” a prayerlike shuffle with playful lyrics that Nelson leans into. He’s equally frisky doing roadhouse blues on “She’s Back in Town,” while elsewhere the mood tends toward contemplative. “The days go by like flying bricks,” Nelson sings on the handsome ballad “Open Season On My Heart.” More than any other song in the set, “Still Learning How to Fly” seems as if it was written for Nelson. Nearing the end of the album – Nelson’s 154th, according toTexas Monthly’sherculean ranking of his prolific discography — he sings: “I’ve got a past that I won’t soon forget / And you ain’t seen nothing yet.” He sounds as if he means it.",Entertainment,1
"Movie Review: Michael B. Jordan has double duty in Ryan Coogler’s pulsating, vein-bursting ‘Sinners’",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2081,AP News,Jocelyn Noveck,16-04-25,"It’s gotta be something in the water. How else to explain the plethora of A-list twinson Hollywood screenslately? In the last few months alone, we’ve hadRobert Pattinson,Theo Jamesandthe great Robert De Niroplaying opposite each other on screen. But now we have by far the most creatively ambitious, culturally layered, artistically bold twin-led cinematic outing yet — if this sentence feels like a lot, get ready for the movie! — with Michael B. Jordan on double duty in“Sinners.” And while the Jordan-Jordan pairing is front and center and full of charisma, Jordan himself would probably agree the most important pairing here is the onebetween him and Ryan Coogler.The supremely talented writer-director turns once again to Jordan — star of all four of his previous films — for his first completely original movie. Both men are firing on all cylinders. So what exactly is “Sinners,”shot on large-format film(including IMAX 65 mm and Ultra Panavision 70) befitting the size of its vision, about? Depends which layer you’re looking at. The outer layer is a story of two brothers coming home to Mississippi in 1932 to launch a juke joint after spending time on the German front in World War I and then learning from Al Capone in gangland Chicago. Peel away, and it’s a story about music, especially the transporting power of the blues. It’s also about love: love that’s lost, love that’s found, love that’s impossible. And it’s about the tenuousness of life in the Jim Crow South. And then ... it turns into a full-on, gore-spewing, guts-spilling vampire film, one of the scarier ones you’ll see in a very long time.  It’s soon clear the only thing small about this film is the timeline — one day, unless you want to count the afterlife, which is fair. How Coogler pulls everything off at once — and makes it cohere, mostly — is a sight to see. And even more, to feel. With a crowd you don’t know, as Coogler intends it. At my screening there was frequent laughter, both joyous and nervous, some screams and not a few jumps, including one where I felt my own self leaving my seat, pens and notepad tumbling. Coogler grew up loving the jumpy moments in movies like “Jurassic Park,” and wanted to recreate the feeling. We begin our 24 hours in Clarksdale, Mississippi, with skinny Preacher Boy, aka Sammie (exciting 19-year-old newcomer Miles Caton), bloody and barely alive, staggering into a church. His father, the pastor, urges him to drop the twisted vestige of a guitar he carries. We see lightning-quick flashbacks to scenes of horror — way too quick to settle in our brains. Coogler will take his time. You got somewhere you need to be? Miles Caton in “Sinners.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)  We then rewind, to one day earlier. Twin brothers Smoke and Stack — Jordan and Jordan, who frequently share the screen, seamlessly — have arrived with a truckful of Irish beer from Chicago. Handing wads of cash to a white owner for an old mill and its land, the brothers tell the man they’ll “kill any of your Klan buddies” if they come around. “The Klan don’t exist no more,” the oily character replies. The plan is to open that same night. The brothers separate to rally staff, supplies and food. They also need music. Young cousin Sammie turns out to have a soulful voice and prodigious talent on the blues guitar. They pick up a harmonica and piano player (the wonderful Delroy Lindo) by promising all the Irish beer he wants. We also meet the love interests. Stack is the slicker of the two brothers, much quicker to smile, if not happier, with a red brimmed hat and a few gold-rimmed teeth. He’s soon approached by his ex, Mary (Hailee Steinfeld, poignant), the young white woman he loved and left. She’s angry. It won’t be ’til later that we learn he was only trying to keep her safe. As for Smoke, more somber in a blue cap, he reunites with a soulful medicine woman, with whom he’s shared past grief. He convinces Annie — played by Wunmi Mosaku with a serene grace — to come cook at the joint. The place opens. The beer’s flowing and the dance floor hopping. Sammie and Pearline (Jayme Lawson), a married woman who’s caught his fancy, hook up. It’s the best night of his young life. And then come the vampires. Remmick (Jack O’Connell), a spindly and scruffy villain, first shows up at a farm couple’s home, their Klan hood visible in the back. A red-eyed group now numbering three, the vampires head to the juke joint for the bloody final act. A scene from “Sinners.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)  It’s a doozy, and the less said the better. Well — we WILL say that perhaps only Coogler would think of a lusty group of vampires singing old Irish folk songs. In any case, the climactic confrontation is what we’re waiting for, and pays off. But please don’t leave once the credits start rolling; Coogler has more gifts up his sleeve. His very long, ever-growing sleeve. “Sinners,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association “for strong bloody violence, sexual content and language.” Running time: 137 minutes.

Movie Review: Bowen Yang leads a heartfelt dramedy about found families in ‘The Wedding Banquet’,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2082,AP News,Lindsey Bahr,15-04-25,"Two gay couples decide to embark on one fake straight marriage to get what they need in Andrew Ahn’s modern update of “The Wedding Banquet.” Min (Han Gi-Chan), a young artist from an extremely wealthy Korean family, wants to stay in the U.S. longer to be with his boyfriend Chris (Bowen Yang) and delay his family obligations. Angela (Kelly Marie Tran) and Lee (Lily Gladstone) need money for another IVF attempt after their second round failed. In 1993, whenAng Leereleased “The Wedding Banquet,”same sex marriagewas not legal in the U.S. In a modern-day remake set in and around Seattle, they would need another obstacle preventing Min from marrying his way into a green card. Here, Chris is the holdup. He refuses Min, not wanting to be the thing that gets in the way of his inheritance, but also perhaps because he carries some deep feelings of inadequacy. So, Min proposes that he marry Angela instead as a short-term fix. He’ll give them money for IVF, and he can hang around and try to work things out with Chris. These couples also happen to share a backyard — Lee owns a home and rents the one room ADU to Chris and Min. There is a version of this setup that would lend itself to some wacky hijinks as they clumsily embark on this poorly thought-out plan. If you’ve seen the trailer, you’ve probably seen one of the main ones: A panicked “de-gay” the house montage when they discover that Min’s grandmother Ja-Young (Oscar-winnerYoun Yuh-jungof “Minari”), is 45 minutes away from an unannounced visit. Perhaps it’s to Ahn and co-writerJames Schamus’scredit that these are kept to a minimum. Part of this is due to the fact that Ja-Young is no fool — she knows her grandson and has everyone in full confessional mode in under 15 minutes. This was a wise choice.  And yet, I still wanted it to be more fun, or, rather, I wanted the characters to be having more fun together. There’s a throughline about found families, but I’m not totally convinced that these people are great for each other. Chris and Angela, who we’re told have been unhealthily co-dependent since college, seem to be the dead weight in both relationships as a result of their own traumas and general youthful messiness. Angela even has the gall to propose to Lee that they should use Min’s money to travel the world instead. This is done in a drunken haze that will result in more bad decisions, but it seems like a rather important conversation to revisit, especially for Lee who has been open about her desire to have a child and who is worried that she doesn’t have much time left to do so. There is so much crying, so much anguish, so many issues left unexamined that it’s hard not to find yourself rooting for everyone (especially Lee and Min) to just cut their losses and find new people. It can be a little tiresome at times watching them agonize over problems that seem surmountable. The biggest relief comes in the form of the older characters including Ja-Young andJoan Chenas May, Angela’s mother. May is introduced accepting an award from a local LGBTQ+ group for her advocacy work, while Angela seethes in the audience. Her mother, who we later find out didn’t speak to her for a time after she came out, has devoted her life to advocacy on behalf of her gay daughter now, which Angela suspects is done for the spotlight, not the cause. But Chen, and the script, imbue the scenario with unexpected nuance and wisdom. Likewise, Ja-Young doesn’t fall into any expected cliché trappings of an older Korean woman reconciling with her gay grandson. She’s thoughtful and personal about it, wondering if she made the right decisions about Min’s upbringing years ago. May, too, is trying to atone for her past mistakes, however clunkily. Both women just seem to want the kids to be happy — and their scenes together, though brief, are some of the best in the film. Yang might be a little out of his depths in some of the more emotional scenes – especially difficult since Tran is a world-class crier. Gladstone also seems woefully underutilized, but perhaps that’s just part of her particular magic even in a solid supporting role. But you can also excuse a lot in a film that was clearly made with its heart in the right place and a deep love for all its characters, even in their messiest, most unsympathetic moments. “The Wedding Banquet,” a Bleecker Street release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “language, some sexual material and nudity.” Running time: 103 minutes.

Movie Review: ‘Drop’ doesn’t phone it in,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2083,AP News,Jake Coyle,10-04-25,"It’s oddly comforting that a movie can still dial M when it wants to. Smart phones have largely been a bit of a buzzkill for horror films, leading filmmakers to find all kinds of reasons — dead batteries, no service — to strand potential prey. But at least since 1949’s “Sorry, Wrong Number,” phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. “Drop,” a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of “When a Stranger Calls” and “Phone Booth” by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages. Violet (Meghann Fahy), a widow with a young child, is on her first date in years. After three months of texting, she has hesitantly agreed to finally meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar) for dinner. When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he’s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can’t stay off her phone. In Violet’s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who’s at home with Violet’s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun. “Drop,” directed by Christopher Landon (“Happy Death Day”), doesn’t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it’s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, “Drop” knows when to hang up.  As if adding a digital twist to the old line “The call is coming from inside the house,” Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant — the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender — is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son. A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (“The White Lotus”) and Sklenar (“1923”), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler’s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we’re asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled “Butt Dial”? But if “Drop” is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn’t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she’s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence? You could also read “Drop” as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone — a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score — whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of “Drop” would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent? “Drop,” a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references.

"Movie Review: ‘Warfare,’ a forensic portrait of combat, hunts war-movie clichés",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2084,AP News,Jake Coyle,8-04-25,"Ray Mendoza andAlex Garland’s “Warfare” is more defined by what it isn’t than what it is. In theirIraq War-set film, there’s never any description of a wider strategy. There are no backstories to the American Navy SEALs whom we follow on an unspectacular mission. There’s not a short monologue about mom’s cooking back home, let alone a speculative word about life after the war. There’s not even a dramatic close-up to be had. “Warfare” aspires to be, simply, just that. We are effectively embedded in a platoon on what seems to be a minor mission in Iraq in 2006. Walking in two single-file lines down a Ramadi street at night, one soldier says, “I like this house.” Under the cover of darkness, they rush inside the apartment building to set up their position while keeping the family inside quiet. In the morning, their sniper, laid out on a raised bed, sweats while looking out on an increasingly anxious scene. His rifle’s crosshairs drift through the street scenes outside, as suspected jihadists mobilize around them. War-movie cliches have been rigorously rooted out of “Warfare,” a terse and chillingly brutal immersion in a moment of the Iraq War. Clouds of IED smoke and cries of agony fill Garland and Mendoza’s film, with little but the faces of the SEALs to ground a nearly real-time, based-on-a-true-story dramatization. Few words are spoken outside the intense patter of official Navy jargon. When the mission comes to its bloody and hectic conclusion, the only utterance left hanging in the clouded air is the unanswered, blood-curdling shriek of a woman watching the men leave her bombed-out home: “Why?” A year after“Civil War,”a movie predicated on bringing the horror of war home to American soil, Garland has returned with a film even more designed to implode fanciful and far-away ideas of war by bringing it acutely close. Mendoza, an Iraq War veteran who served as a consultant on “Civil War,” co-writes and co-directs “Warfare” from his own first-hand experience in Iraq. The movie is introduced as based on the memories of the troops involved, and “Warfare” gives little reason to quibble with its ultra verisimilitude.  That doesn’t mean Mendoza and Garland’s film isn’t without its sympathies. For a movie quaking with sonic tremors, the first thumps sounded in “Warfare” come from the 2004 music video to Eric Prydz’s “Call on Me,” as the battalion bops in harmony to the female bodies gyrating on a screen in front of them. In battle, they are hardly any less choreographed. If a mode of American war movie leans toward showing the follies of war on the ground, the soldiers of “Warfare” — while not immune to a little “Call on Me” imitation — are supremely precise. When things go haywire here, it’s not because the SEALs aren’t alert or are haphazard in their regard for the lives around them. A scene from “Warfare.” (A24 via AP)  Among them are sniper Elliott (Cosmo Jarvis), Eric (Will Poulter), Tommy (Kit Connor), Sam (Joseph Quinn) and Ray (D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai). We never learn anything about any of them except their fidelity to their comrades and their willingness to do what’s necessary when even the heaviest fire is raining down on them. Sounds of fire pop through the immersive sound design of Glenn Freemantle. Whether “Warfare” is the most accurate war film ever made or not, it’s certainly among the most sonically enveloping experiences of battle. After an explosion rocks the men, “Warfare” staggers in a concussed haze. The film’s craft, generally, is impressive, including production designer Mark Digby’s recreation of the Ramadi block. Despite all the effort to shed “Warfare” of war-movie tropes, though, they do intrude in one glaring way. Like countless movies before it, “Warfare” runs its credits alongside photographs of the real SEALs (some faces are blurred out), along with footage of them with the actors and filmmakers on set. To honor the real men is, of course, laudable and necessary. But the behind-the-scenes tone of the epilogue chafes with the spell cast by “Warfare.” The point of “Warfare,” to me, seems less about paying these Navy SEALs tribute than showing combat how it truly unspools — messily, chaotically and pointlessly. With the exception of a pair of Iraqi interpreters, “Warfare” — despite its broad title — limits itself to one side of a battle. But I’d argue the only bad guy in “Warfare” isn’t on either side of the fight, but is found in the aerial viewpoint — used sporadically by the filmmakers — from a U.S. plane overhead that renders every person mere pixels on a screen. A scene from “Warfare.” (A24 via AP)  In this forensic portrait of war, the only way to not get what’s happening on the ground is to be too far from it. François Truffaut famously said there’s no such thing as an anti-war film because movies inherently glamorize war. “Warfare,” though, is intent on challenging that old adage. “Warfare,” an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for intense war violence and bloody/grisly images, and language throughout.

"Movie Review: Rami Malek wants revenge in starry, globetrotting action pic ‘The Amateur’",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2085,AP News,Lindsey Bahr,8-04-25,"BeforeJack Ryanwas introduced into the culture, Robert Littell imagined Charlie Heller, a quiet, CIA cryptographer who goes rogue on a quest for vengeance after his love is killed by terrorists. As star of “The Amateur,” in theaters Friday,Rami Malekgets to be both skittish nerd and coolly competent angel of death. He’s the homebody and perpetual rule-follower who in grief-stricken madness decides to blackmail his bosses and go on an international killing spree to get the people responsible for her death. The story is based on a book published in 1981 — a product of its Cold War context that was even made into a movie starring John Savage. But even with the Iron Curtain and the Holocaust in its DNA, it also has the kind of foundation that’s essentially evergreen in Hollywood. There’s tragedy, drama, cinematic globetrotting and a fish-out-of-water story that’s a little more relatable than watching some preternaturally talented superspy (at least in theory). In this newest take, credited to screenwriters Ken Nolan and Gary Spinelli and directed by James Hawes, the story has been updated for the modern age, with decidedly murky international politics and sophisticated facial and voice recognition software that can identify masked terrorists and their networks and find rogue agents in an instant. The locations are many: London, Paris, Marseille, Istanbul included. The cast is stacked: Laurence Fishburne is a veteran assassin who agrees to train Charlie,Rachel Brosnahanis the dead wife, Julianne Nicholson is the CIA director, Holt McCallany is Charlie’s shady boss. Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe and Michael Stuhlbarg also play pivotal roles. And anyone who has seen the trailer has already gotten a preview of the most impressive set piece, involving a glass infinity pool.  “The Amateur” has a lot going for it -- but it takes also takes a while to get going. Once it does, it can’t quite maintain a level of energy and suspense needed to justify its runtime. This might be because the film is attempting to be something that’s equal parts action-packed and meditative, but for us that means listening to several conversations about the nature of killing that start to sound quite repetitive. There’s this throughline that Charlie is not a born killer. While a court of law might disagree, everyone in this film seems to think that there’s something different between shooting someone point blank and, say, setting up an elaborate trap that you know will result in a death. Still, it seems like that is a debate that could end after he does intentionally kill someone and goes looking for more. It’s interesting what a film like this chooses to focus on and what it disregards. At the beginning, Charlie declines his wife’s invitation to accompany her to London, where she will of course die. He regrets this deeply, but we’re also told that he always declines: He doesn’t travel internationally almost as a rule. Why? Unclear, but you’d think perhaps this might factor into the plot somehow as he begins his globetrotting. Instead, it’s not an issue at all: He capably navigates all manner of transport across Europe, from cargo flights to busses full of migrants. There are other underdeveloped curiosities, like Jon Bernthal as a cool guy superspy with basically two scenes that don’t seem to advance the story at all. And don’t get me started on poor Brosnahan as the dead wife who we’re constantly being told “mattered” but who we know so little about. Sarah is often seen in flashback in flowy floral dresses doting on her quirky husband in their idyllic Virginia farmhouse. To the film’s credit, they don’t show her laughing under white sheets. But perhaps this is asking too much of a big screen spy spectacle in which Malek is compelling as an unlikely vigilante — even if we might not totally understand why he’s decided this is the only way. He doesn’t exactly sell it the way Harrison Ford was able to in “Patriot Games,” though that’s an unfair bar. WithJames Bondin a reset mode andEthan Hunt promising final reckonings, most of the good globetrotting spy thrillers seem to have migrated to the small screen lately. Something about the episodic nature of it suits the genre, whether it’s“Slow Horses,”“Black Doves”or even “Jack Ryan.” But, as with“Black Bag”from earlier this year, it’s always welcome when we get an offering on the big screen: They just look better there. “The Amateur,” a 20th Century Studios release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for “some strong violence and language.” Running time: 123 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",Entertainment,1
Movie Review: Naomi Watts and a Great Dane mourn Bill Murray in ‘The Friend’,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2086,AP News,Lindsey Bahr,2-04-25,"Having it all means different things to everyone, but a rent-controlled apartment in Manhattan is probably pretty close to a universal dream — even for non-New Yorkers. It’s easy enough, then, to understand the profound conundrum facing Iris (Naomi Watts), a writer and professor who suddenly finds herself with a 150-pound Great Dane wardafter an unexpected death in “The Friend.” Not only is her place a mere 500 square feet, but it’s also one of those pesky buildings in which dogs are not welcome. Not even the cute, well-behaved ones. Dog lovers may find the choice simple (perhaps it should be) and the apartment rules cruelly restrictive, but this is a single woman living a writer’s life in one of the most expensive cities in the world. And now she’s grappling with the idea of saying goodbye to a major part of her identity because her dear friend and mentor Walter (Bill Murray) died without leaving behind a plan for his beloved dog Apollo (Bing). Or perhaps that’s not entirely true: Iris was the plan. Walter just didn’t tell her that before he killed himself. She’s not even a self-proclaimed dog person. The film is an adaptation ofSigrid Nunez’s National Book Award-winning novelof the same name, made by filmmaking duo Scott McGehee and David Siegel (“What Maisie Knew”). Its appeal isn’t mysterious — it’s a classic New York movie about the most romantic New York profession, writing, with actors like Murray and Watts (and Bing) leading the charge. These are characters who’ve lived lives, too. Walter died a celebrated but problematic author, known for his womanizing and multiple marriages. He left behind not just Apollo but three ex-wives (Carla Gugino, Constance Wu and Noma Dumezweni), a grown daughter (Sarah Pidgeon) not conceived in wedlock and a misconduct accusation. Iris and Walter also had a dalliance at one point, but settled into a friendship — his deepest, we’re told.  This is perhaps the most mysterious element of the story — partially on purpose, since Walter is dead for most of the movie. We see him only in limited flashbacks and Murray wears the part well: a freewheeling, egotistical genius whose ways have skipped out of sync with the times but whose charisma keeps him surrounded by throngs of admirers. And afterward, Iris is questioning what it all meant and perhaps how well she really did know this man: It’s a kind of grief, that of a friend, that isn’t regularly explored in films. Iris is the most radical of female characters, even, depressingly in 2025: a single woman of a certain age and no ambition to be anything else. Watts plays her with grace and dignity, as she struggles with her own writing. Even Apollo has a past: Walter found him alone in Central Park one day and took him in as his own. When Walter’s gone, Apollo is perhaps the most outwardly depressed about the loss. His days are spent either sitting sadly on Iris’ bed with literal hangdog eyes or acting out and destroying things in her apartment. It’s no spoiler to say that they’ll both have to go on a journey to realizing that perhaps they can find solace in one another in the devastating absence of their larger-than-life friend. McGehee and Siegel avoid hokey dog movie cliches and easy jokes about ownership learning curves and instead present a rather straightforward portrait of what it’s like to suddenly inherit a very large living creature. “The Friend” stretches on a bit too long, but it’s done with such care and a kind heart that it’s not hard to give it two hours of your time. It’s also one of those movies people complain they don’t make anymore, although its existence is a reminder that they do still make “them,” meaning smart, emotionally authentic stories about people who seem real. They just might require a little more effort to find than they used to. “The Friend,” a Bleecker Street release now in limited release and in theaters nationwide Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “a sexual reference and language.” Running time: 123 minutes.

Movie Review: Jason Momoa shines in ‘A Minecraft Movie’,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2087,AP News,Mark Kennedy,2-04-25,"The latest IP to be mined into a Hollywood blockbuster is appropriately a video game that celebrates digging:“A Minecraft Movie.” Like“The Super Mario Bros. Movie”and“Jumanji”before it, “A Minecraft Movie” centers on four misfits who enter a mysterious portal that pulls them into a strange land, this time cubic, like Lego only on shrooms. The Jared Hess-directed action-adventure artfully straddles the line between delighting preteen gamers and keeping their parents awake. It’s an often-bananas adaptation, with bizarre digressions into turquoise blouses and tater tot pizzas. It hasJennifer Coolidgebeing very Jennifer Coolidge. Need we say more? If you’ve never heard of “Minecraft” — or its denizens like Creepers, Piglins, Villagers and Endermen — you are in big trouble. Consult with the closest 10-year-old immediately. (I have one and he noticed a sweet nod to the late YouTuber Technoblade, an Easter egg of sorts.) The movie is faithful to the world of the game, while adding some things — orbs and crystals — to aid the plot. But if you come in cold and spot pandas and folks punching through earth, you’ll likely side with one human character who says: “This place makes no sense.” Danielle Brooks, from left, Emma Myers, Sebastian Hansen, Jennifer Coolidge, Jack Black and Jason Momoa. (Photo by Scott A Garfitt/Invision/AP)  Our travelers — a sweet brother and sister (Emma Myers and Sebastian Eugene Hansen), their nutty real estate agent(Danielle Brooks)and a deeply dumb, washed-up pro video game player(Jason Momoa)— are guided byJack Black,playing an expert crafter named Steve stranded in the world.  If it does anything, “A Minecraft Movie” marks the comedic coming of age of Momoa, who has shown glimpses of his chops in the“Aquaman”and“Fast X”movies. But when he’s not on screen in this one, it leaves the movie slack, which is saying a lot when you have Black being his full-force, over-the-top Black. “There’s no ‘i’ in ‘team’ but there are two ‘i’s in ‘winning,’” Momoa says as Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison, who is fond of fingerless gloves and aBarbie-pinkleather jacket with a fringe. In another scene, he notes: “Paper doesn’t grow on trees.” The screenplay written by Chris Bowman, Hubbel Palmer, Neil Widener, Gavin James and Chris Galletta is as loosey-goosey as you’d expect from five different voices, with a traditional Marvel-style battle at the end fueled by plenty of “Let’s do this!” declarations but with a surprisingly goofball first half. Like countless films before it, “A Minecraft Movie” is all about the quest to go home, which in this case means navigating zombies, skeletons shooting fire-tipped arrows and a place called The Nether, a perpetually dark hell where horrible creatures mine for gold. For some reason, the ruler there, a piglike witch, has glowing eyes and a British accent. Black, Brooks and Momoa. (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)  The writers make some “America’s Got Talent” jokes, Black has a few songs — including a bizarre “Steve’s Lava Chicken” — and we spend an inordinate of time focused on Momoa’s butt, but it all ends in a dance party. The movie has a “Dark Crystal”-meets-“Transformers” vibe, a too-subtle message about financial failure and something about friendship. The filmmakers do have characters throw eggs —at these prices,is that smart? — but they don’t lean enough into the celebration of creativity this movie seemed to promise when it started. Hollywood’s embrace of gaming has been yielding hits such as HBO’s“The Last of Us”and Amazon Prime Video’s series adaptation of the Microsoft-owned “Fallout.” More adaptations are on the horizon this year: “Until Dawn,” “Mortal Kombat 2” and “Five Nights at Freddy’s 2.” A scene from “A Minecraft Movie.” (Warner Bros. Pictures via AP)  As for “A Minecraft Movie,” the advice is this: Come for the Piglins, stay for Momoa, whom you will see spectacularly failing at being bilingual and jujutsu-ing opponents dressed like a member of Skid Row. It’s everything you ever needed. “A Minecraft Movie,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release that’s in theaters Friday, is rated PG for “violence/action, language, suggestive/rude humor and some scary images.” Running time: 101 minutes.

"Movie Review: ‘Freaky Tales’ is a nostalgic, loving, exhausting and very gory ode to ‘80s Oakland",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2088,AP News,Jocelyn Noveck,2-04-25,"Remember what it was like growing up in the East Bay in the ’80s? Ryan Fleck sure does, and vividly. The writer-director, together with partner Anna Boden, has produced a self-described “very weird” (no argument here) love letter to his former home in“Freaky Tales.”But this ode to Oakland contains more than memories. It’s not about the way things happened, Fleck says, but about the way he chooses to remember them. Set in 1987,“Freaky Tales”is certainly creative. It is whimsically visual — think hand-drawn stick figures popping up, comic-book style graphics, or a sudden shift to cartoon mode — and it has Pedro Pascal, never a bad thing. It’s also often heartfelt, even if it ends in a spasm of hatchet-wielding, samurai-sword-slicing, Tarantino-esque gore that, dare we say, doesn’t feel like a love letter to anything — except maybe Tarantino. The real issue is, a lot of us don’t remember growing up in the East Bay because we didn’t. Maybe we’ve never even been there. What’s never quite fleshed out here is why this all should resonate with us — or how these haphazard moments, albeit compelling, weave together in the cohesive way the filmmakers seem to promise. In any case, Oakland in 1987 was “hella wild,” we’re told at the start: the people, the culture, the music, and also a cosmic “bright green glow” — an electricity in the air that may be a gift from aliens, or perhaps augurs the end of the world. The film then moves, in a style reminiscent of Robert Altman’s “Short Cuts,” through four separate yet connected tales happening on one night.  We begin with “Strength in Numbers: The Gilman Strikes Back,” set at 924 Gilman, home to the Berkeley punk rock scene. A sign on the club’s door expresses its peaceful ethos: “No Racism, No Sexism, No Homophobia, No Drugs, No Alcohol, No Violence.” But try telling that to the local band of skinheads who’ve been rampaging through the joint, terrorizing the crowd. Usually, the punk kids don’t fight back. This time, they do. Young couple Tina (Ji-young Yoo) and Lucid (Jack Champion) are among those who arm themselves with terrifying weapons, including Tina’s fearsome spiked bracelet, for a blood-spattered confrontation. It’s at another East Bay nightspot, Sweet Jimmie’s, where aspiring female rap duo Danger Zone makes its mark in the second story, “Don’t Fight the Feeling.” Entice (singer Normani) and Barbie (Dominique Thorne) take their shot by agreeing to a rap battle with homegrown star rapper Too $hort (played here by Symba), who launches the contest in the raunchiest of ways. Normani and Thorne are engaging, but the story is short on narrative heft. Things get deeper in “Born to Mack,” with Pascal as a once-violent debt collector trying to turn a corner. As his very pregnant wife sits outside in their car, their new life beckoning, Pascal’s Clint goes into a video store where in a back room, his last collection job awaits — or so he thinks. An unwelcome reminder of his violent past sets in motion an unthinkable tragedy. And from tragedy comes an unexpected chance at redemption. Everything comes together — in a way — in “The Legend of Sleepy Floyd,” revolving around a real-life sports drama: the May 1987 game in which Golden State Warriors guard Eric “Sleepy” Floyd went on a scoring rampage — including 29 points in the fourth quarter — to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers. Here, the filmmakers envision an unhappy coda to the night. A band of thieves led by a fiendish corrupt cop (Ben Mendelsohn) has broken into players’ houses while they’re away. When the mother and girlfriend of Sleepy himself come home early, yet another tragedy ensues. And then comes the finale, with Sleepy (Jay Ellis) exacting bloody revenge in a paroxysm of gore. Fans of such things will undoubtedly enjoy it; what the movie is saying about Oakland, however, remains elusive. We won’t spoil the A-list cameo performance, but in the end, as the credits roll, this celebrity returns for sort of a blooper reel moment, cracking up the crew. It’s fun to feel everyone laughing together, and even more fun to watch thevintage breakdancing numberthat accompanies the credits. Clearly, the cast had a great time. But for us, there’s a sense by then that maybe you sorta had to be there. “Freaky Tales,” a Lionsgate release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association “for strong bloody violence, language throughout including slurs, sexual content and drug use.” Running time: 106 minutes.

"Movie Review: Jason Statham takes on the mob in ‘A Working Man,’ a blue-collar action thriller",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2089,AP News,Mark Kennedy,26-03-25,"Jason Stathamis cosplaying a construction laborer when “A Working Man” begins. He’s making sure the rebar is spaced correctly and the concrete is correctly mixed. But we all know where his real strengths are: Beating up people, ferociously. Soon enough — faster than this one-time springboard diving champion used to hit the water — Statham will be doing what he does best in an action movie made by millionaires that hopes to tap into blue-collar chic. Statham plays a sort of hero-laying-low in director and co-writer David Ayer’s latest collab — they previously teamed up on“The Beekeeper”— with the addition of a co-writer who knows a thing or two about lone-wolf underdogs —Sylvester Stallone. When the 19-year-old daughter of his boss is snatched during a night out with girlfriends in Chicago, they turn to Statham, a former anti-terrorist commando for the UK’s Royal Marines, which at least explains the British accent. Jason Statham and David Harbour. (Dan Smith/Amazon MGM Studios via AP)  But he can’t help them — he’s given up that old life. “I’m a different person now,” he says. It’s not who I am anymore.” Admittedly, he says this shortly after fighting off a gang messing with one of his workers, attacking them with a bucket of nails. an ax and a bag of gravel. He’s a widower and a single father saving up money to fight — legally this time — for more custody by sleeping in his Ram truck. His in-laws want to limit his visitation, alleging he suffers from PTSD, a very cynical use by the movie-makers of a popcorn flick with a body count north of a hundred. “I hurt, too,” he tells his daughter.  A visit to an old military buddy —David Harbour,superb — helps change his mind. “God help them,” says Harbour’s character after the decision is made. He knows what’s in store for anyone getting in the way of Statham’s oddly named Levon Cade (scramble the letters and you get “Novel Aced,” go figure). So begins Statham’s version of“Taken”mixed with a blue-collar version of“John Wick.”Our construction worker-turned-vigilante is reassuring to the family of the missing teen. “I’m gonna bring her home. I promise,” he vows. We soon plunge into an underworld of Russian mobsters, designer drugs, human trafficking, corrupt cops and a vicious biker gang run by a guy who sits on a throne of motorcycle parts. People are waterboarded, shot, stabbed, smashed with animal skulls, blown up by grenades and burned with hot coffee. “All of this is for a girl?” asks one incredulous Russian mob boss, who is hogtied and dangled over his own swimming pool as Statham tortures him while munching on some toast he’s made in his fancy kitchen. Shall we talk about the rich now? The upper-level mobsters wear cravats, bow ties and hold gold-tipped walking sticks. One even wears a cape and uses a cigarette holder, like a sort of Mister Burns from “The Simpsons.” The drug dealers wear buffoonish designer duds, “do business” in restaurant banquets and all have attache cases with stacks of banded money, like it’s still the ‘80s. They are all venal, foppish and perverted. The big finale takes place in a tucked-away farm casino with fancy-dressed fat cats. The movie’s poster. (Amazon MGM Studios via AP)  This is in contrast to Statham, an orange safety vest kind of guy with a soldier’s moral compass. He at one point throws into the air enough $100 bills to buy a Lamborghini. But he’s not doing it the money, even though he needs it. He’s there for the girl. “A Working Man” fetishizes its blue-collar ethic at a time whenextremely wealthy Americanshave taken key roles in the second Donald Trump administration and the world’s richest man,Elon Musk, is slicing at government jobs(Veterans are increasingly facing the burden.)Trump himself donned an orange vestwhen he cosplayed a garbage man on the campaign trail. Everyone loves the working class these days. Anyway, we’re not here for a lesson, we’re here for some ultra-violence. “A Working Man” does it well, especially a struggle in the confined space of a moving van. The plot gets a little stretched over two hours — including a ludicrous motorcycle chase scene when enough bullets are fired at Statham as were expended in the Battle of Fallujah — but a bright moment is having the snatched teen (a very good Arianna Rivas, someone to watch) step into her own power. “A Working Man” is exactly what you expect when you unleash Statham on a noble mission. “You killed your way into this,” he’s told by his buddy. “You’re gonna have to kill your way out of it.” In other words, let Statham work, man. “A Working Man,” an Amazon MGM Studios release in theaters this Friday, is rated R for “strong violence, language throughout and drug content.” Running time: 116 minutes.

Movie Review: ‘The Ballad of Wallis Island’ is the loveliest movie of the year (so far),https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2090,AP News,Lindsey Bahr,26-03-25,"It’s never a bad time for a film like“The Ballad of Wallis Island,”but at the moment it feels like a much-needed balm. Modest in scope and made with the lightest of touch, not unlike the lovely folk songs that populate its soundtrack, it’s also deceptively powerful: A gentle ode to moving on, in quirky packaging. This is a movie about a kind, chatty man named Charles (Tim Key) who invites his favorite folk band to play a concert on the remote island where he lives alone in a massive old home. Charles is a semi-recluse only by circumstance: He’s holed himself up in this home full of eccentric acquisitions over the years after a lucky lottery win (there’s another punchline there, but I won’t spoil it). Wallis Island, though beautiful and serene, with white cliffs and rocky shores (it was shot in Wales), is not the kind of place where there’s a lot of socializing, but there is quite a bit of time for reflection, hobbies and, probably, talking to oneself at length. And Charles’s greatest passion is McGwyer Mortimer (Tom Basden andCarey Mulligan), a once popular folk group who have not been together, professionally or romantically, for almost a decade. That this is to be a reunion is terrible news for Herb McGwyer (Basden), who has made a name for himself as a solo artist and who arrives first, already aggrieved about the decisions that have led him here. All he seems to know is that it’s a small gig that will get him a cool half million pounds, which will effectively finance his next album. Everything else about this journey to Wallis Island comes as an unwelcome surprise, starting with the fact that there’s no dock, no car, no hotel and he’s stuck as Charles’ houseguest. The owner of the small general store (Sian Clifford, always a welcome presence) does not even carry rice, which Herb needs to dry out his water damaged phone. That’s a special order. And then Nell Mortimer (Mulligan) arrives, new husband, Michael (Akemnji Ndifornyen) in tow. Herb, faced now with his ex, has no phone and no escape plan: The one man who ferries people to and from the main island doesn’t even keep a reliable schedule (the boat times are listed with a disclaimer: “sometimes”).  Nell, meanwhile, is ready to perform with her old beau. She needs the money, but has also moved on with her life — making chutney in the Pacific Northwest, and seems to be in a good place. Herb remains the put-upon artist, a ball of childish anxiety and ego who has since sold out and seems to regret how things transpired with Nell so many years ago. And then there’s Charles who is simply elated to be in the presence of these two. It’s a fun group of somewhat conflicting interests to mash together. Carey Mulligan, left, and Tom Basden in a scene from “The Ballad of Wallis Island.” (Focus Features via AP)  Once the bickering subsides, Nell and Herb will get to reconnect over their shared music, though someone will of course take the wrong message from it. And it’s all a delight to watch: Mulligan and Basden are sublime together, naturally exuding the awkward chemistry of artist exes, with Key as the adorable comedic foil. Basden and Key actually co-wrote the script, based on a short film they and director James Griffiths made 18 years ago. It’s still early days for 2025 movie releases, and far too soon to be making any reasonable declarations about how something is going to stack up with the rest of them by December. But this is a special one for any year. “The Ballad of Wallis Island” is the kind movie that makes it all look so easy — filmmaking, performance, mood, chemistry. It’s not going to dominate any cultural conversations, and probably won’t go the awards route, but it’ll touch your soul if you let it. Like“Juliet, Naked”from several years ago, a kind of spiritual and tonal sibling, it’s an easy one to recommend to just about anyone. “The Ballad of Wallis Island,” a Focus Features release in theaters Friday is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for “some language and smoking.” Running time: 99 minutes.

Movie Review: Even 2 De Niros aren’t quite enough to make ‘Alto Knights’ a successor to ‘Goodfellas’,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2091,AP News,Jocelyn Noveck,19-03-25,"“You’re the actor!” shouts Anna Genovese at her estranged spouse, gangster Vito Genovese, in a courtroom where he’s implausibly claiming he lacks funds to support her. “The best actor in the world! Better than Clark Gable!” And we all chuckle. They probably all chuckled on set, too. Because the man playing Vitoin “The Alto Knights”is none other than Robert De Niro, indeed one of the best actors in the world, revered in our time as Gable was in his. It’s a cute moment and an apt one, too, becauseBarry Levinson’s film,which aims but fails to channel the magic of decades-old mob movies like “Goodfellas” — though penned by the same writer, Nicholas Pileggi — is all about De Niro. Actually, it’s all about De Niro AND De Niro. The man plays both lead roles, feuding mobsters Genovese and Frank Costello, in a story based on real events. Is it a gimmick? Surely. Does it work? Well, there’s the entertainment value — this is De Niro, after all — and if you feel that more De Niro minutes are always better, then it follows that two roles are better than one. Others may feel it has a mob-themed “Parent Trap” vibe, less weighty than it should be given the obviously violent subject matter. Also, “Goodfellas” fans may wonder if the Vito role was once intended for Joe Pesci (the movie’s been in development forever), so similar is the character to that actor’s impulsive, manically suspicious persona. On the other hand, in two brief scenes where the De Niros appear together for momentous meetings, one might be forgiven for wondering if Al Pacino was in line at some point, for a “Heat”-like moment.  Happily, De Niro relies here on makeup, and not de-aging asin “The Irishman,”though it must be said that, at times, his two characters just don’t look different enough. More importantly, “The Alto Knights,” despite its pedigree, doesn’t rise anywhere near the heights of its glorious predecessors. It is, rather, an enjoyable if choppily paced look at a relationship between two men, where unfortunately we’re arriving pretty late in the game. There are, though, a few crackling surprises: that domestic courtroom scene; a tense, televised Senate committee grilling; and finally a climactic gathering of mob bosses in the countryside, with fabulous period vehicles parked on the lawn and sausages on the grill, that’s disrupted in comically sudden fashion. We begin in 1957 in Manhattan. Costello, after a night partying respectably with high society, stops at his swank apartment building. “This one’s for you,” declares the nervous man who shoots him in the head in his lobby. The shooter (Cosmo Jarvis), sent by Genovese, makes a bad mistake, as his boss will remind him later: “You gotta go SEE if they’re dead!” Amazingly, Costello survives. “I shoulda been paying more attention,” says the genteel mobster who favors diplomacy over bloodletting, narrating from the future. We then go back in time to figure out how things got this bad. With the help of vintage photos and footage artfully edited to include actors playing the younger Frank and Vito, we learn the two were good friends as young Italian immigrants on the streets. But when Vito got mixed up in a murder case, he had to flee to Italy — leaving cooler-headed Frank in charge of the business. Years later, Vito returns, and wants his role at the top of the mob family. And so things go south, quickly. The women in their lives mirror the differences between the two men. Costello’s wife of more than 50 years, Bobbie (Debra Messing, making a nice foray into drama), is a loyal partner who urges her husband to retire and leave New York — along with their adorable dogs (De Niro’s own pooches, dressed in mink coats and hats — a costume design Oscar for this canine fashion, please!). Genovese’s wife Anna (Kathrine Narducci, excellent) is a businesswoman — she owns a gay bar — whose fiery union with Vito turns disastrous. A mere glance at Wikipedia will tell you that both Genovese and Costello ultimately died in nonviolent ways. There’s plenty in “The Alto Knights” that you won’t see there — for example, the movie’s version of just who engineered that farmland mob summit, and why. But watching dozens of mobsters run like heck when police happen upon their gathering is a hoot, and it’s hard to beat the moment when two of them insist to suspicious cops: “We’re hunters!” If only such witty moments were more frequent in a two-hour movie that somehow, alas, feels much longer. “The Alto Knights,” a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association “for violence and pervasive language.” Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",Entertainment,1
Movie Review: ‘Snow White’ is no poisoned apple but it doesn’t whistle,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2092,AP News,Jake Coyle,19-03-25,"Mirror mirror on the wall, what’s the fairest Disney live-action remake of them all? Wait, mirror. Hold on a second. Maybe choosing from the likes of “Alice in Wonderland” (2010),“Mulan”(2020) and“The Lion King”(2019) isn’t such a good idea. Mirror, on second thought, what’s on Netflix? Even the most devoted fans would have to acknowledge that these have not been the most illustrious illustrations of Disney magic. At their best (“Pete’s Dragon”? “Cinderella”?) they breathe life into old classics that could use a little updating. At their worst, well,blue Will Smith. Given the rapacious rate of remakes in modern Hollywood, it’s remarkable that it’s taken nearly 90 years for Disney to return to “Snow White.” It means going back to the very foundation of the Mouse House. The 1937 “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” was Disney’s first animated feature; its grosses paid for the studio’s Burbank lot. That legacy of “Snow White,” by comparison, doesn’t do any favors to Marc Webb’s inevitably lesser, inert live-action retread. Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this “Snow White”: to give its singing protagonist (Rachel Zegler) more agency; to expand that notion of “fair” beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time. It wouldn’t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past — a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.  (Disney via AP)  But it’s a tricky thing reworking a fable that’s been around two centuries, and that’s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb’s “Snow White” has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel’s war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there’s a reason “and the Seven Dwarfs” has been stripped from the title) and the alleged “woke”-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate. Despite some gloriously lush production design, “Snow White” — innocent of most of those backlashes though not all — can’t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (“Waiting on a Wish”) struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that’s wrong with this “Snow White” is Zegler’s casting. (Disney via AP)  But like scaffolding that’s been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb’s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives “Snow White” an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this “Snow White,” not 1937’s. You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with “Snow White” is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson’s screenplay remakes Snow White’s story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song “Someday My Prince Will Come” has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be “fair” as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot’s Evil Queen takes over the kingdom. Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father’s rescue. Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in “Snow White” — mortal or CGI — is as stiff as could be. You’re left glumly scorekeeping the updates — one win here, a loss there — while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive. “Snow White,” a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor.

Book Review: Nancy Kwan tells the behind-the-scenes story of playing a Hollywood stereotype,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2093,AP News,Yuri Kageyama,21-04-25,"Demure, submissive and erotic, Suzie Wong is that bigger-than-life stereotype, that caricature Asian women grew up with in the U.S. We may have also secretly hoped to play that geisha-like image to win our wayout of our oppression. But over the years, some of us grew to resent it, fight it and reject it, hoping to claim our true identity and dignity as a person. In “The World of Nancy Kwan,” a memoir by the pioneer Hollywood star, we hear from the real-life woman who played Suzie Wong. We learn an Asian actor getting to play an Asian role was a victory back in those days, as the roles were taken by white actors wearing strange slant-eyed makeup. Kwan was born in Hong Kong in 1939. Her father was Chinese, an architect with a love for movies. Her mother was English, a model and actor, although she left when Kwan was young, and she was raised by a stepmother. It was hard because being Eurasian was an anomaly, she recalls. “I’ve broken barriers, celebrated achievements, overcome disappointments and survived tragedies, all part of my remarkable journey from Hong Kong to Hollywood and beyond. This is my story,” she writes in the prologue. Her book is speckled with the big names of that era, Pat Boone, Katherine Hepburn,Dick Van Dyke.Some passages read like a gossip column, such as her accounts of her friendship withBruce Lee. But she also depicts the racial barriers of that period.  All women, especially in Hollywood, were trying to be beautiful and desirable. In fact, being dubbed “the Asian Bardot,” referring toBrigette Bardot,was a genuine compliment. She talks about how Jack Soo, a Japanese American who portrays a nightclub owner in“Flower Drum Song,”was incarcerated with other Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. Kwan believes her story is about hard work and advancement despite racism, not succumbing to it. After all, Asian actors’ roles used to be limited to “Fu Manchu villains, hypersexualized Dragon Ladies and comic buffoons” and “shopkeepers, maids and houseboys,” according to Kwan. And so getting featured on the cover of Life magazine, wearing a body-hugging cheongsam, counted as a victory. Another big win is when Ross Hunter, a hot producer, rushes over to her at a Hollywood party and casts her in “Flower Drum Song.” The musical film shattered stereotypes, she says, by focusing on fashionably dressed, wealthy Asians. Regardless of race, people cherish family, suffer heartbreak, laugh, sing, dance and dream of happiness, she writes. Kwan calls the work “joyous entertainment with the universal message that whatever our race, we’re all alike.” Even those who may find that message lacking in addressing the meaning of diversity and Asian American pride will acknowledge there is a lot to learn from Kwan’s history. She is simply trying to land roles, hopefully good ones that showcase her talent in works by respected directors. Miyoshi Umeki, her friend and another prominent Asian actor of that period, did not like having to speak pidgin in her roles, but did it because that was her job as a professional. That kind of pain is the legacy being explored in Kwan’s life. Being an Asian in America is what she calls “our shared humanity,” in which “East can meet West and possibly make the world a little better.” ___ Yuri Kageyama is on Threads:https://www.threads.net/@yurikageyama ___ AP book reviews:https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",Entertainment,1
"‘Sinners,’ shot on IMAX film, is a historic first for female cinematographers",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2094,AP News,Lindsey Bahr,18-04-25,"Cinematographer Autumn Durald Arkapaw didn’t realize she was going to make history on“Sinners.”TheRyan Coogler film, now playing in theaters nationwide, marks the first time a female director of photography has shot a movie on large format IMAX film. It was Kodak executive Vanessa Bendetti who texted her the news. “I smiled at the thought,” Arkapaw said in a recent interview. “I felt very proud that Ryan gave me the opportunity.” The format, a favorite offilmmakers like Christopher Nolan, has gained popularity in recent years — not just with directors but withmoviegoers seeking it out as well. Coogler hadn’t originally sought it out for“Sinners”(he had planned on using 16 mm) until Warner Bros. executive Jesse Ehrman asked him if he’d considered large format, which gives moviegoers more resolution and a shallower depth of field. “Just from an exhibition sense in this day and age with folks having so much access to streaming and watching so many things on their phones, it’s nice to have a format like IMAX that can be an experience you can only experience in the theaters,” Coogler told The Associated Press. Coogler and Arkapaw then began a testing process, looking at 70 mm IMAX prints of films like “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “The Hateful Eight” and “Tenet” and consulting with Nolan and his regular cinematographerHoyte van Hoytema. Coogler quickly fell in love with the format and felt it was fitting for the larger-than-life, genre-bending film about vampires, the blues and life in the Jim Crow south in 1932.  “I wasn’t surprised that we were exploring large format,” Arkapaw said. “We shot‘Wakanda Forever’on IMAX, but that was digital. We always talked about true IMAX being ... something that you see and you fall in love with.” Her conversation with Hoytema made her even more excited. The Oscar-winning“Oppenheimer”cinematographer told her not to worry about the size or weight of the equipment and to shoot the movie as she would with any other kind of camera. “Hearing that straight off was inspiring and encouraging and we took that advice and just told our story,” Arkapaw said. “It was very freeing.” In the end, they decided to employ a combination of IMAX film and Ultra Panavision 70, an even rarer format that Quentin Tarantino resurrected for“The Hateful Eight.”This means different scenes have different aspect ratios, which Coogler himself broke downin a video explainer for Kodak. “We’re using these two formats for the very first time,” Coogler said. “It really complements the story, it really complements the setting and it really complements the filmmaking.” One of Arkapaw’s favorite scenes was one they weren’t even initially going to do on IMAX film because it was dialogue heavy and the cameras are notoriously noisy. But if her work on “Wakanda” taught her anything about Coogler, it’s that he’s always looking to push boundaries. The scene is the introduction to Jack O’Connell’s Irish vampire Remmick and the Choctaw trying to hunt him down, which they shot like a Western as the sun sets in the distance. “We had a lot of beautiful crane work in that and some intimate stuff. Ryan loves a hallway, so there’s a Steadicam shot inside. It’s very eerie,” she said. “I can’t see that scene in any other format now.” With “Sinners” out now, the hope is that audiences will seek out the special formats where they can, whether it’s IMAX film or digital. “We want to bring people back to the cinema, get back to theaters,” “Sinners” star Michael B. Jordan said. “I think this is a movie that’s meant to give for the moviegoing experience…it takes you on a ride.” The profession has come a long way since Arkapaw started exploring cinematography as a career path. It wasn’t too long ago that she said she struggled to find many women cinematographers besidesEllen Kuras(“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind”). And while there are more than there were 20 years ago, there are still barriers to be broken, including an Oscar win. Only three have been nominated:Rachel Morrison(who worked with Coogler on “Fruitvale Station” and “Black Panther”) was the first for “Mudbound,” in 2018, followed byAri Wegnerfor “The Power of the Dog” and Mandy Walker for “Elvis.” Arkapaw takes the significance of her landmark seriously. “I heard a phrase that said you need to see you to be you,” she said. “I think for us females in business, the more women are able to shoot on large format, it will inspire the younger girls who maybe don’t think that they can get there.”",Entertainment,1
Takeaways from AP’s report on the religious and moral undercurrents in Superman comics,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2095,AP News,,18-04-25,"Superman comics are not overtly religious. Yet faith and morality have been baked into this superhero character who was born Kryptonian, raised Methodist and created by two young Jewish men in 1930s Cleveland. Superman’s character has been portrayed in the mold of Christ and Moses given how he constantly upholds the ideals of self-sacrifice, powerful leadership and compassion. While scholars, comic book writers and fans alike are struck by the religious undertones in Superman comics, they all agree that what sets Superman apart is his abilityto bring hope in a hopeless world. Friday (April 18) marks the 87th anniversary of the original superhero’s birth. It also is the date Superman made his debut in an Action Comics issue. There is much excitement in the Superman fanverse this year because of the much-anticipated‘Superman’ moviedirected by James Gunn, starring David Corenswet, the first Jewish actor to play Superman in a major film. On his Instagram page on April 18, 2024, Gunn shared a photo of himself,Corenswet and Rachel Brosnahanwho plays Lois Lane in the upcoming film, reading among several comic books, a reproduction of Action Comics #1 — the very first one featuring the Man of Steel. In his Instagram post, Gunn also paid tribute to the superhero, saying: “He gave us someone to believe in, not because of his great physical power, but because of his character and determination to do right no matter what.” Gunn’s film promises a return to a version of a vulnerable Superman who is rooted in values espoused by most faiths — goodness, compassion and hope. Samantha Baskind, professor of art history at Cleveland State University, is Jewish and sees numerous parallels between Superman’s origin story and the history of Jews. She says Superman’s solitary flight from Krypton in a small spacecraft is reminiscent of how Moses’ mother placed him in a papyrus basket and left him on the Nile, seeing it as his best chance of survival. Some also compare Superman’s backstory to the Kindertransport, she said, referring to a humanitarian rescue program that transported nearly 10,000 children, mostly Jewish, from Nazi-controlled territories to Great Britain in 1938 and 1939. In Superman’s Kryptonian name, Kal-El, chosen by his original Jewish creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the “El” in Hebrew connotes God. “There’s also the thinking that Siegel and Shustercreated Supermanbecause they were these two, skinny, young Jewish men who couldn’t go out and fight Hitler, but Superman fought Nazis on the cover of their comic books,” Baskind said. In some early editions, Superman held Hitler by his Nazi uniform as he begged for mercy. Superman is relatable to diverse populations regardless of religion, race or ethnicity. Gene Luen Yang, who has written several Superman comics, sees his own experience as a Chinese American mirrored in Superman’s story — caught between two worlds and two cultures. Yang says he had one name at home and another at school, just like Superman. So, even though he is a practicing Catholic, Yang says he relates more to Superman’s Jewish roots. Despite the religious undertones, Superman also appeals to those who arereligiously unaffiliated, said Dan Clanton, professor of religious studies at Doane University in Nebraska, adding that the superhero’s story “truly encapsulates American civil religion.” Neal Bailey, a longtime contributor to Superman Homepage, a fan site, is an atheist. He views Superman as a “philosophical pragmatist” with the ability to solve the most complex problems with the least amount of harm. “He actually goes beyond religion to see our commonalities,” Bailey said. “Superman wouldn’t care about people’s religious beliefs. He would care more about whether they are living up to their human potential.” Grant Morrison, one of the best-known writers of Superman comic books, said in a 2008 interview that humans become what they imitate, which is why he made Superman an inspirational character. Superheroes have received less-than-flattering treatment in recent films and television shows. For example, in “The Boys,” a comic book turned Amazon Prime series, the Superman-like character, Homelander, is a government-sponsored hero whose smiling exterior conceals the heart of a sadist. Gunn’s Superman is expected to change that trajectory with a superhero who will reinforce the character’s core value of preserving life at any cost. An altruistic view of Superman can be found in the recently concluded “Superman & Lois” television series on the CW Network in which after defeating Lex Luthor in a final battle, the couple settles down in a small town and starts a foundation to help others. “I didn’t just want to be a hero that saves people,” the Superman character played by Tyler Hoechlin says in an epilogue to the series. “I wanted to connect with them. To change their lives for the better.” ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’scollaborationwith The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Book Review: How would Joan Didion feel about her therapy session notes being published as a book?,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2097,AP News,Anita Snow,21-04-25,"What would Joan think? Reading the newly released “Notes to John,” it’s hard not to wonder how the late authorJoan Didionwould feel about having her personal notes from a series of painful therapy sessions converted into a book after her death. Discovered in a small filing cabinet in Didion’s office aftershe diedin 2021 at age 87, the 150 loose pages formed a kind of journal she kept for her husband, writer John Gregory Dunne, about her meetings starting in late 1999 with psychiatrist Roger MacKinnon. The writer of such cult favorites as “The Book of Common Prayer” (1977) and “The White Album” (1979) was an assiduous notetaker and recordkeeper who explained her lifelong compulsion to write things down in her well-known essay, “On Keeping a Notebook,” to remember what certain moments had meant to her. Still, the pages weren’t exactly a secret. They were included in papers that were placed by Didion’s heirs, her late brother’s children, without restrictions on access in the Didion/Dunne archive at the New York Public Library. Much of the writings in the book released by Knopf center on the couple’s adult daughter, Quintana Roo Dunne, who was adopted as a baby and named after a Mexican territory that later became a state. In the notes to Dunne, the famously guarded Didion details her worries and guilt about Quintana’s chronic alcoholism more openly than she did in the books she later wrote on that painful period.  “The Year of Magical Thinking” (2005) focused on Dunne’s fatal heart attack in 2003, and “Blue Nights” (2011) mourned her death just two years later at age 39 from acute pancreatitis. “He wanted to know how old Quintana was when we got her, the details of the adoption,” Didion writes to Dunne about one session with MacKinnon. “We talked at some length about that, and I said I had always been afraid we would lose her. Whale watching. The hypothetical rattlesnake in the ivy on Franklin Avenue.’ Some of the most poignant passages are about the numerous dreams she described to the psychiatrist about her daughter’s addiction. The hopelessness and vulnerability she acknowledges belie Didion’s cool and controlled public image. “I told him about the dream I had this week in which Quintana and I were sharing a room and every time I woke during the night she wasn’t in her bed, she was sitting by the window and she was getting drunker and drunker,” Didion writes. “And there was nothing I could do about it. She couldn’t see me watching her.” ___ AP book reviews:https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",Entertainment,1
Book Review: ‘Hope Dies Last’ visits visionaries fighting global warming,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2098,AP News,Jeff Rowe,21-04-25,"Alan Weisman has found an all-world cast of scientists, engineers and environmentalists who have dreamed big and worked passionately torepair some of the world’s wrecked ecosystemsand also to develop processes that, for example, use far less energy than we get from oil Take Azzam Alwash, for example. An engineer, he lamented destruction of thousands of square miles of marshes in Iraq that date to Biblical times and were his birthplace. Birds, fish and other animals flourished in the wetlands untilSaddam Husseindrained them to flush out enemies to his regime. The wetlands in the world’s hottest region were thought beyond resurrection. Weisman writes that to Alwash, however, “impossible often masks a lack of imagination.” He marshaled the resources to restore much of the wetlands and a miracle followed: wildlife returned.. Some of Weisman’s chapters will make readers wish they had paid more attention in high school science and chemistry classes. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have made astonishing progress in developing commercial-scale fusion energy that could produce great quantities of clean energy. Such breakthroughs are critical on a planet now dependent on fossil fuels, which produce carbon dioxide that traps heat in the atmosphere. To those who scoff at mentions of human-caused environmental catastrophe as a hoax or fake news, consider this: Weisman’s bibliography runs 74 pages. And the type is small. He spent several years researching and reporting on this book and visited a dozen countries.  “As long as we let them keep on, there is hope,” writes Weisman, referring to the people he writes about in this book. News also has overtaken the publication of this book. President Trump’s threats to withholdmoney from Harvard and other universitieswould have a drastic effect because so many of the world’s brightest students come to study at American research universities, contributing to the steady stream of American scientific breakthroughs. Weisman set out to find inspirational people doing extraordinary work to save the planet. He found them and their work can save us from writing a catastrophic next chapter for our earth. Global warming skeptics often assert that some of the people Weisman calls visionaries are misguided nature enthusiasts, but what could we lose in making the planet cleaner and greener? Nothing, and our children and grandchildren will be grateful. ___ AP book reviews:https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",Entertainment,1
Book Review: Sara Jafari’s ‘Things Left Unsaid’ is a tale of tentative lovers who keep connecting,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2099,AP News,Aroun Rashid Deen,21-04-25,"Sara Jafari’s “Things Left Unsaid” is a love-craving, tumbling tale of two Iranian British friends who first meet in high school — the self-skeptic and pessimist Shirin Bayat, and the traumatized Kian Rahimi. Kian was 15 years old when his older brother, Mehdi, was incarcerated and blames himself partly for what happened. Shirin, for her part, battles anxiety and depression. In high school in the northern English city of Hull, Shirin falls in love with Kian, her only close male friend, but she can’t open up to him about it. Kian feels the same about Shirin; he fancies her and imagines her lips on his, but kept it quiet. Shirin and Kian both went their separate ways after school until 10 years later when they unexpectedly meet again at a friend’s party in London. They have a lot in common: They have both faced discrimination — they were their school’s only two non-white students and now Shirim finds the same situation at work. Shirin kept thinking of Kian throughout the decade-long separation. Even though Shirin kept in touch with her female friends from her high school days, she always had a sense of unfulfillment, a sense of pessimism and skepticism. Her parents had separated when she was in college. “Shirin thinks there is an ugliness inside her sometimes, some kind of repressed anger that she takes out on other people in her mind,” the author writes.  But her thoughts of Kian, and her desire for them to be together again one day, give her a sense of hope and relief. When the two reunite again in London at their friend Millie’s 27th birthday party, Shirin’s love for her old friend resurfaces. But it comes a little too late: Salma, who Kian was now seeing, is also at the party. Shirin even asks Kian to kiss her, but he doesn’t because she’s drunk. These would-be lovers have one final meeting — at a dinner party in New York in 2020, where Kian is now living. She confesses to having a lot of regrets and that she had been thinking about him during their decade-long separation. Kian confesses he had imagined her kissing him while they were in school. “Why didn’t we make it work?” Kian asks, adding that he wanted it to. Shirin responds with “I want that, too…” Could this time be the time they finally get together? Or has a gulf developed between them? Beautifully written in simple language, the London-based British Iranian author Jafari continuously pulls anxious readers along to find out what becomes of Shirin’s and Kian’s craving for each other. ___ AP book reviews:https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews",Entertainment,1

The “book brigade” of around 300 people stood in two lines running along a sidewalk in downtown Chelsea on Sunday, passing each title from Serendipity Books’ former location directly to the correct shelves in the new building, down the block and around the corner on Main Street. “It was a practical way to move the books, but it also was a way for everybody to have a part,” Michelle Tuplin, the store’s owner, said. “As people passed the books along, they said ‘I have not read this’ and ‘that’s a good one.’” Momentum had been building since Tuplin announced the move in January. “It became so buzzy in town. So many people wanted to help,” she said Tuesday. Tuplin said the endeavor took just under two hours — much shorter than hiring a moving company to box and unbox the thousands of titles. The brigade even put the books back on the shelves in alphabetical order. Now Tuplin hopes to have the new location open within two weeks. The bookstore has been in Chelsea, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) west of Detroit, since 1997. Tuplin has been the owner since 2017 and has three part-time employees. About 5,300 people call Chelsea home and residents described it as a place where neighbors help neighbors.  “It’s a small town and people just really look out for each other,” said Kaci Friss, 32, who grew up in Chelsea and has worked at the bookstore for a little over a year. “Anywhere you go, you are going to run into someone you know or who knows you, and is going to ask you about your day.” Friss said Sunday’s book brigade reminded her of “how special this community is.”",Entertainment,1
Keri Hilson’s ‘We Need to Talk’ marks her return to music after a 15-year absence,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2101,AP News,Gary Gerard Hamilton,19-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) —The last time Keri Hilson put out an album, Barack Obama was in the second year of his first term as U.S. president, the iPad was released and Instagram was brand new. “On some days, I’m like that was just a blink away. But for the most part, yeah, it feels like a long time because I’ve been waiting. I felt stagnant, I felt stuck for a while, and conflicted,” said the two-time Grammy-nominated artist. “I’m very much approaching this like I’m starting over because that’s how it feels to me. I’ve lived nine lives since I last released … I’m a whole different person.” Hilson, the 42-year-old R&B star known for late 2000s hits like “Knock You Down,” featuring Kanye West and Ne-Yo. and “Pretty Girl Rock,”released “WE NEED TO TALK: LOVE” on Friday. It’s her third album, following 2010’s “No Boys Allowed,” and is the first of a trilogy set for release this year. Led by the sultry single “Bae,” the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection. “I feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,” explained Hilson, who said she’s never stopped recording. “There were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn’t really love that I had to sing … I didn’t want to feel like that this time around.”  One of those songs was a leaked remix to her popular 2009 single “Turnin Me On” featuring Lil Wayne, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics includeda diss fans perceived to be aimed at Beyoncé. Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, “In A Perfect World,” which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, “She can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,” assumed to reference Beyoncé’s “Irreplaceable.” She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused. Keri Hilson poses for a portrait on Tuesday, April 8, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton)  Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia’s “The Breakfast Club” after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself. The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music. During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats. “There were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,” said Hilson, who shifted to acting. Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as “new media” outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyoncé, who has never publicly commented on the situation. Hilson “can definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,” said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. “Her core fan base has matured … she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there’s a lot of diversity and sound.” Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, “WE NEED TO TALK: LOVE” finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity. There are quintessential “Ms. Keri Baby” songs like the fun, Pop&B styled “Somethin (Bout U),” but there’s also the introspective “Naked (Love),” and “Say It,” in which she expresses, “I won’t say I love you / ‘til you say you love me.” “I’m very ‘girl boss’ in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. … I prefer for the man to say ‘I love you’ first. I just prefer for a man to lead,” said Hilson. “I’m really a damsel – without the distress.” The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam “Scream,” while the bright “Whatever” floats with beautiful stacked harmonies. “I feel like it’s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,” said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. “This reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.” Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career. “It’s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback … it feels more personal,” said Samuels. “The other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.” Keri Hilson poses for a portrait on Tuesday, April 8, 2025, in New York. (AP Photo/Gary Gerard Hamilton)  Hilson says she’s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, “Fame: A Temptations Story,” co-starring Keshia Chanté, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career. Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it. “I just control what I can control … I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I’ve had since I’ve been away,” said Hilson. “I feel unburdened … I’m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.” ___ Follow Associated Press entertainment journalist Gary Gerard Hamilton at @GaryGHamilton on all his social media platforms.",Entertainment,1
Katy Perry gears up for sci-fi inspired world tour,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2102,AP News,Krysta Fauria,18-04-25,"ONTARIO, Calif. (AP) — In less than a year,Katy Perryhas released an album, campaigned for Vice PresidentKamala Harrisand, just this week,flown to space.As she heads to Mexico City to kick off a world tour on Wednesday, the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down. “I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told The Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts are so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.” With that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavor will be a victory. Her September album, “143,” wascritically panned,and she was simultaneously criticized for reuniting withembattled producer Dr. Luke.Celebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowskicritiqued the spaceflight’suse of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump. But Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, “I Kissed a Girl,” are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, “Roar.” “I can control what I can control,” she said. That mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of Transcendental Meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including — perhaps most zealously — the lateDavid Lynch,whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.  “That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said. Perry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.” “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolized.” That journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi themed “Lifetimes Tour.” Citing films like “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element” as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces. “It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.” Perry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flare to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained. In the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue in cheek lyricism — in line with her “very sarcastic” sense of humor — and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn’t stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.” “I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard ‘Teenage Dream,’” she said.",Entertainment,1
Drake complains about Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ Super Bowl performance in new defamation claims,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2103,AP News,Dave Collins,18-04-25,"Hip hop superstarDrakeis now complaining about rival rapperKendrick Lamar’sperformance of “Not Like Us” at this year’s Super Bowl, adding it to hisdefamation lawsuitagainst Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake. “The Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,” says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan. It adds, “It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.” Although Lamar removed the word “pedophile” that’s in the track duringthe halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that “nearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,” the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance. “Drake’s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,” his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. “Drake will expose the evidence of UMG’s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.” This year’s Super Bowl and its halftime show werethe most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.  In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake’s allegations. “Drake, unquestionably one of the world’s most accomplished artists and with whom we’ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,” the company said. “It is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue.” A spokesperson for Drake said in a prepared release that the artist is “holding the largest music conglomerate in the world accountable for its actions and doing so without fear.” The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of “Not Like Us” were played at theGrammy Awardsin February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony. Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted “Not Like Us” despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice. The result, the suit says, was intrudersshooting a security guardat Drake’s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand’s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations. Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-oldPulitzer Prize winnerwith 22 Grammy wins, have beenbeefing for years.The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years. The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar’s “Not Like Us.” “Say, Drake, I hear you like ’em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,” Lamar raps. In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar. “Plaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,” the motion says. “Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.”",Entertainment,1
The Black Crowes and Jimmy Page revisit a unique 25-year-old live set,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2104,AP News,Mark Kennedy,15-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — One of the more puzzling live albums of all time came out in 2000. It featured songs from a two-night stand withThe Black Crowesand Led Zeppelin iconJimmy Page. But fans hoping to hear “Hard to Handle” or “She Talks to Angels” were out of luck. Bizarrely, not a single Black Crowes song was on it. Twenty-five years later, that misstep has been fixed. The 36-track “Jimmy Page & The Black Crowes: Live at the Greek,” restores 16 previously unreleased songs and offers a better window into a unique trans-Atlantic rock combination. “The whole project was special, very electric for us, very something very alive,” says singer-songwriter Chris Robinson. “I think we were all — for lack of a better word — just abuzz with what we were doing as a band, as an outfit together.” The live tracks were recorded at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles over two nights in October 1999. It captured musicians who were cooking after previous stops at New York City’s Roseland Ballroom; the Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts; and The Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan. “I think we really felt like it wasn’t the Black Crowes with Jimmy Page. It was one thing, it was one group,” says Chris Robinson. “We really felt connected and tied. I just think we just had a really high energy level, and we knew we were onto something that was powerful.”  The album that came out had Zeppelin tunes like “Celebration Day,” “In My Time of Dying” and “Whole Lotta Love,” as well as old blues and R&B standards like “Woke Up This Morning,” “Sloppy Drunk,” “Mellow Down Easy” and “Shake Your Money Maker,” plus the Yardbirds′ “Shape of Things to Come” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Oh Well.” But no Black Crowes songs were included due to contractual reasons: The band had just left their label and weren’t allowed to use anything from their catalog. “We were happy with what came out. We were bummed that we weren’t able legally to put our songs on the record,” says songwriter and guitarist Rich Robinson. Adds his brother Chris: “I wasn’t surprised by how inept that decision was.” “I felt really bad about that because they extended this hand of friendship that I could come and join the band,” says Page. “I felt really sad because I knew the versions that we did were really good of their songs.” The anniversary edition of “Live at the Greek” includes the once-dropped Black Crowes’ tunes “No Speak No Slave,” ”Hard to Handle,” “Wiser Time,” “Remedy” and a version of “She Talks to Angels,” which Rich Robinson says Page took “to a totally different direction and a new level.” Zeppelin tunes like “Misty Mountain Hop” and “Bring It on Home” are also included. In addition to Page and the brothers, the band on stage included Sven Pipien on bass, Eddie Harsch on keyboards, Audley Freed on guitar and Steve Gorman on drums. Page says he felt loose and connected with the guys. “In the past, whenever I knew it was going to be recorded, say in the Zeppelin days, I’d always get really nervous,” he says. “But with this, I didn’t have any of that anxiety or anything. We were on a wave.” Fans will delight in the restored songs but also in some outtakes, including five songs at soundcheck and the never-before-released song Rich Robinson and Page wrote while jamming, called simply “Jams.” “I think the surprises are the things that really excite us as well,” says Chris Robinson. “We didn’t even know that we had this extra material or the other things that we hadn’t really thought about until this project came around.” The concerts at The Greek capture a partnership that would endure. Page and the Crowes would go on a full-length American tour in the summer of 2000 and are friends today. “We were all then joined in the hip when we were playing, and it was just such a joyful event to for me to be playing with these guys, and I guess them to be playing with me, too,” says Page. The album re-release comes as The Black Crowes are enjoying a creative patch, earningtheir second career Grammynod last year for “Happiness Bastards,” nominated for best rock album alongside the Rolling Stones. Chris Robinson is philosophical about the timing of the anniversary release. Despite the songs sitting in a vault for a quarter of a century, he’s just happy they can now be heard. “I do have a firm belief that things happen when they’re supposed to happen because they’re supposed to happen,” he says. “And if you play around with that too much, it might not have the same resonance, you know?” ___ This story has been updated to correct the years since the release to 25 instead of 26.",Entertainment,1

Lee Corso to retire from ESPN’s ‘College GameDay’ after four-decade run,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2106,AP News,Associated Press,17-04-25,"Lee Corso’s nearly four-decade run on ESPN’s “College GameDay” is coming to an end. Corso, the longtimeESPN broadcaster and folksy former coachwidely known for his endearing expressions and elaborate headgear picks, is set to retire after a career with the show that began in 1987, ESPN announced Thursday. His final broadcast will be Aug. 30 — Week 1 of the 2025 college football season — and the network said additional programming to celebrate Corso is also planned. “My family and I will be forever indebted for the opportunity to be part of ESPN and ‘College GameDay’ for nearly 40 years,” Corso said in a statement to ESPN. “I have a treasure of many friends, fond memories and some unusual experiences to take with me into retirement.” Corso, who turns 90 in August, began hispopular headgear segmentin October 1996 at a game at Ohio State. Since then, he has gone 286-144 in 430 selections wearing everything from helmets and mascot heads to dressing up as the Fighting Irish leprechaun from Notre Dame, the Stanford tree and historic figures James Madison and Benjamin Franklin. “Not so fast, my friend”is one of his most well-known comments and his good humor alongside Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis and Desmond Howard and many others going back more than three decades helped make Corso and the show a beloved staple for millions on college football Saturdays. “Almost 30 years together. I have enjoyed sitting next to you, watching you do your thing,” Herbstreit said in avideo on social media. “So much fun and so many great moments on the show and off the show. This is a celebration for everything you did. You’re an icon and once in a lifetime person. It has been a special time for all of us. You’ve earned this retirement.”  Corso’s career has lasted through a health scare in 2009, when he suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak for a while. He returned to “College GameDay ”later that year. Though he hasn’t joined his colleagues as much on the road in recent years, Corso was at the site of last year’s national title game between Ohio State and Notre Dame in Atlanta. Corso was a college and pro football coach for 28 years before transitioning to broadcasting. He coached 15 years in college at Louisville, Indiana and Northern Illinois. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign uphere.

"Wink Martindale, the genial game show host and an early TV interviewer of Elvis Presley, dies at 91",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2108,AP News,Beth Harris,16-04-25,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Wink Martindale, the genial host of such hit game shows as “Gambit” and “Tic-Tac-Dough” who also did one of the first recordedtelevisioninterviews with a young Elvis Presley, has died. He was 91. Martindale died Tuesday at Eisenhower Health in Rancho Mirage, California, according to his publicist Brian Mayes. Martindale had been battling lymphoma for a year. “He was doing pretty well up until a couple weeks ago,” Mayes said by phone from Nashville. “Gambit” debuted on the same day in September 1972 as “The Price is Right” with Bob Barker and “The Joker’s Wild” with Jack Barry. “From the day it hit the air, ‘Gambit’ spelled winner, and it taught me a basic tenant of any truly successful game show: KISS! Keep It Simple Stupid,” Martindale wrote in his 2000 memoir “Winking at Life.” “Like playing Old Maids as a kid, everybody knows how to play 21, i.e. blackjack.” “Gambit” had been beating its competition on NBC and ABC for over two years. But a new show debuted in 1975 on NBC called “Wheel of Fortune.” By December 1976, “Gambit” was off the air and “Wheel of Fortune” became an institution that is still going strong today. Martindale bounced back in 1978 with “Tic-Tac-Dough,” the classic X’s and O’s game on CBS that ran until 1985. “Overnight I had gone from the outhouse to the penthouse,” he wrote. He presided over the 88-game winning streak of Navy Lt. Thom McKee, who earned over $300,000 in cash and prizes that included eight cars, three sailboats and 16 vacation trips. At the time, McKee’s winnings were a record for a game show contestant.  “I love working with contestants, interacting with the audience and to a degree, watching lives change,” Martindale wrote. “Winning a lot of cash can cause that to happen.” Martindale wrote that producer Dan Enright once told him that in the seven years he hosted “Tic-Tac-Dough” he gave away over $7 million in cash and prizes. Martindale said his many years as a radio DJ were helpful to him as a game show host because radio calls for constant ad-libs and he learned to handle almost any situation in the spur of the moment. He estimated that he hosted nearly two dozen game shows during his career. Martindale wrote in his memoir that the question he got asked most often was “Is Wink your real name?” The second was “How did you get into game shows?” He got his nickname from a childhood friend. Martindale is no relation to University of Michigan defensive coordinator Don Martindale, whose college teammates nicknamed him Wink because of their shared last name. Born Winston Conrad Martindale on Dec. 4, 1933, in Jackson, Tennessee, he loved radio since childhood and at age 6 would read aloud the contents of advertisements in Life magazine. He began his career as a disc jockey at age 17 at WPLI in his hometown, earning $25 a week. After moving to WTJS, he was hired away for double the salary by Jackson’s only other station, WDXI. He next hosted mornings at WHBQ in Memphis while attending Memphis State. He was married and the father of two girls when he graduated in 1957. Martindale was in the studio, although not working on-air that night, when the first Presley record “That’s All Right” was played on WHBQ on July 8, 1954. Martindale approached fellow DJ Dewey Phillips, who had given Presley an early break by playing his song, to ask him and Presley to do a joint interview on Martindale’s TV show “Top Ten Dance Party” in 1956. By then, Presley had become a major star and agreed to the appearance. Martindale and Presley stayed in touch on occasion through the years, and in 1959 he did a trans-Atlantic telephone interview with Presley, who was in the Army in Germany. Martindale’s second wife, Sandy, briefly dated Presley after meeting him on the set of “G.I. Blues” in 1960. In 1959, Martindale moved to Los Angeles to host a morning show on KHJ. That same year he reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with a cover version of “Deck of Cards,” which sold over 1 million copies. He performed the spoken word wartime story with religious overtones on “The Ed Sullivan Show.” “I could easily have thought, ’Wow, this is easy! I come out here, go on radio and TV, make a record and everybody wants to buy it!” he wrote. “Even if I entertained such thoughts, they soon dissipated. I learned in due time that what had happened to me was far from the ordinary.” A year later he moved to the morning show at KRLA and to KFWB in 1962. Among his many other radio gigs were two separate stints at KMPC, owned by actor Gene Autry. His first network hosting job was on NBC’s “What’s This Song?” where he was credited as Win Martindale from 1964-65. He later hosted two Chuck Barris-produced shows on ABC: “Dream Girl ’67” and “How’s Your Mother-in-Law?” The latter lasted just 13 weeks before being canceled. “I’ve jokingly said it came and went so fast, it seemed more like 13 minutes!” Martindale wrote, explaining that it was the worst show of his career. Martindale later hosted a Las Vegas-based revival of “Gambit” from 1980-81. He formed his own production company, Wink Martindale Enterprises, to develop and produce his own game shows. His first venture was “Headline Chasers,” a coproduction with Merv Griffin that debuted in 1985 and was canceled after one season. His next show, “Bumper Stumpers,” ran on U.S. and Canadian television from 1987-1990. He hosted “Debt” from 1996-98 on Lifetime cable and “Instant Recall” on GSN in 2010. Martindale returned to his radio roots in 2012 as host of the nationally syndicated “The 100 Greatest Christmas Hits of All Time.” In 2021, he hosted syndicated program “The History of Rock ‘n’ Roll.” In 2017, Martindale appeared in a KFC ad campaign with actor Rob Lowe. He is survived by Sandy, his second wife of 49 years, and children Lisa, Madelyn ad Laura and numerous grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his son, Wink Jr. Martindale’s children are from his first marriage which ended in divorce in 1972.",Entertainment,1

Zimbabwe’s stone carvers seek a revival as an Oxford exhibition confronts a British colonial legacy,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2111,AP News,Farai Mustaka,20-04-25,"CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe (AP) — A pair of white hands blinding a Black face. A smiling colonizer with a Bible, crushing the skull of a screaming native with his boot. Chained men in gold mines, and a pregnant woman. These stone sculptures fromZimbabwewill take center stage at an upcoming exhibition at Oxford University in Britain, aiming to “contextualize” the legacy of British imperialist Cecil John Rhodes with depictions of religious deception, forced labor and sexual abuse. Rhodes conquered large parts of southern Africa in the late 19th century. He made a fortune in gold and diamond mining and grabbed land from the local population. Hisgrave lies under a slab of stone atop a hillin Zimbabwe. Oxford’s Oriel College, where the exhibition will be held in September, is a symbolic setting. A statue of Rhodes stands there despite protests against it since 2015. Rhodes, who died in 1902, was an Oriel student who left 100,000 pounds (now valued at about 10.5 million pounds, or $13.5 million) to the school. His influence endures through a scholarship for students from southern African countries. For Zimbabwean stone carvers at Chitungwiza Arts Center near the capital, Harare, the exhibition is more than an opportunity for Western audiences to glimpse a dark history. It is also a chance to revive an ancient but struggling art form. Stone sculpture, once a thriving local industry, has suffered due tovast economic challengesand declining tourism.  “This will boost business. Buyers abroad will now see our work and buy directly from the artists,” said sculptor Wallace Mkanka. His piece, depicting the blinded Black face, was selected as the best of 110 entries and will be one of four winning sculptures on display at Oxford. Zimbabwe, meaning “House of Stone,” derives its identity from the Great Zimbabwe ruins, a 1,800-acre Iron Age city built with precision-cut stones delicately stacked without mortar. It is a UNESCO World heritage site. The southern African countryhas long used stone sculpture as a form of storytellingto immortalize history. The craft survived close to a century of colonial rule that sought to erase local traditions, religion and art forms. It thrived internationally instead. Thousands of pieces were plundered from Africa. Some later became subjects of repatriation campaigns. Others became prized by tourists and collectors. A permanent collection of 20 Zimbabwean stone sculptures is displayed in a pedestrian tunnel at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the world’s busiest. At its peak following independence, Zimbabwe’s stone sculpture industry thrived, with local white farmers purchasing pieces for their homes and facilitating international sales. “Customers were everywhere. They would pay up front, and I always had a queue of clients,” recalled Tafadzwa Tandi, a 45-year-old sculptor whose work will feature in the Oxford exhibition. However, the industry has struggled over the past two decades. Zimbabwe’s global image suffered after controversial land reforms more than two decades ago displaced over 4,000 white farmers to redistribute land to about 300,000 Black families, according to government figures. Late ruler Robert Mugabedefended the reforms as necessary to address colonial-era inequities, but they had unintended economic consequences. “Many of our customers were friends of the farmers. That is where the problem originated from,” said Tendai Gwaravaza, chairman of Chitungwiza Arts Center. At the center, the sound of grinders filled the air as sculptors carved. Hundreds of finished pieces, ranging from small carvings to life-sized sculptures, waited for buyers. “The only solution now is to get out there to the markets ourselves. If we don’t, no one will,” Gwaravaza said. The Oxford exhibition represents such an opportunity for exposure, he said. It is the brainchild of the Oxford Zimbabwe Arts Partnership, formed in response to the “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign during theBlack Lives Matterprotests in the U.S. The group, consisting of Zimbabwean artists, an Oxford alumnus and a professor of African history, initially envisioned a larger project titled “Oxford and Rhodes: Past, Present, and Future.” It included enclosing Rhodes’ statue in glass, installing 100 life-size bronze statues of African liberation fighters and creating a collaborative sculpture using recycled materials to represent the future. However, the project required an estimated 200,000 pounds, far beyond available resources. Eventually, Oriel College provided 10,000 pounds for a scaled-down exhibition. “It’s still my hope that one day it could happen, but for now we have just accepted something very small to make a start and to do something,” said Richard Pantlin, the Oxford alumnus and OZAP co-founder. ___ For more on Africa and development:https://apnews.com/hub/africa-pulse ___ The Associated Press receives financial support for global health and development coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation.

Universal Epic Universe is the theme park resort’s biggest bang yet in Florida,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2112,AP News,Mike Schneider,19-04-25,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — From Harry Potter to Super Mario Bros. to Frankenstein’s monster, Universal Orlando Resort is pulling out all thepop culturestops at its newest and largesttheme park in Florida. With five distinctively-themed sections and a 500-room hotel, the multibillion-dollar Universal Epic Universe is slated to open to the public on May 22, just in time for the start of summer, when the Orlando area’s theme parks are usually jammed with families and young park-goers fresh out of school. It’s the first major, traditional theme park to open in Florida since 1999, when Universal Islands of Adventure debuted, though Universal opened a themed Orlando water park, Volcano Bay, in 2017. The addition of Epic Universe brings the total number of parks at the Florida resort to four, including Universal Studios. The opening also raises the stakes in Universal’s competition with crosstown rival Walt Disney World for a greater share of Orlando’s annual influx of 74 million tourists. Universal officials also describe Epic Universe as the company’s most technologically advanced theme park. For example, it uses a facial recognition system for ride express lines. Universal’s owner, Comcast NBCUniversal, also announced plans this month for itsfirst Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe, at a location north of London. A year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas should open later this year and a family-oriented theme park is slated to open next year in a Dallas suburb.  Epic Universe is making its big bang, with single-day tickets starting at $139 for adults and increasing to $199 during peak periods, just as the Trump administration stirs up economic uncertainty. U.S.tariff announcementsthreaten to limit the desire of some Americans to spend on vacations. And the rough treatment that someU.S. visitors have experiencedon arrival, as well asa boycott of the United Statesby some Canadians, are raising fears that international tourists will stay away. Tax receipts show Orlando’s tourist economy was booming last year, with Orange County collecting a record $359 million in tourist taxes. Here’s a look at Epic Universe’s different sections. Celestial Park is the hub in the spoke-like design of Epic Universe, connecting the other “worlds.” The astronomically-themed section is the only one with original characters not based on pre-existing intellectual property. Centered around a football field-sized water fountain and filled with abundant, colorful flowers, it’s an oasis of calm between the sensory overload of the four sections. That’s not to say excitement can’t be found in Celestial Park, which is home to a 133-foot (40.5-meter) high dual launching roller coaster, Stardust Racers, and an enormous carousel. Super Nintendo World is the definition of sensory overload, from its bright primary colors that scream “Look at me!” to the loudness of the steel-drum-thumping syncopated calypso music. It has two levels — rare for theme parks — and creates a completely immersive experience since nothing outside Super Nintendo World can be seen beyond the towering walls of Peach’s Castle and Mt. Beanpole. There is an augmented reality dark ride, a kid-friendly, slow-moving omni-mover ride and a Donkey Kong-themed coaster. Character performers dressed as Mario and Luigi greet members of the crowd in a roped-off area. Dark Universe is a throwback to Frankenstein’s monster, Dracula and the Invisible Man movies that launched Universal’s career in horror franchises. Visitors enter through a recreated central European village that has a storyline about vampires inhabiting the ground underneath. There is a dark ride through Frankenstein’s castle, a family-friendly coaster based on the werewolf legend and a tavern topped by a windmill with blades engulfed by flames every few minutes. This is the third installment of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions that turbocharged the Florida resort into a genuine challenger to Disney World’s dominance. The arched doorways, wrought-iron balconies and cobblestoned streets make visitors feel like they have parachuted into the Fantastic Beasts films set in 1920s Paris. The land’s highlight is the Battle at the Ministry’s omnidirectional lift ride, whose green-tiled, faux-gold-plated atrium is on a scale reminiscent of New York’s Grand Central Terminal. Next-generation animatronic dragons are the stars in this section, based on the “How to Train Your Dragon” franchise. Anchored by a lagoon at its center with Viking statues, the Viking-inspired land has a coaster, a boat ride and meet-and-greets with the surprisingly agile dragons, these aren’t your father’s animatronics. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky at@mikeysid.bsky.social.",Entertainment,1
Canadian drummer arrested on child sexual abuse material charges in California,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2113,AP News,Associated Press,19-04-25,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Joseph Seiders, drummer for Canadian indie rock band The New Pornographers, has been arrested and charged with possessing child sex abuse materials, authorities said. Seiders, 44, is accused of recording young boys with his phone at a Chick-fil-A restaurant bathroom in Palm Desert, California, according to the local sheriff’s department. The city of about 50,000 is in the Coachella Valley. Law enforcement responded to a report April 7 of suspicious activity at the fast food restaurant. An 11-year-old boy told them a man recorded him while he was using the bathroom there. Two days later, officers received another report at Chick-fil-A and took Seiders into custody. They searched his home and found evidence connecting him to the two incidents. His charges include possession of child sex abuse materials, molesting a child, and invasion of privacy, the sheriff’s department said. The Riverside County Public Defender’s Office declined to comment on Seiders’ behalf. Authorities believe there may be more victims and are still investigating. The New Pornographers said they have immediately severed ties with Seiders, who joined the band in 2014, in a post on Instagram. “Everyone in the band is absolutely shocked, horrified and devastated by the news of the charges against Joe Seiders,” the post said.",Entertainment,1
Judge denies Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ request to delay May 5 trial,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2114,AP News,Larry  Neumeister,18-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — The sex trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs will proceed as scheduled in early May despite his lawyer’s claims that they need an extra two months to prepare, a judge said Friday. Judge Arun Subramanian said at a Manhattan federal court hearing that the hip-hop mogul’s trial, projected to last from eight to 10 weeks, will start May 5. Lawyers for the entertainer had requested a two-month delay, citing a need for more time to gather information about trial witnesses and to cope with late additions to the indictment against their client. But the judge, noting that Combs has at least four attorneys, said the defense has sufficient time to be ready for trial next month. He said he would not grant a delay and allow a “fishing expedition” to seek more evidence. Combs, 55, who has been held without bail since his September arrest, turned toward the courtroom’s spectators after the hearing so he could face his mother. He gave a thumbs-up toward her and two other supporters, including a man who wore a “Free Puff” sweatshirt. He has pleaded not guilty. During Friday’s hearing, Subramanian made rulings about evidence and how the trial will proceed. Among his rulings, he said accusers who are called as witnesses by the government can testify under pseudonyms to protect their identities. He also refused a defense request to toss out several charges in the indictment returned against Combs.  Prosecutors say Combscoerced and abused womenfor two decades, using his“power and prestige”as a music star to silence victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings. They say the Bad Boy Records founder inducedfemale victimsinto drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances with male sex workers in events dubbed “Freak Offs.” Defense lawyers have said the government is mischaracterizing the relationship Combs had with former long-term girlfriends to criminalize consensual sexual conduct.",Entertainment,1
Judge won’t take further steps to enforce his order in AP case against Trump administration,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2115,AP News,David Bauder,18-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge whoordered the Trump administrationto stop blocking The Associated Press from presidential events refused Friday to take immediate steps to get White House officials to comply — an incremental development in a two-month dispute between the global news agency and administration officials over access. The case, which has significant free-speech implications under the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment, centers on the government blocking AP’s access to cover events because the outletwon’t rename the Gulf of Mexicoin its reports. U.S. District Judge Trevor N. McFadden, who handed the AP a victory last week in its efforts to end the ban, said it’s too soon to say that President Donald Trump is violating his order — as the AP suggests. “We are not at the point where we can make much of a determination one way or another,” said McFadden, ruling from the bench. “I don’t intend to micromanage the White House.” The AP’s lawyer, Charles Tobin, wouldn’t comment about the judge’s decision after the proceedings. The White House issued no immediate comment. The Associated Press logo is displayed at the news organization’s world headquarters in New York on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Aaron Jackson)   For two months, the White House has essentially banned AP reporters and photographers from their traditional spot covering events in smaller spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One. The AP says it’s a violation of its free-speech rights, enshrined in the First Amendment, to punish a news outlet for an editorial decision — an argument McFadden has endorsed. In response, the White House this weekissued a new press policythat occasionally lets the AP and other wire services into events it used to routinely cover at all times. Since McFadden’s ruling took effect, an AP photographer was allowed into the Oval Office on Thursday after three days of being blocked. A reporter has yet to be allowed back in, but the White House said an AP reporter will be part of the coverage rotation on Saturday — when reporters will follow Trump in a van to where he plans to play golf. In court, Tobin said the new policy is gamesmanship designed to diminish the outlet’s influence. “We think that the new policy really is a thumb in the nose at The Associated Press and this court,” he told McFadden. The White House took clear steps to put last week’s ruling into effect, said Jane Lyons, an assistant district attorney who was representing the Trump team. “It is way too soon ... to say that it is a problem,” Lyons said. McFadden said that the first few days since his order took effect gave him concerns that Trump’s team is “not proceeding in compliance here, or perhaps malicious compliance.” But the judge, appointed to the court by Trump during the president’s first term, said he has to assume that the administration is operating in good faith unless time proves otherwise. He also wasn’t swayed by the AP’s argument that it’s unconstitutional for the president to have sole discretion over who covers him at these smaller events. The AP, mindful that a dispute over journalists’ access isn’t likely to move many in the public, has cast it as a broader issue of freedom of speech. The AP’s decisions on what terminology to use are followed by journalists and other writers around the world through its influential stylebook. The outlet said it would continue to use Gulf of Mexico, as the body of water has been known for hundreds of years, while also noting Trump’s decision to rename it the Gulf of America. It’s an issue likely to take months to wend its way through the courts The APwent before a three-judge panelof the U.S. Court of Appeals Thursday on the same issue about compliance. The Trump administration has said that it will appeal McFadden’s initial ruling. ___ David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

A green comet likely is breaking apart and won’t be visible to the naked eye,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2116,AP News,Adithi Ramakrishnan,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — A newly discoveredgreen comettracked by telescopes has likely broken apart as it swung by the sun, dashing hopes of anaked-eye spectacle. Comet SWAN, hailing from the Oort Cloudbeyond Pluto, has been visible through telescopes and binoculars over the past few weeks with its streaming tail, but experts said it may not have survived its recenttrip past the sunand is fading fast. “We’ll soon be left with just a dusty rubble pile,” astrophysicist Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said in an email. Comets are balls of frozen gas and dust from billions of years ago. Every so often, a comet passes through the inner solar system. “These are relics from when the solar system first formed,” said Jason Ybarra, director of the West Virginia University Planetarium and Observatory. The newest comet was discovered by amateur astronomers, who spied it in photos taken by a camera on a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency to study the sun. The comet won’t swing close to Earth like Tsuchinshan-Atlas did last year. Other notable flybys includedNeowisein 2020 and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s. The comet, also designated C/2025 F2, would have been visible just after dark slightly north of where the sun set. Its green color would have been difficult to see with the naked eye. This might have been the object’s first ever trip past the sun, making it particularly vulnerable to breaking apart, Battams said. After its flyby, what’s left of the comet will disappear into the outer reaches of the solar system, past where scientists think it came from.  “It’s going to go so far out that we have no idea if it’s ever going to return,” said Battams. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASA’s Lucy spacecraft is speeding toward another close encounter with an asteroid,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2117,AP News,Marcia Dunn,18-04-25,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA’sLucy spacecraftwill swoop past a small asteroid this weekend as it makes its way to an even bigger prize: the unexploredswarms of asteroids out near Jupiter. It will be thesecond asteroid encounterfor Lucy, launched in 2021 on a quest that will take it to 11space rocks. The close approaches should help scientists better understand our early solar system when planets were forming; asteroids are theancient leftovers. The upcoming flyby is a dress rehearsal for 2027 when Lucy reaches its first so-called Trojan asteroid near Jupiter. Cranking up its three science instruments, the spacecraft on Sunday will observe the harmless asteroid known as Donaldjohanson. The encounter will take place 139 million miles (223 million kilometers) from Earth in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, so far away it will take 12 minutes for each bit of data to reach flight controllers in Colorado. The paleontologist for whom the asteroid is named plans to be at spacecraft builder and operator Lockheed Martin’s Mission Control for all the action. He discovered the fossil Lucy in Ethiopia 50 years ago; the spacecraft is named after the famous human ancestor. NASA’s Lucy will venture as close as 596 miles (960 kilometers) to this asteroid, an estimated 2 ½ miles (4 kilometers) in length but much shorter in width. Scientists should have a better idea of its size and shape following the brief visit. The spacecraft will zoom by at more than 30,000 mph (48,000 kph).  The asteroid is among countless fragments believed to have resulted from a major collision 150 million years ago. “It’s not going to be a basic potato. We already know that,” said lead scientist Hal Levison of Southwest Research Institute. Rather, Levison said the asteroid may resemble a bowling pin or even a snowman like Arrokoth, the Kuiper Belt object visited by NASA’s New Horizon spacecraft in 2019. The other possibility is that there are two elongated but separate asteroids far apart. “We don’t know what to expect. That’s what makes this so cool,” he said. There will be no communications with Lucy during the flyby as the spacecraft turns its antenna away from Earth in order to track the asteroid. Levison expects to have most of the science data within a day. Lucy’s next stop — “the main event,” as Levison calls it — will be the Trojan asteroids that share Jupiter’s orbit around the sun. Swarms of Trojans precede and follow the solar system’s largest planet as it circles the sun. Lucy will visit eight of them from 2027 through 2033, some of them in pairs of two. Lucy’s first asteroid flyby was in 2023 when it swept past little Dinkinesh, also in the main asteroid belt. The spacecraft discovered a mini moon around it. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

"How to catch the shooting stars of spring’s first meteor shower, the Lyrids",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2118,AP News,Christina Larson,18-04-25,"When theLyrid meteor showerreaches its peak, it will be spring’s first chance to seeshooting stars. The Lyrids have surprised skygazers in the past with as many as 100 meteors per hour, but it’s not predicted to be as active this time around. During Tuesday morning’s peak, expect to see around six meteors per hour, said Thaddeus LaCoursiere, planetarium program coordinator at the Bell Museum in St. Paul, Minnesota. The waning crescent moon will be 40% full, meaning a decent level of visibility under clear and dark conditions. Viewing lasts until April 26. Here’s what to know about the Lyrids and othermeteor showers. As the Earth orbits the sun, several times a year it passes through debris left by passing comets and sometimes asteroids. The source of the Lyrids is debris from the comet Thatcher. When these fast-moving space rocks enter Earth’s atmosphere, the debris encounters new resistance from the air and becomes very hot, eventually burning up. Sometimes the surrounding air glows briefly, leaving behind a fiery tail — the end of a “shooting star.” You don’t need special equipment to see the various meteor showers that flash across annually, just a spot away from city lights. The best time to watch a meteor shower is in the early predawn hours when the moon is low in the sky. Competing sources of light — such as a bright moon or artificial glow — are the main obstacles to a clear view of meteors. Cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest are optimal viewing opportunities. And keep looking up, not down. Your eyes will be better adapted to spot shooting stars if you aren’t checking your phone.  The next major meteor shower, the Eta Aquarids, peaks in early May. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

"Endangered sea turtle populations show signs of recovery in more than half the world, survey finds",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2119,AP News,Christina Larson,17-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Endangeredsea turtlesshow signs of recovery in a majority of places where they’re found worldwide, according to a new global survey released Thursday. “Many of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven’t,” said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. “Overall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.” The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development andclimate changeto the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found. But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species. Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado. Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal – with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.  Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found. “By ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well” in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle María Early Capistrán, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries. Sea turtles were protected under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973, and Mexico banned all captures of sea turtles in 1990. But it took a few decades for the results of these actions – alongside efforts to protect nesting beaches and reduce accidental bycatch in fishing – to show up in population trends, she said. Around the world, the problem of sea turtles dying after accidentally becoming entangled in fishing gear remains a major threat, said Wallace. New technologies are being developed to spare turtles, but they must be accepted and used regularly by diverse fishing communities to be effective, he added. The survey was published in the journal Endangered Species Research and is the first update in more than a decade. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A colossal squid is caught on camera for the first time in the deep sea,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2120,AP News,Christina Larson,16-04-25,"A colossal squid has been caught on camera for the first time in the deep sea by an international team of researchers steering a remotely operated submersible. The sighting was announced Tuesday by the Schmidt Ocean Institute. The squid filmed was a juvenile about 1 foot (30 centimeters) in length at a depth of 1,968 feet (600 meters) in the South Atlantic Ocean. Full-grown adult colossal squids, which scientists have uncovered from the bellies of whales and seabirds, can reach lengths up to 23 feet (7 meters) — almost the size of a small fire truck. The squid was spied last month near the South Sandwich Islands during an expedition to search for new sea life. Researchers waited to verify the species identification with other independent scientists before releasing the footage. “I really love that we have seen a young colossal squid first. This animal is so beautiful,” said Kat Bolstad, a squid researcher at the Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand, who helped confirm it. Researchers are testing different cameras in hopes of catching an adult colossal squid, Bolstad said. The young squid is almost entirely transparent, with thin arms. As adults, the squids lose this glassy appearance and become an opaque dark red or purple. When full grown, they are considered to be the world’s largest known invertebrates. ___ AP video journalist Mustakim Hasnath contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Where do whale sharks mate? The search to learn where the magic happens for the world’s biggest fish,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2121,AP News,Maria Cheng,19-04-25,"JAMESTOWN, St. Helena (AP) — Whale sharks shouldn’t be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous — they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers. But they somehowmanage to also be very private: Scientists don’t know where they mate, and they’ve never observed it before. They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters aroundSt. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean whereNapoleon Bonapartewas once exiled and died. It’s the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers — and food doesn’t seem to be the main attraction. Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he’s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and “displaying themselves” to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites. “What we’ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,” he said. “To this day we haven’t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.” Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.

(AP Photo/Flora Tomlinson-Pilley)    Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated asendangeredby the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been “largely depleted.” Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position. Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That’s not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present. Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water’s surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists. Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can’t withstand the pressure. “We have some very tantalizing and teasing video,” Perry said. “We have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.” Perry isn’t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. “It’s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.” Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he’s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was “the sharky equivalent of an erection.” “These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,” said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida. “This is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,” Dove said. Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers’ presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks’ mating practices. “Maybe they don’t want to be seen,” he said. “Maybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.” __ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

More pharmacies offer to speed prescription deliveries to customers,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2122,AP News,Tom Murphy,20-04-25,"America’s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep in as little as a few hours. Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They’re joininga trendthat has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible. Fast prescription delivery options are growing astraditional drugstores closeandmore people use telemedicineorsubscription-based carethat encourages regular deliveries. But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store. “It takes a lot to change people’s behavior when it comes to their health care,” said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester. Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association. CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023. Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours. Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix. Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It’s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds. Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well. “We’re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,” Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall. The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists. Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items. It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour. Customer demand drove Walmart’s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company. Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window. “This is just elevating that level of convenience,” he said. Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine. McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has “big plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.” Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more. Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly. People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp. “The practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,” he said. Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies. Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store. Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries “maybe 10 years from now when I’m not able to do it myself.” The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions. “Sometimes the wait can be a little long … that’s my only gripe,” he said. ___ Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

An Asian elephant calf was born at Zurich Zoo and its name will start with the letter Z,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2123,AP News,,20-04-25,"ZURICH (AP) — A 19-year-old Asian elephant at the Zurich Zoo gave birth this weekend to a male calf whose name, starting with the letter Z, will be announced this week. A light-sensitive monitoring camera picked up the birth before dawn Saturday and the baby’s earliest, wobbly steps inside the zoo’s Kaeng Krachan Elephant Park. It’s now home to six of the pachyderms: four females including mother Farha; bull elephant and father Thai; and the new calf. Zoo Director Severin Dressen said staff were happy but “still cautious” about the birth. “The first weeks of a calf’s life are always the most delicate — even if the calf currently appears healthy and fit,” he said in a statement. The Asian elephant, or Elephas maximus, is a critically endangered species with about 50,000 estimated in the wild, and their numbers are declining, the zoo said. The zoo breeds the elephants as part of conservation efforts under the European Endangered Species Program, Dressen said. Zoo staffers made sure to keep Farha — already a mother of three — away from another female named Panang, who has had little previous experience with young animals, and the separation will continue for the coming days. Such births are relatively rare in zoos compared to those of other species because of the elephant’s nearly two-year gestation period, zoo officials said. A zoo spokesman said the name of the new calf will be announced after a staff meeting on Wednesday, but 2025 is a “Z” year so the moniker will automatically start with that letter.",Science,1
Everglades restoration would protect Florida Keys while scientists watch drought conditions,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2124,AP News,David Fischer,20-04-25,"ISLAMORADA, Fla. (AP) — The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida’s east and west coasts. Florida Bay, a body of water located between the southern end of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys, makes up about a third of Everglades National Park. High salt levels during dry periods can have fatal consequences for the plants and animals living in the region, though experts are hopeful an early rain season this year will prevent a massive sea grass die-off like those experienced in the past. Steve Davis, chief science officer with The Everglades Foundation, called Florida Bay the estuary of the Everglades, which is actually a giant, slow-moving river starting around Orlando and running toward the southern end of the Florida peninsula. “What that meant for Florida Bay was that during wet years, there’s enough water getting into the bay to keep the salinities within that optimal salinity range,” Davis said. “But when we run into an average-to-dry year or a drought year, it meant that salinity levels in the bay would get so high that it could be detrimental to the health of the seagrasses and the other species that depend on that habitat.” Florida Bay doesn’t have particularly strong tides, meaning water can sit in the bay for up to a year. When evaporating seawater isn’t replaced by water from the Everglades, bay salinity levels can double normal ocean salinity, Davis explained. “And that’s when we really run into some problems with the health of the habitats down here in the bay,” he said.  The last major sea grass die-off occurred in 2015. Xavier Figueredo, a recreational boat captain with Bay and Reef Company, said he was working in the area when the massive die-off hit about 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares). “You can’t see the water. All you see is dead grass floating on top,” Figueredo said. “And it smells like sulfur, like rotting eggs. As the die-off continued, more of the ecosystem was affected, the fish were affected.” Even with more than 40% of Florida underdrought conditions, Davis said he is not especially worried yet about another sea-grass die-off. Salt levels in the bay are already comparatively lower this year than they were in 2015. Davis said that is at least partially thanks to a massive project that elevated more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) of the Tamiami Trail, a roadway built in 1928 that runs through the Everglades from Miami to Naples before heading north to Tampa. The route was essentially a giant dam preventing water from flowing south, but replacing the roadway with two long bridges, completed in 2013 and 2019, unblocked the so-called river of grass. “Months of inflow across Tamiami Trail have helped to moderate salinities,” Davis said. The other significant advantage Florida Bay has this year compared to 2015 is the forecast of an early wet season rather than a delayed wet season, Davis said. While elevating Tamiami Trail already has created significant benefit for the Everglades and Florida Bay, scientists are counting on a massive restoration project, theEverglades Agricultural Area Reservoir, to address decades-old water problems throughout Florida. The $3.9 billion project will create a reservoir and wetland to store and clean polluted water from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida before it’s discharged into the southern Everglades. This also should decrease the amount of polluted water being sent to Florida’s east and west coasts. Davis called the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir “the game changer for freshwater flow restoration.” “What we’re seeing right now are just the benefits of the plumbing, the infrastructure that helps to get all that water into the park,” he said. “But once we’re able to flow those larger volumes of water south, we’re going to see system-wide improvement all the way down into Florida Bay.” Everglades restoration is not only tied to Florida’s ecological future but its economic future, said Paul Hindsley, the Everglades Foundation chief economist. “For every dollar of investment in restoration, we’re receiving $4 in economic benefits,” Hindsley said. Economic benefits include adding to the residential and industrial water supply, reducing extreme events from drought such as fires and reducing the risk of flooding from heavy precipitation, Hindsley said. The Everglades also provide over $5 billion a year in reduced risk for costs associated with National Flood Insurance Program claims. Meanwhile, South Florida’s mangroves and reefs play an important role in reducing the impacts of storm surge. “Protecting the environment is protecting the wealth of Floridians,” Hindsley said.",Science,1
A Soyuz capsule with 2 Russians and 1 American returns to Earth from the International Space Station,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2125,AP News,,20-04-25,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Soyuz capsule carrying two Russians and one American from the International Space Station landed Sunday in Kazakhstan, ending their seven-month research assignment.

Scientists find possible chemical signs of life on a faraway planet,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2126,AP News,Danica Kirka,18-04-25,"LONDON (AP) — Astronomers have found possible chemical signs of life on a distant planet outside our solar system, though they caution more work is needed to confirm their findings. The research, led by scientists at the University of Cambridge, detected evidence of compounds in the exoplanet’s atmosphere that on Earth are only produced by living organisms and contended it’s the strongest potential signal yet of life. Independent scientists described the findings as interesting, but not nearly enough to show the existence of life on another planet. “It is the strongest sign to date of any possibility of biological activity outside the solar system,” Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan said during a livestream on Thursday. By analyzing data from the James Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles. On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton. The planet is more than double Earth’s size and more than 8 times more massive. It’s in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters. Madhusudhan stressed that further research is needed to rule out any errors or the possibility of other processes, besides living organisms, that could produce the compounds.  David Clements, an astrophysicist at Imperial College London, said atmospheres on other planets are complex and difficult to understand, especially with the limited information available from a planet so far away. “This is really interesting stuff and, while it does not yet represent a clear detection of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, it is a step in the right direction,” he said in comments released by the Science Media Center in London. More than 5,500 planets orbiting other stars have been confirmed so far. Thousands more are in the running out of the billions out there in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Launched in 2021, Webb is the biggest and most powerful observatory ever sent into space.",Science,1
"Tatooine-like planet outside the solar system may orbit two failed stars, scientists say",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2127,AP News,Adithi Ramakrishnan,16-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — A newTatooine-likeplanet outside the solar system may orbit twofailed stars, scientists reported Wednesday. Located about 120 light years away, the exoplanet appears to take an unusual path around two brown dwarfs, whipping around at a right angle. Brown dwarfs are sometimes called failed stars because they’re lighter than stars, but heavier than gas giant planets. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles. The brown dwarf pair was first spotted years ago. Scientists noticed that the twins eclipse each other so one is always partly blocked when seen from Earth. In a new analysis, researchers found that the brown dwarfs’ motion was changing — a quirk that’s less likely to happen if they circled each other on their own. The research was published in the journal Science Advances. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports a planet similar to one in the “Star Wars” movie may have been discovered. Scientists know of over a dozen planets that orbit two stars like the fictional “Star Wars” scorching desert planet Tatooine with double sunsets that Luke Skywalker calls home. The new planet’s odd orbit sets it apart. But it hasn’t been directly spied, and scientists say more research is needed to be sure it’s out there and figure out its mass and orbit. “I wouldn’t bet my life that the planet exists yet,” said Simon Albrecht, an astrophysicist with Aarhus University who had no role in the new study. Probing these wacky celestial bodies can help us understand how conditions beyond our solar system may yield planets vastly different from our own, said study author Thomas Baycroft with the University of Birmingham.  Planets circling twin stars “existed in sci-fi for decades before we knew that they could even really exist in reality,” he said. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A strong solar storm heads to Earth. Here’s what to know about northern lights,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2128,AP News,Adithi Ramakrishnan,15-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — A strong solar storm headed to Earth could producecolorful aurora displaysacross more U.S. states than usual Tuesday night. The sunearlier this week burped out huge bursts of energy called coronal mass ejections, leading space weather forecasters to issue a geomagnetic storm watch. Northern lightswere forecast in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. Parts of northern Idaho, Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, New York and Pennsylvania may also get a view. The strength of the light show will depend on how Earth’s magnetic field interacts with the solar bursts, said Shawn Dahl at NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center. Here’s what to know about auroras and how to spot them. The sun is at the maximum phase of its11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come. “This is going to kind of continue off and on throughout the year,” Dahl said. Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth,producing light displaysacross the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.  Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth’s atmosphere. Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way. Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications. The sun’s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won’t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth. When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth’s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam. Space weather experts aren’t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth. Northern lights forecasts can be found onNOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center websiteor an aurora forecasting app. Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. NASA’s Kelly Korreck recommended skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely. Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren’t visible to the naked eye. “Enjoy it,” said Korreck. “It’s this great show ... from the sun to you.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A mass grave for fighters in a Roman Empire-era battle is revealed in Vienna,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2129,AP News,Philipp Jenne,3-04-25,"VIENNA (AP) — As construction crews churned up dirt to renovate a Vienna soccer field last October, they happened upon an unprecedented find: A heap of intertwined skeletal remains in a mass grave dating to the 1st-century Roman Empire, likely the bodies of warriors in a battle involving Germanic tribes. On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave — linked to “a catastrophic event in a military context” and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region. The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 — a discovery never seen before in Central Europe. “Within the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,” said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. “There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.” Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century. The pit where the bodies were deposited suggests a hasty or disorganized dumping of corpses. Every skeleton examined showed signs of injury — to the head, torso and pelvis in particular. “They have various different battle wounds, which rules out execution. It is truly a battlefield,” said Kristina Adler-Wölfl, head of Vienna city archaeological department. “There are wounds from swords, lances; wounds from blunt trauma.”  The victims were all male. Most were aged 20 to 30 years old and generally showed signs of good dental health. Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave – armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae. The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second. The research continues: Only one victim has been confirmed as a Roman warrior. Archaeologists hope DNA and strontium isotope analysis will help further identify the fighters, and whose side they were on. “The most likely theory at the moment is that this is connected to the Danube campaigns of Emperor Domitian — that’s 86 to 96 A.D.,” Adler-Wölfl said. City archaeologists said the discovery also reveals the early signs of the founding of a settlement that would become the Austrian capital of today. ___ Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed.",Science,1
Archaeologists uncover the oldest known partial face fossil of a human ancestor in western Europe,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2130,AP News,Christina Larson,12-03-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A fossil of a partial face from ahuman ancestoris the oldest in western Europe, archaeologists reported Wednesday. The incomplete skull — a section of the left cheek bone and upper jaw – was found in northern Spain in 2022. The fossil is between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old, according to researchpublished in the journal Nature. “The fossil is exciting,” said Eric Delson, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the study. “It’s the first time we have significant remains older than 1 million years old in western Europe.” The fossil of the left midface of a hominin between 1.1 million and 1.4 million years old recovered from the Sima del Elefante site in Sierra de Atapuerca, Burgos, Spain. (Maria D. Guillén/IPHES-CERCA via AP)  A collection of older fossils from early human ancestors waspreviously found in Georgia, near the crossroads of eastern Europe and Asia. Those are estimated to be 1.8 million years old. The Spanish fossil is the first evidence that clearly shows human ancestors “were taking excursions into Europe” at that time, said Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian’s Human Origins Program. But there is not yet evidence that the earliest arrivals persisted there long, he said. “They may get to a new location and then die out,” said Potts, who had no role in the study. The partial skull bears many similarities to Homo erectus, but there are also some anatomical differences, said study co-author Rosa Huguet, an archaeologist at the Catalan Institute of Human Paleoecology and Social Evolution in Tarragona, Spain.

Guillén/IPHES-CERCA via AP)  Homo erectus arose around 2 million years ago and moved from Africa to regions of Asia and Europe, with the last individuals dying out around 100,000 years ago, said Potts. It can be challenging to identify which group of early humans a fossil find belongs to if there’s only a single fragment versus many bones that show a range of features, said University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer, who was not involved in the study. The same cave complex in Spain’s Atapuerca Mountains where the new fossil was found also previously yielded other significant clues to the ancient human past.

The torso of a Buddha statue has been found at Cambodia’s Angkor temple complex,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2131,AP News,Sopheng Cheang,13-03-25,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Archaeologistsin Cambodiaare celebrating an unexpected find at the country’s centuries-old Angkor temple complex: the torso of a statue of Buddha that matches a head found nearly a century ago at the same site. The torso, believed to be from the 12th or 13th century, was discovered during a dig by a team of Cambodian and Indian experts last month at Angkor’s Ta Prohm temple. It was found along with 29 fragments that appeared to be part of the same statue, archaeologist Neth Simon said this week. It stands at 1.16 meters (3 3/4 feet) tall and is in the Bayon art style, associated with Angkor’s Bayon temple. “It was a big surprise when we unearthed this sculpture because all we’d found so far were small pieces,” Neth Simon told The Associated Press by phone from Siem Reap province. She described the statue’s design as displaying carved jewelry and robe and sash, with a unique left-hand gesture across the chest — “an uncommon representation in Khmer (Cambodian) art.” This February 2025 image provided by the Apsara National Authority, shows a headless statue excavated by archaeologists at the Angkor temple complex in Cambodia’s Siem Reap province. According to archaeologists, the head of the same statue was dug up in 1927 and is now in Cambodia’s National museum in the capital Phnom Penh, and the two parts may be reattached for display. (Apsara National Authority via AP)  The statue’s presumed head was discovered at the same temple in 1927 during the French colonial era, and is currently kept at Cambodia’s main National Museum in the capital Phnom Penh. Neth Simon said the torso was found about 50 meters (yards) away from the site where the head was discovered, and that an optical electronic scan confirmed they were a match. A near-complete reconstruction of the status is possible, Neth Simon added, now that only the right hand of the statue remains missing. Her team will ask the Minister of Culture and Fine Art for approval to reattach the head and body of the sculpture to make it whole for public display.  The Angkor site sprawls across some 400 square kilometers (155 square miles), containing the ruins of capitals of various Cambodian empires from the 9th to the 15th centuries. Scholars consider it to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia. The site is Cambodia’s mostpopular tourist attractionand in 2024 attracted about a million international tourists, according to Cambodia’s Tourism Ministry. The excavations aim to organize and preserve thenumerous art objectsscattered throughout the Ta Prohm complex, highlighting the ongoing efforts to protect and understand Cambodia’s rich cultural heritage, the Apsara Authority says. Neth Simon said she would be delighted if the statue’s pieces could be reassembled after being far apart from each other for a century. “As an archaeologist, I would be really happy,” she said.

"The Asian elephant population in Cambodia is more robust than previously thought, a study finds",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2133,AP News,David Rising,14-03-25,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — A genetic study of Asian elephants in northern Cambodia published Thursday reveals a larger and more robust population than previously thought, raising hopes the endangered species could slowly recover. Researchers from the Fauna & Flora conservation group collected samples from elephant dung in Cambodia’s northern plains and extracted DNA. From the DNA they were able to identify individual elephants, estimate population size, and determine the sex of the animals and the overall genetic diversity of the population. From their work they estimated that there are 51 elephants in the Prey Lang, Preah Roka, and Chhaeb Wildlife Sanctuaries, with greater genetic diversity — a “critical factor for long-term viability,” the researchers said — than in two other areas of the country in which they live. “With sufficient suitable habitat remaining in the region, the population has the potential to grow if properly protected,” the report concludes. Overall, some 400 to 600 Asian elephants are believed to remainliving in the wildin Cambodia. Researchers said the study’s findings underscore the potential of the northern area studied to become a “national stronghold” for them, contributing to Cambodia’s biodiversity conservation goals. “Habitat degradation, especially when it leads to fragmentation, continues to be a serious concern,” Pablo Sinovas, director of Fauna & Flora in Cambodia, told The Associated Press.  “This study provides a robust basis on which to base conservation efforts and landscape management.” The study, supported by USAID funds and Britain’s People’s Postcode Lottery, was conducted in collaboration with the Cambodian Environment Ministry. The genetic testing was done at the Royal University of Phnom Penh with technical support from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The research was carried out in the 2020-21 dry season, but Sinovas said since elephants reproduce slowly it is not thought that the population size would have changed significantly since then. Researchers want to replicate the study elsewhere in Cambodia and in other countries, such as neighboring Vietnam where the Asian elephants live in fragmented populations. “We were very pleasantly surprised by the results of the project,” said Alex Ball, conservation manager for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. “We now hope to expand this methodology across Cambodia and beyond, helping to build a clearer picture of Asian elephant numbers, which will inform how best we can work to help reverse the decline of these spectacular animals.” ____ Rising reported from Bangkok",Science,1
"30 years after discovery of remains, DNA could identify all of a serial killer’s victims",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2134,AP News,Rick Callahan,7-01-25,"WESTFIELD, Ind. (AP) — Decades after investigators unearthed thousands of human bones and bone fragments on a suspected Indiana serial killer’s property, a renewed quest is playing out in laboratories to solve a long-running mystery: Who were they? Anew teamworking to identify the unknown dead says the key to their success will be getting relatives of men who vanished between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s to provide samples of their own DNA. Those samples can then be screened againstDNA profilesscientists are extracting from the remains, which were found starting in 1996 on Herbert Baumeister’s sprawling suburban Indianapolis property.

(AP Photo/Darron Cummings)  The original investigators believed that at least 25 people were buried at Baumeister’s 18-acre (7.3-hectare) Fox Hollow Farm estate in Westfield, based on evidence that included 10,000 bones and bone fragments, as well as handcuffs and shotgun shells. Baumeister, a 49-year-old thrift store owner and married father of three, killed himself in Canada in July 1996 before police could question him, taking with him many secrets, including the names of his presumed victims. Investigators believed that while his family was away on trips, Baumeister, who frequented gay bars in Indianapolis, lured men to his home, where he killed and buried them. By the late 1990s, authorities had identified eight men using dental records and available DNA technologies. But then those efforts stopped, although the remains of at least 17 people may have still been unidentified.  Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison stands in his office in Noblesville, Indiana, July 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Rick Callahan)  Hamilton County Coroner Jeff Jellison said the renewed identification effort revealed that county officials at the time decided not to fund additional DNA testing, which “essentially halted further efforts to identify the victims and placed the cost of a homicide investigation on family members of missing people.” “I can’t speak for those investigators, but it was just game over,” Jellison said. As decades slipped by, the bones and fragments sat in boxes at the University of Indianapolis’ Human Identification Center, whose staff helped excavate the remains. That changed after Eric Pranger sent Jellison a Facebook message in late 2022. The Indianapolis man’s family had long believed his older cousin, Allen Livingston, was among Baumeister’s victims. Livingston was 27 when he vanished in August 1993 after getting into someone else’s car in downtown Indianapolis. After hearing about Baumeister three years later, his mother, Sharon Livingston, and other relatives began suspecting that Allen, who was bisexual, was among the dead. Jellison was about to take office when Pranger asked if he could help get some answers for his aunt, who had serious health problems. “How do you say to no to that? That’s our job as coroners by statute, to identify the deceased,” Jellison said. In late 2022, police took DNA samples from Sharon Livingston and one of her daughters. Jellison began working with a team that includes the Indiana State Police, the FBI, the Human Identification Center, local law enforcement and a private company that specializes inforensic genetic genealogy. Staff at the Human Identification Center, where the remains are stored in a temperature- and humidity-controlled space, selected some of the most promising bones for DNA analysis.

(AP Photo/Rick Callahan)  At the Indiana State Police Laboratory, scientists cut out sections of bone, froze them with liquid nitrogen and pulverized them into a fine powder. They then used heat and chemicals to break open bone cells in the first step toward extracting a full DNA profile. Nearly a year after hearing from Pranger, Jellison announced in October 2023 thata ninth Baumeister victimhad been identified: Allen Livingston. Sharon Livingston finally received some form of closure. She died in November 2024. “It made me happy to be able to do this for my aunt,” Pranger, 34, said. “I’m the one who got the ball rolling to bring her son home after 30 years and I felt privileged.” “After Allen was identified I was so excited and then after the fact I asked myself, `Now what? I got answers, but what about all the other families?’” Pranger added. Jellison said about 40 DNA samples have been submitted by people who believe a missing male relative may have been killed by Baumeister. He said those are entered into the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System,or CODIS, but are usedsolely for identifying missing people. The coroner and his partners hope to get more DNA samples from relatives of men from across the U.S. who vanished between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. They noted the men may have been traveling and stopped in Indianapolis to visit friends or sample its nightlife.

(AP Photo/Rick Callahan)  To date, scientists have extracted eight unique DNA profiles — all male — from more than 70 of the 100 bones that were sent to the Indiana State Police Laboratory by Dr. Krista Latham, the Human Identification Center’s director. One matched DNA samples provided by Livingston’s mother and sister. Four matched four of the eight men first identified in the 1990s: Jeffrey Jones,Manuel Resendez,Johnny Bayer and Richard Hamilton. The three other DNA profiles remain unidentified and two are still undergoing testing. Those three have boosted Baumeister’s presumed victims to 12. Jellison and his partners say their identification effort could take several more years to complete.

(AP Photo/Rick Callahan)  Most of the bones were crushed and burned, reducing their potential to yield usable DNA. Latham, a professor of biology and anthropology, said bone fragments deemed in poor shape are being held back from the destructive testing process in hope thatfuture DNA technologiescan unlock their secrets. She noted some of the men may have been estranged from relatives or ostracized because of their sexuality. No one may have noticed when they vanished. “These are individuals who were marginalized in life. And we just need to make sure that that’s not continuing in death as well,” Latham said. For the ongoing work, Jellison has obtained DNA reference samples from relatives of seven of the eight men originally identified in the 1990s. The eighth man, Steven Hale, was adopted and efforts to locate biological relatives have thus far failed, the coroner said. Relatives of missing men who want to provide family DNA reference samples for the effort to identify remains can contact the Indiana State Police missing persons hotline at 833-466-2653 or the Hamilton County Coroner’s Office at 317-770-4415. As remains are identified, piece by piece, families can opt to have them cremated and interred at a memorial dedicated in August in Westfield. It includes a plaque with the names of the nine identified victims, with room for more names. Linda Znachko, whose nonprofit Indianapolis-based ministryHe Knows Your Name, paid for the monument, said at the memorial’s dedication that the identification campaign “will bring honor to those who lost their lives at the Fox Hollow tragedy.” Remains belonging to Livingston and Jeffrey Jones were added to the memorial’s ossuary and white doves were released during the dedication.

The Day of the Dead in Mexico is a celebration for the 5 senses,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2135,AP News,María Verza,1-11-23,"MEXICO CITY (AP) — TheDay of the Dead in Mexicosmells like cempasuchil flowers and copal incense. It has a sweet taste. Sounds and colors abound. There are photos, candles and music all over. The hands of artisans prepare the altars to honor their ancestors. Although it is an intangible tradition, borne down from pre-Hispanic cultures, Day of the Dead is also a celebration for all the senses —even if one of them is failing you. Gerardo Ramírez, who over the years become almost blind, sums it all up in one line: “You honor people, you connect with the past.” Together, two smells show dead souls the way out of the underworld: cempasúchil — a type of marigold whose name means “flower of 20 petals in Náhuatl language” — and a tree resin called copal burned at altars. The native species of cempasúchil smells so strong you can almost hear it, said Verenice Arenazas, a young woman who traded her HR job for her family’s traditional flower field. “As soon as you move it, it tells you ‘here I am, look at me’” she said. Her family this year produced 17,000 cempasúchil plants in Xochimilco, Mexico City’s famed canal-crossed southern borough. Arenazas’ family grows two types of cempasúchil: those grown by selecting seeds from the most potent-smelling flowers and those that are genetically modified. Both are nearly sold out, she said with a smile.  A catrina sculpture in the likeness of Mexican revolutionary Hero Pancho Villa stands at the Zocalo, Mexico City´s main square, during celebrations ahead of the Day of the Dead on Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)  Arenazas says the flowers smell like the “sweet, fresh, honest work” of the farmers like her who dedicate unending days caring for the flowers. They also smell of “Mexican pride,” she said. On the traditional altars honoring the dead, food is a symbol of Mother Earth. Even the sweetest bread, flavored with orange blossom, has grizzly origins. According to researchers at the Mexican School of Gastronomy, the dough was prepared by mixing honey and human blood as an offering to the gods. Other historians believe that Spanish colonizers, frightened by human sacrifices in Mexico, created a bread, dipped in sugar and painted it red, to symbolize a heart. Visitors with faces painted as catrinas pose for photos at Mexico City´s main square the Zocalo, ahead of the Day of the Dead celebrations, Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)  Today there is a special place on altars for the dead person’s favorite food and drink. “The offering loses flavor,” explained Ramírez, “because the dead actually come back; what they eat is the essence.” Ramírez explained the communion between the living and the dead recalling an anecdote that marked him when he was a child. When his uncle died, the family placed his body on the dining table until the coffin arrived. Then they all sat down to eat there. Preparing an altar is a great pleasure to many Mexicans. “To feel the softness of the flowers, where you put the food, all the textures,” said Ramírez. “It’s an explosion of sensations.” Altars welcome all sorts of handicrafts, from papier-mache skeletons toalebrijes (imaginary animal figures),but“papel picado” - very thin sheets of colored paper cut-outs - is essential. There are places where “papel picado” is still made with hammer and chisel, as in the workshop of Yuriria Torres, located south of Mexico City. “It’s like sculpting” a work of art, says Torres, who still does the whole process by hand, eschewing stencils or laser cutters. People pose for photos next to a Day of the Dead-themed presentation at Mexico City´s main square the Zocalo, on Tuesday, Oct. 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Marco Ugarte)  Some people connect Torres’ art to the sheets of amate tree bark used by pre-Hispanic communities as paper, though the Indigenous precursor was not dyed. Others say the careful cuttings originated in China, and were brought to Mexico by the Spaniards. Either way, researchers agree that it symbolizes the union between life and death. Perhaps for that reason, the scenes that Torres represents are skulls or skeletons dancing or eating. While some older Mexicans remember hearing only the murmur of prayers characterizing the Day of the Dead, today mariachi music can be heard over the decorated tombs of many cemeteries. José García, a 60-year-old shoe shiner from San Antonio Pueblo Nuevo, a township 90 miles (140 kilometers) west of Mexico City, said people with money would bring a group of musicians to the cemetery to toast with their departed loved ones and listen to their favorite songs. But, he adds, one doesn’t have to have money to enjoy the music. Some people just bring “their recordings or their horns,” he said. Day of the Dead is one of Mexico’s great visual spectacles — and a celebration of cultural syncretism. All the while, its fundamental purpose is to remember those who have died so their souls don’t disappear forever. Photos of the departed loved ones take the most important spot on the altar. Colors fill everything. The bright orange of the cempasúchil, the black of the underworld, the purple of the Catholic faith, red for warriors and white for children. Remembrance is not only individual, but collective. Some more political altars in the country’s main public university, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, remembered murdered students and the Palestinian dead in the Israel-Hamas war. Elsewhere remembrance is institutional, like the offering in the capital’s Zócalo in honor of the revolutionary Pancho Villa on the centenary of his death. Beyond the visual spectacle, the important thing is to “get into” the offering, to connect with the past and go beyond the senses, insists Ramírez. “It’s not something they explain to you,” he says. “From the moment you are born and experience the celebration, it’s in your DNA.” ____ Follow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean athttps://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",Science,1
"If it seems like there are a lot of acorns this fall, you might be seeing a ‘mast’ year",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2136,AP News,Jessica Damiano,31-10-23,"Has your car been getting pelted with acorns? Have you found yourself running through a hailstorm of walnuts with your hands protecting your head? Chances are the trees in your region are experiencing a mast year. Nut-bearing trees, like black walnuts, beeches and those acorn-producing oaks, have “on” and “off” years. “On” years, called mast years, see vigorous production of nuts across an entire species throughout a region. During mast years, a single oak can drop thousands of acorns, forcing you to rake your lawn even before any leaves drop, or sweep your driveway to avoid twisting your ankle while navigating a blanket of marbles. After expending all that energy on an abundant crop, the trees take a break, producing few if any nuts during “off” years. The cycles for mature red oaks and black walnuts typically run two to five years; pecans tend to alternate between boom and bust, often taking just one year off. Most fruit and nut trees undergo these cycles, although each species has its own timeline. And even then, their schedules are not set in stone. “There’s no general consensus (among scientists) on why we see these mast years,” according to Jonathan M. Lehrer, associate professor and chair of the Department of Urban Horticulture and Design at Farmingdale State College in New York. “There’s a lot of conjecture that it’s caused by variations in temperature and natural rainfall, but we’ve never been able to hammer out exactly why some years have greater production than others.” Mast years help to ensure the propagation of a tree species because at least some of those acorns and nuts, which contain seeds, take root and grow into saplings. The phenomenon also affects the wildlife population, as bumper crops during mast years provide abundant food for woodpeckers, deer, mice, wild turkeys, squirrels and other animals, resulting in more breeding. Less food during off years tends to keep those populations in check. “The production of trees has far-reaching consequences on wildlife and other organisms, and fewer rodents (during off years) affects larger animals higher on the food chain, like foxes, owls and bobcats,” Lehrer said. “Although an abundance of acorns may be a nuisance, the ecological consequences of a mast year can extend for a year or two or three afterward.” The reasons and stimuli for the cycles may be unknown, but one thing is clear: “As plants go, we go,“ Lehrer said. So, if you’re finding yourself ducking for cover, take precautions: Avoid parking under masting trees to protect your car. Take care when walking so as not to slip or trip.

Vultures are among the least loved animals. African conservationists are trying to change that,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2137,AP News,Gerald Imray,12-04-25,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Vultures have an image problem. Seen as ugly and associated with death, they are among the least loved animals in the world. But conservationists in Africa are trying to change that. They’ve launched an effort tosave endangered vulturesby trying to put a dollar figure on their incredible value. A recent report by the BirdLife International conservation organization estimated that vultures are worth $1.8 billion a year to certain ecosystems in southern Africa, which might surprise anyone not familiar with the clean-up, pest control and anti-poaching work performed by one of the most efficient scavengers on the planet. “They are not up there on the pretty scale. And they are not popular. But we know they are very useful,” said Fadzai Matsvimbo, an extinction prevention coordinator at BirdLife International. The report comes at an important time for Africa’s vultures; six of the 11 species found on the continent are listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which says vultures arehighly threatened in many parts of the world. In Africa, some species have declined by nearly 90%, Matsvimbo said. Conservationists hope the report will make authorities and the publicmore aware of the positive impactof vultures. It focused on research in Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe and shows how a wake of vultures — the term for a group of feeding vultures — can strip a decomposing carcass in hours, cleaning up ecosystems, reducing the chance of disease spreading and the presence of pests like rats and feral dogs, which has great benefits to communities.  Vultures also have extremely strong stomach acid, don’t get food poisoning and are able to consume and neutralize anthrax, botulism and other bacteria and toxins in carcasses that would kill other animals, removing deadly threats from the environment. Just this week, more than 50 hippos died from suspected anthrax poisoning in a reserve in Congo. Vultures are nature’s “best sanitation services,” said Matsvimbo. Conservationists have raised the case of the drastic loss of vultures in India over the last 30 years and how that led to a health crisis. A study published last year said half a million people died in India because of the spread of bacteria and infections in the absence of vultures. Matsvimbo said vultures in Africa are also used as “sentinels” by game rangers because they are often the first to spot a dead animal and can lead rangers to where poachers might be active. They have even proven useful in helping farmers locate dead or injured livestock. Vultures are uniqueamong land vertebrates in that they only feed on carrion — dead animals. That makes them especially susceptible to poisoning by humans, either intentionally by poachers and others who want to get rid of them, or by mistake when pests are the target. Hundreds of vultures can die from a single poisoned carcass. Vultures are also regularly killed or maimed in collisions with powerlines in Africa. And they are increasingly being killed for belief-based reasons, said Kerri Wolter, the CEO of the Vulpro vulture rehabilitation center in South Africa, which treats sick and injured vultures to be released back into the wild. She said because vultures have such outstanding eyesight and instincts when it comes to finding a dead animal they are viewed by some as being clairvoyant and able to foresee death. Their body parts, and especially their head, are used in potions or as charms to predict the future. “Our work is to change the mindsets of people,” Wolter said. “For them to see vultures and think, wow that is amazing.” Matsvimbo and Wolter both said vultures have been given a raw deal by moviemakers in Hollywood, where they are almost always shown as evil and sinister. Movies have done for vultures what “Jaws” did for sharks, Wolter said. “I love watching ‘The Lion King,’ but every time they do the vulture part, my heart breaks,” said Matsvimbo. “Vultures are never portrayed in a positive way. I have a bone to chew with these moviemakers. Or should that be bone to pick?” ___ AP Africa news:https://apnews.com/hub/africa",Science,1

An executive order he signed Wednesdaycalls for an immediate end to water conservation standardsthat restrict the number of gallons per minute that flow through showerheads and other appliances such as dishwashers, washing machines and toilets. “I like to take a nice shower, take care of my beautiful hair,” Trump said Wednesday as he signed an executive order at the White House. “I have to stand in the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. Comes out drip, drip, drip. It’s ridiculous.” “What you do is you end up washing your hands five times longer, so it’s the same water,’' he added. “And we’re going to open it up so that people can live.” The order directs Energy Secretary Chris Wright to immediately rescind what Trump called the “overly complicated federal rule” that redefined the word showerhead under the last two Democratic presidents. Biden and former President Barack Obama both imposed restrictions on water flow from showerheads and other appliances. The standards were intended to make dishwashers, showerheads, refrigerators, laundry machines and toilets use less energy and water.  But the regulations “turned a basic household item into a bureaucratic nightmare,’' the White House said in a fact sheet. “No longer will showerheads be weak and worthless.” The Appliance Standards Awareness Project, which advocates for energy efficiency, said the Biden-era standards cut utility bills and protect the environment. Showers account for about 20% of the average American family’s daily indoor water use, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Water-saving showerheads also save energy, since heating water accounts for about a fifth of the average home’s energy use. Andrew deLaski, executive director of ASAP, said consumer reviews consistently show that most showerheads currently sold “provide a great drenching. So there isn’t a problem to be solved here with the showerheads available today.” He called Trump’s order a gimmick designed to get around a 1992 energy efficiency law, and he predicted a similar result to Trump’s actions during his first term, when no major showerhead manufacturer made significant changes to their products.",Science,1
Judge blocks imports of some Chilean sea bass from Antarctica in fishing feud at bottom of the world,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2139,AP News,Joshua Goodman,31-03-25,"MIAMI (AP) — A federal judge in Florida has blocked the imports of a high-priced fish from protected waters near Antarctica, siding with U.S. regulators who argued they were required to block imports amid a diplomatic feud triggered by Russia’s obstruction of longstanding conservation efforts at the bottom of the world. Judge David Leibowitz, in a ruling Monday, dismissed alawsuit filed in 2022by Texas-based Southern Cross Seafoods that alleged it had suffered undue economic harm by what it argued was the U.S. government’s arbitrary decision to bar imports of Chilean sea bass. The case, closely watched by conservation groups and the fishing industry, stems fromRussia’s rejection of catch limitsfor marine life near the South Pole. Every year for four decades, 26 governments banded together in the Commission on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, to set catch limits for Patagonia toothfish, as Chilean sea bass is also known, based on the recommendations of a committee of international scientists. But in 2021, and ever since, Russian representatives to the treaty organization have refused to sign off on the catch limits in what many see as a part of a broader push by President Vladimir Putin’s government to stymie international cooperation on a range of issues. Russia’s refusal was an effective veto because the commission works by consensus, meaning any single government can hold up action. The U.K.’s response to Russia’s gambit was to unilaterally set its own catch limit for Chilean sea bass — lower than the never-adopted recommendation of the scientific commission — and issue its own licenses to fish off the coast of South Georgia, an uninhabited island it controls in the South Atlantic. That drew fire from environmentalists as well as U.S. officials, who fear it could encourage even worse abuse, undermining international fisheries management.  Leibowitz in his ruling sided with the U.S. government’s interpretation of its treaty obligations, warning that the U.K.'s eschewing of the procedures established by CCAMLR risked overfishing in a sensitive part of the South Atlantic and undermining the very essence of the treaty. “Unlimited fishing would by no means further the goals of CCAMLR to protect the Antarctic ecosystem,” he wrote. “Allowing one nation to refuse to agree on a catch limit for a particular fish only to then be able to harvest that fish in unlimited quantities would contravene the expressed purposes of CCAMLR.” The ruling effectively extends an existing ban on imports from all U.K.-licensed fishing vessels operating near South Georgia, which is also claimed by Argentina. However, the fish is still available in the U.S. from suppliers authorized by Australia, France and other countries in areas where Russia did not object to the proposed catch limits. Chilean sea bass from South Georgia was for years some of the highest-priced seafood at U.S. supermarkets and for decades the fishery was a poster child for international cooperation, bringing together global powers like Russia, China and the U.S. to protect the chilly, crystal blue southern ocean from the sort of fishing free-for-all seen elsewhere on the high seas. Southern Cross originally filed it lawsuit in the U.S. Court of International Trade but it was moved last year to federal court in Ft. Lauderdale, where the company received two shipments of seabass from a British-Norwegian fishing company in 2022. An attorney for Southern Cross, which doesn’t have a website and lists as its address a waterfront home in a Houston suburb, declined to comment. Environmental groups praised the ruling. “Allowing any country to sidestep agreed limits and fish freely undermines decades of hard-won international cooperation and threatens one of the last intact marine ecosystems on the planet,” said Andrea Kavanagh, who directs Antarctic and Southern Ocean work for Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy. But some fishing industry executives said caving to Russia’s geopolitical posturing unnecessarily hurts American consumers and businesses. “Blocking access to the resource will not improve the fishery’s sustainability but could very well cost U.S. jobs and exacerbate food inflation,” said Gavin Gibbons, the chief strategy officer for The National Fisheries Institute, America’s largest seafood trade association. — This story was supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation.

Crocodile attacks in Indonesia are on the rise. It’s left residents on edge,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2140,AP News,,17-03-25,"BUDONG-BUDONG, Indonesia (AP) — Nearly seven months after a crocodile attack almost took her life, Munirpa walked to the estuary outside her home with her husband and her children, ready to brave a reenactment. Munirpa, who like many Indonesians only uses one name, recounted how one early morning in August, she threw her household garbage into a creek about 50 meters (164 feet) away from her house, as she normally would. She didn’t see what was coming next. Munirpa, a crocodile attack survivor, stands for a portrait at the location where she was nearly killed by a four-meter-long crocodile, in Topoyo, West Sulawesi, Indonesia, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  By the time she realized a crocodile had attacked her, the four-meter-long (13-foot) beast had already sunk its teeth into most of her body, sparing only her head. She fought hard, trying to jab its eyes. Her husband, hearing her screams, ran over and tried to pull her by the thigh out of the crocodile’s jaws. A tug-of-war ensued; the reptile whipped him with its tail. Fortunately, he saved Munirpa in time, eventually dragging her out of the crocodile’s grip. People have long feared the ancient predators in the Central Mamuju district of Indonesia’s West Sulawesi, where the Budong-Budong River meets the sea. For Munirpa, 48, that fear turned into a brutal reality when she became one of nearly 180 recorded crocodile attack victims in Indonesia last year. Residents like her are learning to coexist with the crocodiles, a legally protected species in Indonesia, as they balance conservation with looking out for their safety. But as attacks rise, several residents and experts have called for better government interventions to stop the problem from getting even worse.   A crocodile warning sign is displayed by the river in Budong-Budong, West Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. The sign reads “Beware of crocodile! Please be on alert while doing activities in the river. Crocodile might be stalking”. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  Following the attack, Munirpa was hospitalized for a month and has had two surgeries. By February this year, her fear was still clearly visible, as were the scars on her legs and thighs. “I am so scared. I don’t want to go to the beach. Even to the back of the house, I don’t dare to go,” said Munirpa. “I am traumatized. I asked my children not to go to the river, or to the backyard, or go fishing.” In the villages surrounding the Budong-Budong River, like Munirpa’s, crocodiles have become a daily topic of conversation. Their presence has become so common that warning signs now mark the areas where they lurk, from the river mouth to the waterways which were once a popular swimming spot for children. In 2024, there were 179 crocodile attacks in Indonesia, the highest number of crocodile attacks in the world, with 92 fatalities, according toCrocAttack, an independent database. Social media videos showing crocodile appearances and attacks in Sulawesi and other regions in Indonesia are also on the rise.

(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  The increase in attacks began about 12 years ago with the rise of palm oil plantations around the river mouth, said 39-year-old crocodile handler Rusli Paraili. Some companies carved artificial waterways, linking them to the larger part of the Budong-Budong River. That was when the crocodiles started straying, leaving the river and creeping to nearby residential areas, such as fish and shrimp ponds, he explained. Palm oil plantations now dominate the landscape in West Sulawesi, from the mountains to the coast, and patrolling for crocodiles has become part of people’s daily routine. When residents check the water pumps in their ponds, they have no choice but to keep out an eye for the beasts — flashlights in hand, scouring up, down and across canals and waterways — resigned to the uneasy reality of sharing their home with a predator.  Crocodiles, mostly rescued after encounters with people, swim inside an enclosure in Budong-Budong, West Sulawesi, Indonesia, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  The saltwater crocodile has been a legally protected species in Indonesia since 1999, making it an animal that cannot be hunted freely. As a top predator, there is also no population control in nature. Paraili, the crocodile handler, said that while the law protects crocodiles from being killed, the rise in attacks is a major concern. In response, he’s taken care of some of the crocs in a specially-designed farm away from human populations. He’s received some financial support from the government and community donations, as well as support from palm oil companies for the last five years. The farm has four ponds and around 50 reptiles. Some have names: Tanker, the largest, shaped like a ship, or Karossa, named after the sub-district the animal was caught after fatally attacking someone. When funds run low, he uses his own money to ensure they’re fed, at least once every four days. A crocodile nicknamed Karossa, after the name of a village it was captured from following the fatal attack of a man, rests with others inside an enclosure in Budong-Budong, West Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025. (AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  Amir Hamidy, who studies reptiles at the National Research and Innovation Agency, worries the rise in attacks indicates that crocodile numbers are becoming far too dangerous. Hamidy supports better population control. Being a protected species “does not necessarily mean that the population cannot be reduced when it is at a level that is indeed unsafe,” he said.

(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  Around a year ago in Tumbu village, Suardi, who goes by one name, was harvesting coconuts when they fell into the river. When he went to retrieve them, he was attacked by a crocodile he initially didn’t notice. He’s since made a full recovery. Still, the experience has made him more cautious. “Yes, I am worried. But what else can we do,” Suardi said. “The important thing is that we are careful enough.” Along with Munirpa, Suardi is one of 10 people in the region who was attacked by a crocodile last year. Three of those attacked were killed. Suardi, a crocodile attack survivor, shows a scar on his chest in Budong-Budong, West Sulawesi, Indonesia, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025.

(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  Suyuti Marzuki, who’s head of West Sulawesi Marine and Fisheries Agency, said the crocodile habitat shift is making people’s everyday activities — like harvesting coconuts, fishing or even disposing of garbage like Munirpa — very risky. Marzuki said the government is looking at possible options that can provide both safety and economic alternatives for residents. While he acknowledged that crocodile population numbers and ecosystems need to be protected, Marzuki also raised the possibility of bolstering the local economy through the crocodile skin trade. That industry is controversial because of conservation and animal welfare issues.

(AP Photo/Dita Alangkara)  Paraili, the crocodile handler, also urged serious government interventions. “This is a matter of human lives. So when the government is not serious, then our brothers and sisters in the future — in 5 or 15 years — there will be even more who will die from being attacked by crocodiles,” he said. Residents like Munirpa and Suardi are waiting for more immediate and realistic steps from the authorities to ensure their community’s and families’ safety. “It is enough that I’ve been bitten by a crocodile,” Munirpa said. “I won’t let it happen to my children.” A fisher walks in the water after setting up a fishing net near a beach in Budong-Budong, West Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, Monday, Feb. 24, 2025.

The fringes of space beckoned 66 miles (107 kilometers) up and provided a few precious minutes of weightlessness. Sanchez, a helicopter pilot and former TV journalist, invited the others along for the 10-minute, fully automated flight, packing on the star power with singer-songwriter Perry and “CBS Mornings” co-host King. Moved by the views of Earth below, Perry said she couldn’t resist singing “What a Wonderful World” in space. Also sharing the ride were film producer Kerianne Flynn; Aisha Bowe, a former NASA engineer who started her own companies to promote science education; and Amanda Nguyen, a scientist who studied planets around other stars and now advocates for survivors of sexual violence.  This combination of 2025 file photos shows, from left, Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry and Gayle King. (Photos by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  Blue Origin declined to say how much the flight cost or who paid what. The trip came two months before Sanchez and Bezosmarry in Venice. It was the 11th human spaceflight for the Washington state-based company, founded by Bezos in 2000 after making a fortune with Amazon. Bezos strapped in for Blue Origin’s first space tourist flight in 2021 and accompanied the latest crew to the pad.  The celebrity launch was the nation’s first spaceflight where women filled each seat. The only other all-female crew in 64 years of human spaceflight was back in 1963. That’s when Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova launched by herself, becoming the first woman in space. Tereshkova spent three days off the planet. Even after the latest launch, women represent barely 15% of the more than 700 people who have traveled into space. Sanchez said she deliberately chose women to launch with her, each of them eager to inspire both the young and old to dream big, and even commissioned special flight suits.  This image taken from video provided by Blue Origin shows the New Shepard rocket blasting off in West Texas, Monday, April 14, 2025. (Blue Origin via AP)  The launch brought out VIPs to West Texas including Oprah Winfrey; Kris Jenner and other members of the Kardashian family; former NASA astronaut Mae Jemison, who became the first Black woman in space in 1992; and several women who previously have flown on private flights. Winfrey, a close friend of King, wiped away tears when the capsule reached space and the passengers were heard marveling at the moon and shouting with joy. As the women were buckling up for the ride back, Perry broke into song. Despite urging by her crewmates, she resisted singing “Roar” or her other tunes and instead chose “What a Wonderful World.” “It’s not about me. It’s not about singing my songs,” Perry said following the flight. “It’s about a collective energy in there. It’s about us.” At a news conference later, she stressed, “We weren’t just taking up space. We were making space for the future.” Bezos opened the capsule’s hatch minutes after touchdown, embracing Sanchez, the first one out. As they emerged, Perry and King kneeled and kissed the ground. “Oh my God, that was amazing,” said King, who considers herself an anxious airplane flyer. Three hours later, Sanchez said she was still trying to process everything. “Profound is like the one word I would use,” she said. This wasn’t the first Blue Origin launch with marquee names. “Star Trek” actor William Shatner caught a lift to space with Blue Origin in 2021 at age 90, soon after Bezos’ inaugural trip. He was followed by former New York Giants defensive end and TV host Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the eldest daughter of Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the rocket is named. Two aviation pioneers who missed out on space when they were younger — Wally Funk and Ed Dwight — also rocketed away at ages 82 and 90, respectively. Most of Blue Origin’s passengers — 58 counting the latest launch — have been business or science types, TV hosts or YouTubers. Ticket prices are not disclosed.

Two decades later, a Russian actress filmed aboard the International Space Station. Elon Musk’s SpaceX also sells multi-day trips to private customers. SpaceX’s first client to fly, billionaire tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman already has launched twice and performed the first private spacewalk. He’s now set to become NASA’s next administrator if confirmed by the Senate. Chinese-born bitcoin investor Chun Wang just returned from the first spaceflight to carry people over the north and south poles.

"Ancient jawbone from Taiwan belongs to a mysterious group of human ancestors, scientists say",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2147,AP News,Christina Larson,10-04-25,"An ancient jawbone discovered in Taiwan belonged to an enigmatic group ofearly human ancestorscalled Denisovans, scientists reported Thursday. Relatively little is known about Denisovans, an extinct group ofhuman cousinsthat interacted withNeanderthalsand our own species, Homo sapiens. “Denisovan fossilsare very scarce,” with only a few confirmed finds in East Asia, said study co-author Takumi Tsutaya at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies in Japan. So far, the only knownDenisovanfossils include partial jawbones, a few teeth and part of a finger bone found in caves in Siberia and Tibet. Some scientists believe fossils found in a cave in Laos may also belong to Denisovans. The probable identification of the jawbone from Taiwan as Denisovan expands the region where scientists know these ancient people once lived, said Tsutaya. The partial jawbone was first recovered when a fishing operation dredged the seafloor in the Penghu Channel near the Taiwan Strait. After it was sold to an antique shop, a collector spotted it and purchased it in 2008, then later donated it to Taiwan’s National Museum of Natural Science. This photo provided by researchers in April 2025 shows the coast of Taiwan’s Penghu Islands at low tide in January 2024, and how the shallow sea extends out, near where a fossil jawbone was found in the Penghu Channel. (Takumi Tsutaya via AP)  Based on the composition of marine invertebrates found attached to it, the fossil was dated to the Pleistocene era. But exactly which species of early human ancestor it belonged to remained a mystery. The condition of the fossil made it impossible to study ancient DNA. But recently, scientists in Taiwan, Japan and Denmark were able to extract some protein sequences from the incomplete jawbone.  An analysis showed some protein sequences resembled those contained in the genome of a Denisovan fossil recovered in Siberia. The findings werepublished in the journal Science. While the new research is promising, Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institution’s Human Origins Project, said he would like to see further data before confirming the Taiwan fossil as Denisovan. Potts, who was not involved in the new research, praised the study for “a fantastic job of recovering some proteins.” But he added, such a small sliver of material may not give a full picture. At one time, at least three human ancestor groups — Denisovans, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens — coexisted in Eurasia and sometimes interbred, researchers say. “We can identity Neanderthal elements and Denisovan elements” in the DNA of some people alive today, said Tsutaya. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Soil from the moon’s far side suggests drier conditions than the side facing Earth,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2148,AP News,Marcia Dunn,9-04-25,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Soil and rocks returned from themoon’s mysterious far sidesuggest it may be drier than the side constantly facing Earth, Chinese scientists reported Wednesday. But they cautioned more samples are needed for a clearer picture. A better understanding of theabundance of waterin the lunar mantle can help explain how the moon evolved, the researchers noted. But it could also be all the more reason for astronauts to stick close to thenear side of the moonas currently planned. China became the first country to land on themoon’s far sidelast year. The Chang’e 6 spacecraft scooped up the volcanic rock and dirt from the ancient, sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest impact craters in the solar system. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Sen Hu said he and his team received 5 grams of soil samples, then selected 578 particles for detailed analysis using electron microscopes. They estimated the water abundance at less than 1.5 micrograms per gram, on the dry end of what’s been found in samples gathered over past decades from the moon’s near side. Measurements on samples from the near side have ranged between 1 microgram and 200 micrograms per gram. Given the limited sampling, it’s uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature. “More far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling” how much water there is, Hu said in an email.  It’s possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres. Even if confirmed, the findings shouldn’t drastically alter NASA’s plans to send astronauts to the moon’s south polar region, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold massive amounts of ice. This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel. NASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon from 1969 through 1972. That would be followed by a landing near the lunar south pole by astronauts no earlier than 2027.

Billionaire spacewalker highlights Mars trip for astronauts in his bid to become NASA’s next chief,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2149,AP News,Marcia Dunn,9-04-25,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The nominee for NASA’s top job,billionaire spacewalker Jared Isaacman, outlined his vision for space exploration on Wednesday that prioritizes sending astronauts to Mars without giving up on the moon. “It’s imperative that we do both,” Isaacman told senators. President Donald Trumpnominated Isaacmanto become NASA’s 15th administrator late last year. If confirmed, thetech entrepreneurwould become the youngest person to lead the space agency and among only a handful of administrators to have actually rocketed into orbit. The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee gathered in Washington for the nomination hearing. Besides Isaacman, nine other experienced space travelers were in the audience, including NASA’s next moon crew and passengers who flew on private spaceflights with him. Isaacman assured the senators that he would not give up on the moon and wants the U.S. to beat China in landing astronauts there. “I didn’t say we shouldn’t go to the moon,” he said. “What’s taking so long to get back to the moon and why does it cost so much money? I absolutely want to see us return to the moon.” Moon and Mars expeditions can be developed in parallel. “I don’t think these are either-or,” he added. NASA can afford both under current funding, he said, without elaborating. Isaacman, 42, has already flown in space twice, buying his own trips with SpaceX, and performed the world’s first private spacewalk last September. An experienced jet pilot, he made his fortune with a payment processing company he started as a high school dropout in his parents’ basement, now called Shift4.  He acknowledged in his testimony that he is not “a typical nominee for this position.” “I have been relatively apolitical; I am not a scientist and I never worked at NASA,” he said. “I do not think these are weaknesses.” The space agency and others were anxious to hear Isaacman’s stand on the moon and Mars for human exploration, given his close association with SpaceX’s Elon Musk. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the committee’s chairman, urged the need to “stay the course” with NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the moon. “An extreme shift in priorities at this stage would almost certainly mean a red moon, ceding ground to China for generations to come,” Cruz said. NASA has been pitching the moon as the next logical step for astronauts for years. The Artemis program aims to send a crew around the moon next year and land astronauts near the moon’s south pole as early as 2027. Lunar bases are planned this time around, not just quick visits like the ones during NASA’s Apollo missions in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Artemis has been slow going and expensive, especially for NASA’s Space Launch System rocket. It’s only blasted off once so far — in 2022 without a crew. Musk favors Mars as a destination, as he ramps up more test flights out of Texas for Starship, the world’s biggest and most powerful rocket. By making Starship reusable, he intends to dramatically lower costs of getting people and equipment to the red planet. NASA has chosen Starship for its first two astronaut landings on the moon under Artemis, named after Apollo’s twin sister in Greek mythology. When asked if Musk has contacted him since his nomination about how to manage NASA, Isaacman replied, “not at all.” Isaacman then was questioned how he would protect against undue influence from Musk, given SpaceX’s billions of dollars’ worth of contracts with NASA. “I absolutely want to be clear,” Isaacman said. “My loyalty is to this nation, the space agency and their world-changing mission.” Isaacman said he supports continuing the International Space Station through 2030, as currently planned by NASA. Musk suggested earlier this year that the space station should be dumped as soon as possible in order to focus on Mars. When pressed by senators again before the hearing ended, Isaacman said the space station should keep going until it’s replaced by private outposts in orbit. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A micromoon will grace the night skies this weekend,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2150,AP News,Adithi Ramakrishnan,8-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — There’s a micromoon coming up. The full moonwill look slightly smaller and dimmer on Saturday night. But the change may be tricky to spot with the naked eye. “It’s a very subtle difference,” said astrophysicist Alain Brizard from Saint Michael’s College in Vermont. The phenomenon happens whenthe moonis at a point farthest away from Earth. It’s opposite to asupermoon, where the moon swings closer to Earth and looks a bit larger.

They created a 3D image of it based on their findings. The nearly 200 foot (60-meter) asteroid looks more like a flat disk — or not-quite-round hockey puck — than a potato. It also has a rapid rotation rate of about once every 20 minutes. “This find was rather unexpected since most asteroids are thought to be shaped like potatoes or toy tops rather than flat disks,” the research team lead, Bryce Bolin from Eureka Scientific said in a statement. Scientists said it most likely originated in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and is rich in silicates. At one point earlier this year, NASA and the European Space Agency put the odds of the asteroid striking Earth in 2032 at 3%. It’s now down to virtually zero for the next century, but there’s a 3.8% chance it could strike the moon instead. Even if that happens, NASA assures the moon’s orbit will not be altered. The asteroid —- which swings our way every four years — will be too far away by next week for ground telescopes to see. The Webb Space Telescope will take another look later this month or next.  Scientists consider all this good practice for when a potentially killer asteroid heads our way. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Scientists genetically engineer wolves with white hair and muscular jaws like the extinct dire wolf,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2152,AP News,Christina Larson,8-04-25,"Three genetically engineered wolves that may resemble extinct dire wolves are trotting, sleeping and howling in an undisclosed secure location in the U.S., according to the company that aims tobring back lost species. The wolf pups, which range in age from three to six months old, have long white hair, muscular jaws and already weigh in at around 80 pounds — on track to reach 140 pounds at maturity, researchers atColossal Biosciencesreported Monday. Dire wolves, which went extinct more than 10,000 years old, are much larger than gray wolves, their closest living relatives today. Independent scientists said this latest effort doesn’t mean dire wolves are coming back to North American grasslands any time soon. “All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else""— not fully revive extinct species, said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research. Colossal scientists learned about specific traits that dire wolves possessed by examining ancient DNA from fossils. The researchers studied a 13,000 year-old dire wolf tooth unearthed in Ohio and a 72,000 year-old skull fragment found in Idaho, both part of natural history museum collections. Then the scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites, said Colossal’s chief scientist Beth Shapiro. They transferred that genetic material to an egg cell from a domestic dog. When ready, embryos were transferred to surrogates, also domestic dogs, and 62 days later the genetically engineered pups were born.  Colossal has previously announced similar projects to genetically alter cells from living species to create animals resembling extinct woolly mammoths, dodos and others. Though the pups may physically resemble young dire wolves, “what they will probably never learn is the finishing move of how to kill a giant elk or a big deer,” because they won’t have opportunities to watch and learn from wild dire wolf parents, said Colossal’s chief animal care expert Matt James. Colossal also reported today that it had cloned four red wolves using blood drawn from wild wolves of the southeastern U.S.'s critically endangeredred wolf population. The aim is to bring more genetic diversity into the small population of captive red wolves, which scientists are using to breed and help save the species. This technology may have broader application for conservation of other species because it’s less invasive than other techniques to clone animals, said Christopher Preston, a wildlife expert at the University of Montana who was not involved in the research. But it still requires a wild wolf to be sedated for a blood draw and that’s no simple feat, he added. Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team met with officials from the U.S. Interior Department in late March about the project. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum praised the work on X on Monday as a “thrilling new era of scientific wonder” even as outside scientists said there are limitations to restoring the past. “Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can’t perform those functions” on today’s existing landscapes, said Buffalo’s Lynch. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

A day at Uranus just got 28 seconds longer,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2153,AP News,Marcia Dunn,7-04-25,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — A day atUranusjust got a little longer. Scientists reported Monday that observations by theHubble Space Telescopehave confirmed it takes Uranus 17 hours, 14 minutes and 52 seconds to complete a full rotation. That’s 28 seconds longer than estimates byNASA’s Voyager 2spacecraft in the 1980s. A French-led team studied a decade’s worth of aurora observations at the ice giant to track its magnetic poles. That long-term tracking provided a more precise rotation period for Uranus, the seventh planet from the sun. From that distance, it takes about 84 Earth years for Uranus to orbit the sun. This image provided by ESA/Hubble showcases 3 frames from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope of the dynamic aurora on Uranus in Oct. 2022. (ESA/Hubble via AP)  “The continuous observations from Hubble were crucial,” lead author Laurent Lamy of the Paris Observatory said in a statement. Lamy and his international team said this new approach can help pinpoint the rotation of any world with auroras and a magnetosphere. Published in the journal Nature Astronomy, the findings come a few weeks before the 35th anniversary of Hubble’s launch.

Four space tourists return to Earth after a private flight over the poles,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2154,AP News,Marcia Dunn,4-04-25,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — Fourspace touristswho orbited thenorth and south polesreturned to Earth on Friday, splashing down in the Pacific to end their privately funded polar tour. Bitcoin investor Chun Wang chartered aSpaceXflight for himself and three others in a Dragon capsule that was outfitted with a domed window that provided 360-degreeviews of the polar capsand everything in between. Wang declined to say how much he paid for the 3 1/2-day trip. The quartet, who rocketed fromNASA’s Kennedy Space Centeron Monday night, returned off the Southern California coast. It was the first human spaceflight to circle the globe above the poles and the first Pacific splashdown for a space crew in 50 years. The Chinese-born Wang, now a citizen of Malta, invited Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips, all of whom shared stunning vistas during their voyage. “It is so epic because it is another kind of desert, so it just goes on and on and on all the way,” Rogge said in a video posted by Wang on X while gazing down from orbit. Mikkelsen packed the capsule with camera equipment and spent much of her time behind the lens. All four suffered from space motion sickness after reaching orbit, according to Wang. But by the time they woke up on day two, they felt fine and cranked open the window cover right above the South Pole, he said via X.  Besides documenting the poles from 270 miles (430 kilometers) up, Wang and his crew took the first medical X-rays in space as part of a test and conducted two dozen other science experiments. They named their trip Fram2 after the Norwegian sailing ship that carried explorers to the poles more than a century ago. A bit of the original ship’s wooden deck accompanied the crew to space. Their medical tests continued at splashdown. All four got out of the capsule on their own, heaving bags of equipment so researchers could see how steady returning space crews are on their feet. They pumped their fists in jubilation. SpaceX said its decision to switch splashdown sites from Florida beginning with this flight was based on safety. The company said Pacific splashdowns will ensure that any surviving pieces of the trunk — jettisoned near flight’s end — falls into the ocean. The last people to return from space to the Pacific were the three NASA astronauts assigned to the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

NASA’s Webb telescope captures photos of the asteroid that won’t hit Earth in 2032,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2155,AP News,Marcia Dunn,2-04-25,"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The Webb Space Telescope has captured pictures of theasteroidthat caused a stir earlier this year when it topped Earth’s hit list. Discovered late last year, the asteroid2024 YR4was predicted at one point to have a 3% chance ofsmacking Earthin 2032. Additional observations prompted scientists to reduce the threat tovirtually zero, where it remains. But there’s a slight chance it could hit the moon then. The asteroid swings our way every four years. NASA and the European Space Agency released the photos — showing the asteroid as a fuzzy dot — on Wednesday. Webb confirm the asteroid is nearly 200 feet (60 meters) across, or about the height of a 15-story building, according to the two space agencies. It’s the smallest object ever observed by the observatory, the biggest and most powerful ever sent into space. Johns Hopkins University astronomer Andrew Rivkin said the observations by Webb served as “invaluable” practice for other asteroids that may threaten us down the road. Ground telescopes also have tracked this particular space rock over the past few months. All this “gives us a window to understand what other objects the size of 2024 YR4 are like, including the next one that might be heading our way,” Rivkin, who helped with the observations, said in a statement. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Wall Street and the dollar tumble as investors retreat further from the United States,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2156,AP News,Stan Choe,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are tumbling Monday as worries aboutPresident Donald Trump’s trade warand his criticism of the Federal Reserve cause investors to pull further from the United States. The S&P 500 was 3.1% lower in another wipeout, and the index at the center of many 401(k) accounts is more than 16% below its record set two months ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,138 points, or 2.9%, as of 1:21 p.m. Eastern time. Tesla and other Big Tech stocks had some of the sharpest losses, which dragged the Nasdaq composite down a market-leading 3.4%. Perhaps more worryingly, thevalue of the U.S. dollaralso sank as a retreat continues from U.S. markets. It’s an unusual move because the dollar has historically strengthened during past episodes of nervousness. But this time around, it’s policies directly from Washington that are causing the fear and potentially weakening the dollar’s reputation as a pillar of the global economy. Trump continued his tough talk on global trade over the weekend, even as economists and investors continue to say his stiff proposed tariffs could causea recessionif they’re not rolled back. U.S. talks last week with Japan have so far failed to reach a deal that could lower tariffs and protect the economy, and they’re seen as a “test case,” according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “The golden rule of negotiating and success: He who has the gold makes the rules,” Trump said in all capitalized letters on his Truth Social Network. He also said that “the businessmen who criticize tariffs are bad at business, but really bad at politics,” likewise in all caps.  Trump has recently focused more on China, the world’s second-largest economy, which upped its own rhetoric against the world’s largest economy. China on Mondaywarned other countriesagainst making trade deals with the United States “at the expense of China’s interest” as Japan, South Korea and others try to negotiate agreements. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. Also hanging over the market areworries about Trump’s anger at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump last weekcriticized Powell againfor not cutting interest rates sooner to help give the economy more juice. The Fed has beenresistant to lowering rates too quicklybecause it does not want to allowinflationto reaccelerate after it has slowed nearly all the way down to its 2% goal from more than 9% three years ago. Trumptalked again on Mondayabout a slowing for the U.S. economy that could be coming unless “Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates.” A move to fire Powell would likely send a huge bolt of fear through financial markets. While investors always love lower interest rates, because they boost prices for stocks and other investments, the larger worry would be that a less independent Fed would be less effective at keeping inflation under control in the long run. Such a move could further weaken, if not kill, the United States’ reputation as the world’s safest place to keep cash. On Wall Street, several Big Tech stocks helped lead indexes lowerahead of their latest earnings reportsdue later this week. Tesla sank 7.4%, for example. The electric vehicle’s stock came into Monday roughly 50% below its record set in December on criticism that its stock price had gone too high and that itsbrand has become too entwinedwith Elon Musk, who’s leading the U.S.government’s efforts to cut spending. Nvidiafell 6.1% and was on track for a third straight drop after disclosing that new U.S. export limits on chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. It was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500. A 3.4% drop for Apple, 2.5% fall for Microsoft and 4% slide for Amazon were close behind. It was another wipeout on Wall Street, and 98% of the stocks within the S&P 500 were falling. Among the few gainers was Discover Financial Services, which climbed after theU.S. government approved its proposed merger with Capital One Financial. Discover rose 2.7%, while Capital One edged higher by 0.7%. Gold was also rising, burnishing its reputation as a safe-haven investment, unlike some others. In the bond market, shorter-term Treasury yields fell as investors keep alive hopes that the Fed may cut its main overnight interest rate later this year in order to support the economy. Longer-term yields swiveled up and down, though, as doubtscontinue to rise about the United States’ standingin the global economy because of Trump’s moves. The yield on the 10-year Treasury reached 4.40%. That’s up from 4.34% at the end of last week and from just about 4% earlier this month. That’s a substantial move for the bond market. The U.S. dollar’s value, meanwhile, fell against the euro, Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and other currencies. In stock markets abroad, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.3%. Indexes fared better in Seoul, where stocks rose 0.2%, and in Shanghai, which saw a 0.4% gain. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.",Economy,1
"China to retaliate with sanctions on US officials, NGO leaders over Hong Kong issues",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2157,AP News,Kanis Leung,21-04-25,"HONG KONG (AP) — China will sanction United States officials, lawmakers and leaders of non-governmental organizations who it says have “performed poorly” on Hong Kong issues, the foreign ministry announced. The U.S. in Marchsanctioned six Chinese and Hong Kong officialswho it alleged were involved in “transnational repression” and acts threatening to further erode the city’s autonomy. Theofficialsincluded Justice Secretary Paul Lam, security office director Dong Jingwei and former police commissioner Raymond Siu. In a retaliatory move against Washington, D.C., on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun in Beijing said China strongly condemned the acts, calling them “despicable.” The U.S. has seriously interfered in the affairs of Hong Kong and violated international law principles, he said “China has decided to impose sanctions on U.S. congressmen, officials, and NGO leaders who have performed poorly on Hong Kong-related issues,” Guo said, adding the response was made according to the anti-foreign sanctions law. He did not provide more details about who is being targeted. Guo also issued a warning about Hong Kong, saying the southern Chinese city’s affairs are not subject to U.S. interference. Any actions considered wrong by the Chinese government that are taken on Hong Kong-related issues will be met with firm countermeasures and reciprocal retaliation, he said.  The tit-for-tat sanctions over Hong Kong’s human rights issues are the latest sign of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington, which are already locked ina trade warthat has rattled businesses on both sides. Beijing separately warned other countries on Monday against making trade deals with the U.S. to China’s detriment. The U.S. sanctions on officials in March were not the first related to the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. DuringDonald Trump’sfirst presidential term, his governmentimposed sanctionson Hong Kong and Chinese officials for undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy. In 2021, former President Joe Biden’s administrationslapped more sanctionson officials over Beijing’s crackdown on political freedoms in the semi-autonomous city. Since China imposed a national security law in 2020 to quell the 2019 massive anti-government protests, Hong Kong authorities have prosecuted many of the city’s leading activists. Media outlets known for their critical reports of the government shut down following arrests of their top management. Dozens of civil society groups disbanded. Over the past two years, Hong Kong authorities have issuedarrest warrants for 19 activists based overseas, with bounties of $1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,536) for information leading to each of their arrests. Some of them resided in the U.S. The years-long crackdown has drawn criticism from foreign governments, especially because the city was promised its Western-style civil liberties and semi-autonomy would be kept intact for at least 50 years during the 1997 handover.

Big Tech’s ‘Magnificent Seven’ heads into earnings season reeling from Trump turbulence,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2158,AP News,Michael Liedtke,21-04-25,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry’s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn’t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago. Since President Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid anonslaught of tariffsand other potentially detrimental actions. It’s the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when theyassembled behind Trumpas he was sworn in. That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump’s second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden’s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunitiesin artificial intelligenceanddeal-making. But the Trump administration’s policies so far have vexed Big Tech’s “Magnificent Seven” companies — a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump’s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20. The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump’s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech’s supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.  That has left the specter of Trump’s ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world. “The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump’s tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators’ allegations thatMeta has been running an illegal monopolyin social networking, and working to persuade a federal judgeto break up Googleafter its search engine last year was found to beillegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobbleAppleandAmazon. And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company torecord a $5.5 billion chargeto account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country. Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies’ financial reports for the January-March quarter. The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that itsfirst-quarter car sales dropped by 13%from the same time last year. The decline occurred against a backdrop ofvandalism,widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycottamid a backlash to Musk’s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies. After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla’s market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: ; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Amazon and Apple on May 1.

China warns countries against making trade deals with the US unfavorable to Beijing,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2159,AP News,,21-04-25,"BEIJING (AP) — China on Monday warned other countries against making trade deals with the United States to China’s detriment. Governments including those of Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have begun negotiations with Washington after President Donald Trumpannounced sweeping tariffsagainst almost all of America’s trading partners on April 2. The import taxes were quickly paused against most countries after markets panicked, but he increased his already steep tariffs against China. “China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement. “If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures in a reciprocal manner. China is determined and capable of safeguarding its own rights and interests.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this month the countries currently negotiating trade deals with the U.S. should “approach China as a group” together with Washington. The U.S. tariffs against other countries are economic bullying, the ministry said in the statement attributed to an unnamed spokesperson. “Appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot win respect,” it added. “For one’s own temporary selfish interests, sacrificing the interests of others in exchange for so-called exemptions is like seeking the skin from a tiger. It will ultimately only fail on both ends and harm others without benefiting themselves.”  China said it’s open to talks with Washington but no meetings have been announced. Trump made China the target of his steepest tariffs, imposing several rounds of tariffs totaling 145% duties on Chinese imports. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs of 125% on U.S. imports. The tariffs have spooked exporters andstalled shipments, while threatening to drag on the global economy.",Economy,1
Google faces off with US government in attempt to break up company in search monopoly case,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2160,AP News,Michael Liedtke,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Google is confronting an existential threat as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into an illegal monopoly. The drama began to unfold Monday in a Washington courtroom as three weeks of hearings kicked off to determine how the company should be penalized for operating a monopoly in search. In its opening arguments, federal antitrust enforcers also urged the court to impose forward-looking remedies to prevent Google from using artificial intelligence to further its dominance. “This is a moment in time, we’re at an inflection point, will we abandon the search market and surrender them to control of the monopolists or will we let competition prevail and give choice to future generations,” said Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a “remedy hearing,” are set to feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai. The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser. Google’s attorney, John Schmidtlein, said in his opening statement that the court should take a much lighter touch. He said the government’s heavy-handed proposed remedies wouldn’t boost competition but instead unfairly reward lesser rivals with inferior technology.  “Google won its place in the market fair and square,” Schmidtlein said. The moment of reckoning comes four-and-a-half-years after the Justice Department fileda landmark lawsuitalleging Google’s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet’s main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade. After the case finally went to trial in 2023,a federal judge last year ruledGoogle had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software. That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google’s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998. Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers. Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that — no matter what occurs — Google always wins,” the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. “The American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.” Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden’s term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google’s immense power as a threat to freedom, too. In his opening statement, Dahlquist noted that top officials from the Justice Department were in the room to watch proceedings. He said their presence indicated that the case had the full support of federal antitrust regulators, both past and present. “The fact that this case was filed in 2020, tried in 2023, under two different administrations, and joined by 49 states demonstrates the non-partisan nature of this case and our proposed remedies,” Dahlquist said. Dahlquist also said that Mehta would be hearing a lot about AI — “perhaps more than you want, your honor,” — and said top executives from AI companies, like ChatGPT, would be called to testify. He said the court’s remedies should include provisions to make sure that Google’s AI product, Gemini, isn’t used to strengthen its existing search monopoly. “We believe that Google can and will attempt to circumvent the court’s remedies if it is not included,” Dahlquist said. “Gen AI is Google’s next evolution to keep their vicious cycle spinning.” Schmidtlein, Google’s attorney, said rival AI companies had seen enormous growth in recent years and were doing “just fine.” Google is also sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. “The breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers,” Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. The showdown over Google’s fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals. The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup — a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court. Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta’s ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can’t do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day. The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social mediain another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against bothAppleandAmazon, too. The Justice Department also targeted Google’s digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week inanother federal judge’s decisionthat found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year. ___ Liedtke reported from San Francisco.",Economy,1
"Trump renews attack on Federal Reserve Chair Powell, Dow Jones tumbles 1,000 points",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2161,AP News,Christopher Rugaber,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump repeated hisattacksMonday against the chair of the Federal Reserve, demanding that the central bank lower its key interest rate to boost the economy. TrumpcalledPowell “a major loser” and said that energy and grocery prices are “substantially lower” and “there is virtually No Inflation.” Yet Trump said the economy could slow without rate cuts. Gas prices have fallen for the past two months, in part because oil costs have dropped on fears of slower growth, butfood pricesjumped in January and March andoverall inflationremains above the Fed’s 2% target. Trump’s comments drovethe stock market and the dollar loweras investors in the U.S. and overseas grow increasingly wary about the economic standing of the U.S. On Friday, a top White House adviser said the administration is studying whether it can fire Powell, a move that would undermine the Fed’s independence and likely send shock waves through global financial markets. The stock market, which fell immediately at the opening bell Monday, tumbled further after Trump’s post, with Dow dropping by more than 1,000 points and the broad S&P 500 stock index falling nearly 3% in mid-day trading. The dollar fell to a three-year low. The Federal Reserve was established as an independent agency and most economists think central banks that are free of political interferencedo a better job at keeping inflation in check. Otherwise, it would be harder for the Fed to take unpopular steps to keep prices down, such as raising interest rates.  The interest rate on 10-year Treasuries has been rising as Trump rolled out aggressive tariff policies against trading partners and continues to attack Powell and the Federal Reserve. The interest rate ticked higher again on Monday to 4.37%. The dollar losing value isunusualwhen stock prices fall and Treasury yields rise because investors typically buy U.S. government bonds during market turmoil, driving down the yield. Instead, investors appear to be avoiding U.S. markets due to the perception of rising risk. Trump also criticized Powell for being “too late” to move on interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have long acknowledged that they waited too long to raise rates when inflation was first ignited in 2021. But right now, Powell hasunderscoredthat the Fed faces a potentially “challenging scenario.” Trump’s tariffs could worsen inflation, and the Fed would typically respond to rising prices by keeping its rate elevated, or even raising it. Yet the economy could also slow because of the duties, which the Fed would normally seek to counter with rate cuts. “Our tool only does one of those two things at the same time,” Powell said last week. As a result, Powell has underscored that the Fed will stay on the sidelines as it waits to see how the tariff policies play out. Trumplashed out at Powell on Fridayand said he could fire him if he wanted, though it would likely touch off a legal battle that could go to the Supreme Court. Powell has said the presidentlacks the authorityto fire him and has made clear he won’t step down until his term ends in May 2026. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, when asked Friday whether firing Powell is an option, said that Trump “and his team will continue to study that matter.” Hassett also accused Powell of acting politically. Trump made a similar claim in his Truth Social post, accusing the Fed chair of cutting rates last year “in order to help Sleepy Joe Biden, later Kamala, get elected.” The Fed reduced its key rate three times in late 2024 as inflation cooled and out of concern that hiring was also slowing, though it later rebounded. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and added that, “I don’t think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.” “The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,” he said. Also Sunday, Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve’s Chicago branch, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that undermining the Federal Reserve’s independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth, and less hiring. And William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, said Trump’s attacks on the Fed aren’t “going to make the American people better off over time.” “They’ll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,” he said.",Economy,1
Trump’s attacks on Powell threaten the Fed’s independence. Here’s why it matters,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2162,AP News,Christopher Rugaber,18-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has stepped uphis attackson Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the same time that the Supreme Court is considering a case that could make it easier for the president to fire him. The developments are occurring against a backdrop of wider turmoil in the economy and financial markets, brought on by Trump’ssweeping taxes on imports. Most economists worry that an assault on the Fed’s longstanding independence from politics would further disrupt markets and addto the uncertaintyenveloping the economy. In comments at the White House Thursday, Trump suggested he has the power to remove Powell and criticized him for not aggressively cutting interest rates. “If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump said. “I’m not happy with him.” All the scrutiny threatens the Fed’s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here are some questions and answers about the Fed.  The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls — which it typically doeswhen the economy falters— the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate — which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation — it can weaken the economy and cause job losses. Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive. The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after theextended inflation spikeof the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide. Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed’s short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping ratestriggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests. Yet Volcker didn’t flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker’s willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed. An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed. If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate — or understand — its decisions. Well, no. Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed’s governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years, though most governors leave before the end of their terms. Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed’s policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed five of the current seven members: Powell, Lisa Cook, Philip Jefferson, Adriana Kugler, and Michael Barr. As a result, Trump will have fewer opportunities to make appointments. He will be able to replace Kugler, who filled an unexpired term ending Jan. 31, 2026. Congress, meanwhile, can set the Fed’s goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a “dual mandate” to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%. The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy. Powell says the law establishing the Fed does not allow a president to fire a chair except for cause. There is some complication in that Powell was separately appointed as a member of the Fed’s board of governors, and then elevated to the position of chair — by Trump, in 2017. Most legal scholars agree that Trump can’t fire Powell from the Fed’s board of governors, but there is less agreement over whether a president can remove him as chair. In January, Michael Barr, who was vice chair for supervision,stepped downfrom that post but remained on the board to avoid a potential legal clash over whether Trump could fire him. Should Trump try to fire Powell anyway, the ensuing fight would almost certainly end up at the Supreme Court. We may get an early sign of how the Supreme Court would decide it this summer. There is already a case before the court on the issue of whether the president can fire top officials at independent agencies. The case stems from Trump’s firings of two officials, one from the National Labor Relations Board and the other from an agency that protects workers from political interference. The Supreme Court last weeklet the firings standwhile it considers the case. It could rule this summer that the president, as the head of the executive branch, could fire officials at any federal agency even if Congress had intended it to be independent. The case would overturn a 90-year old precedent known asHumphrey’s Executor, in which the court ruled that the president couldn’t fire such officials. Powell said Wednesday he is watching the case closely, adding that it might not apply to the Fed. Lawyers for the Trump administration, seeking to narrow the focus of the case, have argued that it doesn’t involve the Fed. Both the Trump administration and the Supreme Court justices have carved out exemptions for the Fed before. In February, the White Houseissued an executive orderthat placed several financial regulatory agencies, including the Fed and the Securities and Exchange Commission, more directly under the president’s control. Yet the order specifically exempted the Fed’s ability to set interest rates from that order. And in acase in 2023, Justice Samuel Alito said in a footnote that the Fed is a “unique institution with a unique historical background” that made it different than other independent bodies. If the court does give presidents more power over the heads of independent agencies, it could potentially exempt the Fed.",Economy,1

Trump on Thursday offered some encouraging signals that negotiations with other countries could lead to lower tariffs, which is what Wall Street is hoping for. The uncertainty about what will happen in Trump’s on-again-off-again rollout of tariffs, though, could damage the economy by itself. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell helped send stocks lower Wednesdaywhen he reiteratedthat Trump’s tariffs appear to be larger than the central bank was expecting, which could in turn slow the economy and raise inflation more than it had earlier thought. That could set up a dilemma for the Fed. It could cut interest rates to help the economy, but that would also push inflation higher. It has no good tool to fix both at the same time. Powell said again on Wednesday that the Fed would wait to see how conditions play out more before moving on interest rates. Trumpcriticized that stanceThursday, saying the Fed is “always TOO LATE AND WRONG.” He also said, “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” That could spook Wall Street. An independent Fedable to act without influencefrom the White House is one of the primary reasons the United States has benefited from its reputation as a safe place to invest. History suggests central banks with more autonomy tend to have economies with lower and more stable inflation. Research also suggests Trump’s past attacks on the Fed in favor of lower interest rates may have helped drive expectations in financial markets for lower rates, which in turn may have had some influence on the Fed. But conditions are different this time around from when inflation was low during Trump’s first term. “This request for lower rates could backfire if markets perceive that going forward the Fed will be less committed to low and stable inflation,” said Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.32% from 4.29% late Wednesday. It had been easing for much of this week, following last week’s scary rise.

"How to file for an extension, and other Tax Day advice",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2165,AP News,Cora Lewis,15-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — If you’ve waited till the last minute to file your taxes, don’t panic. You still have time to get it done. And if you’re worried that you still might not be able to finish in time, you can file for an extension, which will give you until Oct. 16 to file your return. Generally, every tax-filer needs the following at hand — your Social Security number — W-2 forms, if you’re employed — 1099-G forms, if you’re unemployed — 1099 forms, if you’re self-employed — Savings and investment records — A sense of any eligible deductions, such as education expenses, medical bills, charitable donations, etc. — A sense of relevant tax credits, such as the child tax credit, retirement savings contributions credit, etc. To find a more detailed document list, visit theIRS website. Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government relations at theNational Association of Tax Professionals,recommends gathering all your documents in one place before you start your tax return, as well as having your documents from last year if your financial situation has drastically changed. Theresa Grover, site coordinator for theVolunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) programat Northeast Wisconsin Technical College, also recommends taxpayers create anidentity protection PIN numberwith the IRS to guard against identity theft. Once you create a number, the IRS will require it to file your tax return.  If you run out of time to file your tax return, you can file for anextensionto take more time by using your preferred tax software, with theIRS Free Filetool, or via mail. However, it’s important to remember the extension is only to file your tax return, not to pay owed taxes. If you owe taxes, you should pay an estimated amount before the deadline to avoid paying penalties and interest. If you expect to receive a refund, you’ll still receive your money when you file your taxes. The deadline to file for an extension is Tuesday, April 15, which will give you until Oct. 16 to file. Many people fear getting in trouble with the IRS if they make a mistake. To avoid common errors: — Double check your name on your Social Security card. When working with clients, O’Saben always asks them to bring their Social Security card to double-check their number and their legal name, which can change after marriage, for example. “You may have changed your name but you didn’t change it with Social Security,” O’Saben said. “If the Social Security number doesn’t match the first four letters of the last name, the return will be rejected and that will delay processing.” — Search for tax statements if you’ve opted out of paper mail. Many people like to opt out of snail mail, but paper mail can also include your tax documents. “If you didn’t get anything in the mail doesn’t mean that there isn’t an information document out there that you need to be aware of and report accordingly,” said O’Saben. — Report all of your income. If you had more than one job in 2024, you need the W-2 forms for each — not just the one from the job you ended the year with, said Christina Wease, interim director of the tax clinic at Michigan State University. For those who make $73,000 or less per year, the IRS offersfree guided tax preparationthat does the math for you. If you have questions while working on your tax forms, the IRS also offers aninteractive tax assistanttool. Beyond TurboTax and H&R Block, taxpayers can also hire licensed professionals, such as certified public accountants. The IRS offers adirectory of tax preparersacross the United States. TheIRS also funds two types of programsthat offer free tax help: Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and the Tax Counseling for the Elderly program (TCE). People who earn $60,000 or less a year, those who have a disability, and those who speak limited English all qualify for the VITA program. Those who are 60 or older qualify for the TCE program.The IRS has a sitefor locating organizations hosting VITA and TCE clinics. If you have a tax problem, there areclinics around the countrythat can help you resolve these issues. Generally, these tax clinics also offer services in other languages such as Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese. ____ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Have you experienced a disaster? You have more time to file your taxes,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2166,AP News,Cora Lewis,14-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — If your life has been upended by awildfire, hurricane, flood, tornado, or another disasterthis past year, the IRS recognizes that you may need more time to file your taxes and grants you an automatic extension beyond the normal filing deadline, which is Tuesday. You’re also permitted to write off a certain amount of loss due to disaster, reducing your tax burden. That could be damaged property, lost income, or small business losses. “It can feel really daunting and overwhelming, after you’ve already lost your home or your vehicle, to tackle that project (of loss write-off). It can take time and a lot of energy,” said Alison Flores, manager at the Tax Institute for H&R Block. “We see people be hesitant to tackle that, and so they leave that loss on the table.” In the wake of a disaster, people are alsomore vulnerable to scams, so be extra vigilant as you prepare your taxes, even with the extra time of an IRS extension. “Scammers often pose as representatives of the IRS or FEMA to exploit victims of disasters,” said Misty Erickson, tax content program manager at the National Association of Tax Professionals. “Common scams include false promises of tax refunds, fake charities soliciting donations, and phishing attempts requesting personal or financial information.” Here’s what you should know:  The IRS keepsan official list online of all disaster locationsthat qualify you for an extension to file. For the past year, individuals and businesses affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton qualify for tax relief, as well as disaster victims in parts ofAlabama,Florida,Georgia,North Carolina,South Carolina,New Mexico,Tennessee,Virginia,West Virginia, andAlaska. Taxpayers in these areas have until May 1 to file returns and make payments, and there’s no need to do any additional paperwork to receive that extra two week grace period. Filers also have the option to request additional extensions to October 15, but interest will accrue if any money due isn’t paid by May 1. Individuals and businesses insouthern California affected by wildfires and straight-line windsalso qualify for automatic extensions due to disaster. Taxpayers in the relevant counties have until Oct. 15 to file returns and make payments. Anyinterest or fees that normally accrueon late payments won’t accrue during disaster extensions. Most direct disaster relief is also not counted as income, and so is not taxed. While nothing is easy in the first days and weeks following a disaster, a few choices can help when seeking insurance reimbursement and at tax time. “We recommend saving media coverage,” said Flores. “If your neighborhood was on the news showing the disaster, write down what date that was or record that copy. Anything that substantiates your losses and what condition your property was in is helpful.” According to the IRS, other steps include: — Taking photographs of damaged property or belongings to document and calculate the amount of your loss. — Keeping receipts for associated expenses, including contracted work on property damaged by disaster. — Keeping records of the original value of any property, including a home, car, jewelry, or big credit card purchases. Filing your insurance claims as soon as possible is also important, as you deduct any insurance reimbursement from disaster losses claimed on your tax return. “When we look at a loss, it’s often damage to your home, furnishings inside your home, vehicles, that kind of thing,” Flores said. “Most of the time, people will have home insurance and auto insurance, and file claims. That’s the first step. The tax deduction is for loss that’s not paid for or reimbursed by your insurance.” The IRS calls this kind of disaster relief “casualty loss.” Claiming casualty loss doesn’t result in dollar-for-dollar reimbursement, but it does lower your tax burden, which can mean more cash to help pay for recovery. Form 4684, which you include when you file your return, walks you through the relevant steps for calculating your casualty write-off. Victims of disasters may deduct their losses in either the year they suffered the loss or in the previous year — in that case, by filing an amended return. In the wake of a disaster, it’s normal to feel vulnerable and to listen to voices that promise relief. But scammers often target disaster victims for exactly this reason. “Taxpayers should be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, emails or texts claiming to be from the IRS or relief agencies,” said Erickson. “The IRS never initiates contact via email, text, or social media to request sensitive information. When in doubt, taxpayers should verify correspondence by calling official numbers directly.” According to the IRS, you should watch out for: — Big paydays: The promise of more money than you think sounds reasonable. Bad advisers may make outlandish statements about available credits. — Threats and demands: Any pressure to pay for tax help “now or else,” mentions of arrest or deportation, or refusals to let you question or appeal the taxes they say you owe. — Suspicious or misspelled website links that aren’t IRS.gov. Scammers may say that they want to “help” you file casualty loss claims or to get big refunds. Always rely on official IRS government websites and beware fishy offers of help with high price-tags or sensational promises. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

Tax tips for recently married couples and first-time parents,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2167,AP News,Adriana Morga,13-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Taxes may not be the first thing on your mind when you celebrate a joyous occasion like a marriage or a new baby. But once you return from your honeymoon or while your newborn is napping, you’ll need to spend some timethinking about them. Keeping yourdocuments organized, updating your withholding and knowing which tax credits you’re eligible for are some crucial steps as couples and parents navigate tax season, said Henry Grzes, lead manager of tax practice & ethics for the American Institute of CPAs. The deadline to file your 2024 taxes is Tuesday. If you run out of time, you can file for anextensionuntil Oct. 15. Here are some expert recommendations if you are filing taxes as a newlywed or new parent. Keeping your tax documents organized is a great practice regardless of your filing year. Having your tax documents in a folder on your personal computer, even if it’s pictures of the documents, can help you have everything in the same place, said Tyler Horn, a certified financial planner and head of planning at Origin, a financial planning app. “Just take a picture with your phone, send it and keep it in that secure folder on your computer. That way you have everything together,” Horn said. It’s also good to keep your records for the future. TheIRS recommendsthat you keep your documents for at least three years and up to seven depending on your situation.  If you changed your last name, you will need to make sure your government documents reflect this. Your tax return must match your Social Security number so, if you choose to change your name, you’ll need to make a change with the Social Security Administration. Oftentimes, people forget to make this change ahead of time, which leads them to make mistakes on their tax returns. “That’s something that people don’t necessarily think about and when they do think about it sometimes it’s it’s too late,” Grzes said. You can find out more about how to change your name on theSocial Security Administration’s website. One of the biggest changes, for tax purposes, when you get married is whether you choose to file your taxes jointly or separately, Horn said. To make this decision, each couple should take a look at their specific situation. In most cases, filing jointly might make the most sense but it’s not always that case, Horn said. One of the benefits of filing jointly is that it gives you access to new tax credits and deductions. It’s important to know that if a couple is married as of Dec. 31, the law indicates that the couple was married for the entire year, Grzes said. So, if you got married in the summer, in the eyes of the IRS you have been married the full year. You can read more about each filing status on theIRS website. If you’re planning to file taxes jointly with your spouse, you must update your W-4 form with your employer. Updating your W-4 is meant to reflect your new filing status, from single to married, as well as updating your tax withholding. Knowing what tax credits and deductions you qualify for is very important when filing your taxes, Horn said. Relevant tax credits for married couples include the Earned Income, American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits. When it comes todeductions, you can either opt for a standard deduction or itemize. Itemizing generally only makes sense if your itemized deductions add up to more than the current standard deduction of $29,200 for a married couple. In some cases, a person that qualifies for the Earned Income Credit as a single filer will no longer qualify if they file jointly with their spouse, Grzes said. To avoid surprises when you’re filing your taxes, Grzes recommends that you work with a tax professional ahead of time. It’s important that you obtain a social security number for your child as soon as you can, Grzes said. The first time you file taxes after you’ve had your new baby, you will be able to apply for several new tax credits, but you can only do so if you claim them as a dependent. “If you’re going to claim your child as a dependent, you have to have a Social Security number and put that number on the return. Otherwise, the IRS is going to deny you,” Grzes said. Usually, hospitals let you apply for a Social Security number registration. However, you can also apply online or at your local Social Security office. To alleviate some of the expenses of having children, the IRS offers several tax credits, including the Child Tax Credit, Childcare Credit and Adoption Credit. Parents also continue to qualify for the Earned Income Credit, which will continue to be based on your earned income and the number of children you have. “The Earned Income Credit clearly provides a significant refund and by having a child, you could increase the amount of income that you could earn and still qualify for that credit,” Grzes said. Parents can benefit from opening tax-free accounts such as a flexible spending account or a 529 account. A flexible spending account (FSA), allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for healthcare and childcare costs, while the 529 account lets you set money aside for education expenses. “It’s worth making sure you are maximizing your tax opportunities,” Grzes said. ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

What to do if you can’t pay the taxes you owe,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2168,AP News,Cora Lewis,28-03-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — If you know or suspect you can’t pay thetaxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information or file for an extension. That’s the top piece of advice that tax professionals want you to know. “The IRS wants to work with you,” said Tom O’Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. “But if you’re asking the IRS for some help, they have to know something about you. So the first thing is to have that return filed. The number one takeaway is that owing money is not a reason not to file.” If you don’t file a return or ask for an extension, then interest and penalties begin to accrue immediately. Those costs are largely avoidable if you share the information about your circumstances with the IRS in a timely way. Filing a return without paying taxes owed in full is preferable to not filing.  To be clear, if you don’t pay all the taxes you owe by the April 15 filing deadline, interest will accrue even if you’ve been granted an extension to October, but that interest will be more manageable than fees that add up when you pay no taxes at all. “The worst case scenario is that you don’t file and end up being liable for penalties later on,” said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. “That’s not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans.” Here’s what to know:  In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you don’t have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file. Yes.Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sitesacross the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. TheIRS Direct File programis also free to use. “While the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money you’re owed, too,” said DiVito. “Most taxpayers — certainly most working taxpayers — get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place.” If you’ve experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in “currently-not-collectible” status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify. “Let’s say you’ve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. You’ve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief,” said O’Saben. “Then the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit they’re having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do.” There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an “offer in compromise.” VITA tax professionals can also help you see if you’re eligible, or you can usea free IRS tool online. That’s OK. Start now. “I’ve been doing taxes for more than 35 years,” said O’Saben. “The number one reason people don’t file is that they have a feeling they may owe — which could be wrong — and they don’t want to face it. But it’s not a problem that’s going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you.” Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this. “It’s perfectly okay,” he said. “The IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. There’s nothing they haven’t seen.” ___ The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

"US tariffs will weaken global economy and trigger inflation but not a global recession, IMF says",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2169,AP News,Christopher Rugaber,17-04-25,"Surging U.S. tariffs will weaken the global economy and push up inflation this year, according to projections to be released next week by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, said Thursday that the Trump administration’s sharp increases in duties have caused global uncertainty to spike. The import taxes will slow global growth, but not cause a worldwide recession, she added. The details of the IMF’s outlook will be issued Tuesday. The world economy’s resilience is being tested “by the reboot of the global trading system” that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said. That turbulence has beenplaying out in financial marketsfor weeks now, especially on Wall Street, which has experienced wild swings from day-to-day and often times even hour-to-hour. The IMF chief also echoed some Trump administration concerns. She called on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade, a process that she said had stalled out in the past decade after making steady progress for many years after World War II. “Trade distortions — tariff and nontariff barriers — have fed negative perceptions of a multilateral system seen to have failed to deliver a level playing field,” she said. “This feeling of unfairness in some places feeds the narrative: we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty.” Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said.  Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added. In its most recent projectionsissued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trump’s policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports. The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024. Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026. However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the fund’s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce “are likely to push inflation higher in the near term.’’ Those forecasts from January are expected to change — possibly significantly — as Trump’s trade war hasescalated in recent months,particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China. Trump haspaused or pulled backon many of his tariff threats — leading to more volatility in the stock market — but has been in a tit-for-tattariff battle with Chinaand has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.

China’s economy grew 5.4% in the first quarter as exporters rushed to beat Trump’s tariffs,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2170,AP News,Elaine Kurtenbach,16-04-25,"BANGKOK (AP) — China’s economy expanded at a 5.4% annual pace in January-March, the government said Wednesday, supported by strong exports ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s rapid increases in tariffs on Chinese products. With the trade war clouding the outlook, analysts are forecasting that the world’s second largest economy will slow significantly in coming months, however, as tariffs as high as 145% on U.S. imports from China take effect. Beijing has hit back at the U.S. with 125% tariffs on American exports, while also stressing its determination to keep its own markets open to trade and investment. Chinese leaderXi Jinping’s visitsis visiting several other Asian countries this week as he makes a case for free trade, presenting China as a source of “stability and certainty” in uncertain times.  Xi was visiting Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia, while the U.S. announced that a senior State Department official, Sean O’Neill, would be traveling this week to Vietnam’s capital Hanoi and to Ho Chi Minh City, to Cambodia’s Siem Reap and to Tokyo. China also has been highlighting its focus on trade with countries other than the United States at various trade fairs that are showcasing its vast market and competitiveness as a manufacturing giant. At China’s Canton trade fair, in the southern city of Guangzhou, exporters were emphatic about the need to look beyond selling to Americans. “We need to diversify our market. When the West is dark, the East is bright. The global market is huge,” said Wallace Huang, the export business director of Guangdong Weking Group, which makes rice cookers. “In recent years, our exports to the U.S. have slowly been declining.”  Exports helped China’s economy expand at a 5% annual rate in 2024 and this year’s official target is about 5%.  In the near term, the tariffs will put pressure on China’s economy, but they won’t derail long-run growth, Sheng Laiyun, a spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters. He noted that China’s exports to the United States have fallen to less than 15% of total exports from more than 19% five years ago. “China’s economic foundation is stable, resilient and has great potential. We have the confidence, ability and confidence to cope with external challenges and achieve our established development goals,” Sheng said. In quarterly terms the economy grew 1.2% in January-March, slowing from 1.6% in the last quarter of 2024. Chinese exportssurged more than 12% from a year earlier in March and nearly 6% in U.S. dollar terms in thefirst quarter, as companies rushed to beat Trump’s tariffs. That has supported robust manufacturing activity in the past several months. China’s industrial production rose 6.5% from a year earlier in the last quarter, led by a nearly 11% increase in output of equipment manufacturing. The strongest growth was in advanced technologies, such as production of battery electric and hybrid vehicles, which jumped 45.4% year-on-year. Output of 3D printers soared almost 45% and of industrial robots surged 26%. Despite relatively fast growth by global standards, the Chinese economy has struggled to regain momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic as downturn in the property market has pushed unemployment higher, leaving families wary about spending. Consumer prices fell 0.1% in the first quarter, suggesting that demand is not keeping up with supply for many industries. Investment in real estate also remained weak, falling nearly 10% from a year earlier despite government efforts to spur more lending for housing purchases. The tariffs crisis looms as another massive blow at a time when Beijing is striving to get businesses to invest and hire more workers and to persuadeChinese consumersto spend more. Both private and public sector economists have remained cautious about what to expect, given how Trump haskept switchinghis stance on the details of his trade war. “Given the events over the past two weeks, it is extremely difficult to predict how the U.S. and China tariffs on each other might evolve,” Tao Wang and other UBS economists said in a report. The International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank have stuck with more optimistic forecasts of about 4.6% growth this year. After taking office, Trump first ordered a 10% increase in tariffs on imports from China. He later raised that to 20%. Now, China is facing 145% tariffs on most of its exports to the United States. UBS estimates that the tariffs, if they remain roughly as they are, could cause China’s exports to the United States to fall by two-thirds in coming months and that its global exports could fall by 10% in dollar value. It cut its forecast for economic growth this year to 3.4% from an earlier 4%. It expects growth to slow to 3% in 2026. China hasstepped up effortsto spur more consumer spending and private sector investment over the past seven months, doubling down on subsidies for auto and appliance trade-ins and channeling more funding for housing and other cash strapped industries. ___ AP researchers Yu Bing and Shihuan Chen contributed.",Economy,1
UK economy enjoyed unexpected growth spurt in February before Trump tariff turmoil,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2171,AP News,,11-04-25,"LONDON (AP) — Official figures Friday showed that the British economy, the world’s sixth-largest, enjoyed a growth spurt in February, the month before U.S. President Donald Trump started to roll out tariffs on imported goods. The Office for National Statistics found that the British economy grew by 0.5% in February, ahead of market expectations for a more modest increase of 0.2%. It also revised up January’s figure to no change from the previous estimate of a 0.1% decline. Were these more normal times, hopes for the year ahead would be high. But the recent market turmoil prompted byTrump’s tariff policies— and subsequent abrupt changes — is expected to lead to a downturn around the world, as businesses and consumers retrench in the face of the heightened economic uncertainty. China’s decision to raise tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% from Saturday has only added to fears that the world’s two biggest economies are heading for a drawn-out and damagingtrade war. While welcoming Friday’s growth figures, British Treasury chief Rachel Reeves acknowledged the uncertain outlook. “The world has changed and we have witnessed that change in recent weeks,” she said. “I know this is an anxious time for families who are worried about the cost of living and British businesses who are worried about what this change means for them.” The Labour government has said raising the U.K.’s economic growth is thenumber one priorityover the next five years.

Germany’s economy is expected to be more or less stagnant this year,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2172,AP News,,10-04-25,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s economy is likely to be more or less stagnant in 2025 aftershrinking for two yearsand the impact of U.S. tariffs could weigh down an already unimpressive showing, leading think tanks forecast Thursday. Germany has Europe’sbiggest economyand is the 27-nation European Union’s most populous member. Five economic institutes said in a regular update that they expect minimal growth of 0.1% this year — down from the 0.8% they forecast in September. They predicted growth of 1.3% in 2026. However, they pointedto uncertaintysurrounding the Trump administration’s trade policy. U.S. tariffs on aluminum, steel and vehicle imports are likely to reduce German economic growth this year and next by 0.1 percentage points each, an effect that the new forecast already takes into account, according to their report. The sweeping tariffs announced last week by President Donald Trump and thenlargely put on holdcould double that hit to gross domestic product, the economists said. But they added that “the specific effects are difficult to quantify, as tariff rates have never been raised so sharply in the world’s current globalized economy.” Germany’sprospective new government, which hopes to take office next month after months of political drift in the country, aims to revitalize the economy.

UN researchers warn that Asian scam operations are spreading across the rest of the world,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2173,AP News,Grant Peck,21-04-25,"BANGKOK (AP) — Transnational organized crime groups in East and Southeast Asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities, according to a U.N. report issued on Monday. For several years, scam compounds have proliferated in Southeast Asia, especially in border areas ofCambodia, Laos andMyanmar, as well as in thePhilippines, shifting operations from site to site to stay a step ahead of the police. More recently, scam centers that have bilked victims out of billions of dollars through false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes are now being reported operating as far afield as Africa and Latin America. Asian crime syndicates have been expanding operations deeper into remote areas with lax law enforcement that are vulnerable to the influx, according to the report issued by the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime or UNODC. The report is titled “Inflection Point: Global Implications of Scam Centers, Underground Banking and Illicit Online Marketplaces in Southeast Asia.” “This reflects both a natural expansion as the industry grows and seeks new ways and places to do business, but also a hedging against future risks should disruption continue and intensify in Southeast Asia,” Benedikt Hofmann, UNODC’s acting regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, said in a statement. UNODC estimates that hundreds of industrial-scale scam centers generate just under $40 billion in annual profits.  The trend to hedge beyond the region has been consistent with continued reports of crackdowns targeting Asian-led scam centers that have been found operating in Africa, South Asia, the Middle East and select Pacific islands, as well as related money laundering, people trafficking and recruitment services discovered in Europe, North America and South America. In Africa,Nigeriahas become a hot spot, with police raids in late 2024 and early 2025 leading to many arrests, including people from East and Southeast Asia suspected of cryptocurrency and romance scams. Zambia and Angola have also busted Asian-linked cyberfraud operations. In Latin America, the report says that it’s “notable that Brazil has emerged as one country that has faced a growing set of challenges related to cyber-enabled fraud, online gambling, and related money laundering, with some linkages to criminal groups operating in Southeast Asia.” It also notes that in late 2023 inPeru, more than 40 Malaysians were rescued after being trafficked by a Taiwan-based gang known as the Red Dragon syndicate that forced them to commit cyber-enabled fraud. The report also points to crackdowns on Asian-led scam centers in the Middle East and some Pacific islands. Alarmingly, even as Asian-led groups have been expanding the geographical scope of their operations, the involvement of criminal groups from other parts of the world is also growing, the report says. New online markets, money laundering networks, stolen data products, malware, artificial intelligence and deepfake technologies are laying the ground for the rise of crime as a service, the report says. These technological innovations facilitate conducting their businesses online and adapt to crackdowns. “The convergence between the acceleration and professionalization of these operations on the one hand and their geographical expansion into new parts of the region and beyond on the other translates into a new intensity in the industry — one that governments need to be prepared to respond to,” Hofmann says.",Economy,1
Instagram tries using AI to determine if teens are pretending to be adults,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2174,AP News,Barbara Ortutay,21-04-25,"Instagram is beginning to test the use of artificial intelligence to determine if kids are lying about their ages on the app, parent company Meta Platforms said on Monday. Meta has been using AI to determine people’s ages for some time, the company said, but photo and video-sharing app will now “proactively” look for teen accounts it suspects belong to teenagers even if they entered an inaccurate birthdate when they signed up. If it is determined that a user is misrepresenting their age, the account will automatically become ateen account, which has more restrictions than an adult account. Teen accounts are private by default. Private messages are restricted so teens can only receive them from people they follow or are already connected to.“Sensitive content,” such as videos of people fightingor those promoting cosmetic procedures, will be limited, Meta said. Teens will also get notifications if they are on Instagram for more than 60 minutes and a “sleep mode” will be enabled that turns off notifications and sends auto-replies to direct messages from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. Meta says ittrains its AIto look for signals, such as the type of content the account interacts, profile information and when the account was created, to determine the owner’s age. The heightened measures arrive as social media companies face increased scrutiny over how their platform affects the mental health and well-being of younger users. A growing number of states are also trying to pass age verification laws, although they have faced court challenges.  Meta and othersocial mediacompanies support putting the onus on app stores to verify ages amid criticism that they don’t do enough to make their products safe for children — or verify that no kids under 13 use them. Instagram will also send notifications to parents “with information about how they can have conversations with their teens on the importance of providing the correct age online,” the company said.",Economy,1
Vance and Modi meet in New Delhi to discuss trade deal and avoid US tariffs,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2175,AP News,Sheikh Saaliq,21-04-25,"NEW DELHI (AP) —U.S. Vice President JD Vanceheld talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday as New Delhi looks to avoid American tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington and strengthen ties with the Trump administration. Vance, who is on a largely personalfour-day visitto India, met with Modi at his residence in New Delhi and the two leaders “reviewed and positively assessed the progress in various areas of bilateral cooperation,” Modi’s office said in a statement. They also “welcomed the significant progress” in the negotiations of an expected trade deal between the two countries, the statement said. The U.S. is India’s largest trading partner and the two countries are now holding negotiations aiming to seal a bilateral trade agreement this year. They have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030. If achieved, the trade deal could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties as well. The deal “presents an opportunity to negotiate a new and modern trade agreement focused on promoting job creation and citizen well-being in both countries, with the goal of enhancing bilateral trade and supply-chain integration in a balanced and mutually beneficial manner,” Vance’s office said in a statement. Vance’s first visit to New Delhi came amid the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump’snow-paused tariff programagainst most countries, including India. It also coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between the United States and China, which is New Delhi’s main rival in the region. AP correspondent Jennifer King reports Vice President JD Vance is on a personal and diplomatic trip to India.  Modi’s office said that the two leaders “noted continued efforts towards enhancing cooperation in energy, defense, strategic technologies and other areas” and “exchanged views on various regional and global issues of mutual interest, and called for dialogue and diplomacy as the way forward.” Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Monday that Vance’s visit will “further deepen the India–U.S. comprehensive global strategic partnership.” Vance was greeted with an Indian classical dance performance after he arrived at New Delhi’s Palam airport on Monday, following his visit to Rome, wherehe met with Pope Francison Easter Sunday, a day before the pontiff’s death. Vance was accompanied by his wife, Usha Vance, a practicing Hindu whose parents are from India, along with their three children and officials from the U.S. administration. The family visited the Akshardham Hindu temple in New Delhi after their arrival and are expected to tour the iconic Taj Mahal monument and the 12th-century Amer Fort — a UNESCO world heritage site — during their trip. India is a close partner of the U.S. and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region. It was also part of the Quad, which is made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China’s expansion in the region. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year. Washington has long sought to develop a deeper partnership with New Delhi, which is seen as a bulwark against China. Modi particularly established a goodworking relationshipwith Trump during his first term in office, and the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries. Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. Duringhis visit, he hailed a “mega partnership” with the U.S., and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump’s tariffs. The two leaders also said they planned to grow their defense partnership, with India signaling compliance with the Trump administration’s demands, saying it will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment from the U.S. Modi also has cooperated with Trump’s moves to deport migrants as India has accepted many of its citizens from the U.S. in the past few months. Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy, part of which has since been paused. However, he has continued to call India a “tariff abuser” and “tariff king.” The trade negotiations are especially urgent for India, which could be hit hard by Trump’s tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors. Harsh Vardhan Shringla, India’s former foreign secretary and ambassador to the U.S., said that Vance’s visit comes at a time of global upheaval in world trade. He said ties between New Delhi and Washington could see an upsurge under Trump’s presidency, mainly in technology-sharing and defense. “U.S. trade policy under Trump offers an opportunity for India to embed itself in a bigger way in the U.S. markets and global supply chains,” Shringla said. Modi’s government is also hoping to attract investment from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Last month, Musk’s Starlinkentered into agreementswith two of India’s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services. Musk also indicated that he would visit India later this year after speaking last week with Modi, signaling that there could be progress in the electric carmaker’s push to enter the Indian market. India is also a major defense partner of the U.S. It has in recent years embedded advanced American jets, helicopters, missiles and military gear into its armed forces. The two countries have announced plans to sign a 10-year framework later this year for strengthening their defense partnership. ___ Rajesh Roy contributed to this report.",Economy,1

The hearing is the culmination of over two years of investigation by the Senate that started when state accountants unintentionally exaggerated money given to colleges and universities by $3.5 billion. That led to the discovery of an account error that started a decade ago when the state was changing from one accounting system to another. If accountants couldn’t balance the entries in the two sets of books as they moved thousand of accounts with different definitions, they kept adding it to a special account year after year until it grewto $1.8 billion. It took forensic accountants, who were paid millions of dollars in fees, to finally unravel that nearly all of the $1.8 billion wasnot real moneybut just an accumulation of errors. The two Republican senators calling for Loftis to be kicked out of office said he canno longer be trustedto handle South Carolina’s bank accounts. They charged that he is incompetent and never reported the mistakes to lawmakers as required by law while refusing to take accountability. “He’s a liar that was so concerned with his public appearance that he would do and say anything to cover up his mistake,” Sen. Stephen Goldfinch said.  Loftis has called the Senate investigation awitch hunt. He repeatedly saidno money went missingand the errors were not made in his office, although others have testified differently. The treasurer said continuing to focus on the mistakes threatens the state’s strong credit rating. His lawyer Deborah Barbier opened the treasurer’s three-hour case with a photo of Loftis and Republican President Donald Trump on a screen. She pointed out that he has won election four times and will face voters again in a primary in 14 months. Loftis has previously said he would not run for reelection. “The people don’t want to be told that you are better than them,” Barbier said from a temporary lectern at the back of the state Senate chamber. “Let issues like this be decided at the ballot box.” Senators can ask questions at the end of the hearing. The Senate would need a two-thirds vote to decide Loftis committed “willful neglect of duty” and send the matter to the House, which must also hold its own two-thirds vote to remove the treasurer. Thirty-one of the 40 senators present on Monday will have to vote against Loftis to keep the process going. No office holder has been removed in this way since South Carolina became a state 225 years ago. Republican leaders in the House have given no indication whether they will take up the matter. The books still haven’t been fully straightened out, and accountants continue to struggle with Loftis’ office and how they handle the state’s bank accounts, Grooms said. The treasurer is trying anything to protect his 14 years in office and reputation as a competent conservative steward who is always looking out for taxpayers, Grooms said. “Because of his failures, the self-proclaimed best friend of the taxpayer is costing the taxpayers tens of millions in legal, auditing and oversight fees,” Grooms said. “With friends like this, who needs tax-and-spend liberals.” A Senate subcommitteeheld hearingsto question Loftis under oath. They have been contentious. Loftis has slammed papers, accused senators of a witch hunt and threatened to get up and leave. He did not show any outward signs of frustration or anger as the hearing started Monday.",Economy,1
Special interests poured more than half a billion into California lobbying last year,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2178,AP News,Eremia Kimelman/Calmatters,21-04-25,"Lobbying groups spent more than half a billion dollars to influence the state government in 2024, the most ever, according to a CalMatters analysis ofdata recently filed with the secretary of state. Lobbying by Google, oil companies and utilities during special sessions in the third quarter appeared to drive the sharp spike in spending. Companies and organizations reported roughly $540 million in lobbying expenses to push their point of view to California officials, including legislators, on hundreds of bills between January and December of last year — and that’s up by more than 10% from $485 million in 2023. Perhaps that isn’t so surprising in a state with a full-time Legislature and one of the largest economies in the world, said Francesco Trebbi, an economics professor at UC Berkeley who studies political influence and lobbying. “Half a billion is kind of normal,” he said. “If California is about 14% of U.S. GDP and federal lobbying is about $4 billion, $500 million is about 13% of that. So it would be in line with the size of the California economy.” Thomas Holyoke, a professor of political science at Fresno State University, said that the spending increase might reflect not only corporations’ desire for more influence but also the growing influence of California policy itself. As long as California maintains its prominence, “more and more interest groups and lobbyists are going to take what Sacramento does very, very seriously,” he said. The Western States Petroleum Association reported more than $17.3 million dollars in advocacy costs over the year, more than $10 million of which was spent last summer, and more than double the total bill of the previous year. The organization took public positions on18 bills last sessionand got its desired outcome two-thirds of the time, according to a CalMatters analysis of data fromDigital Democracy, our platform to track state lawmakers and legislation. In part, the trade group’s spending more than doubled because of increased proposed regulations on oil and gas, includinga special sessionfocused on gas prices. The largest non-oil spender was PacifiCorp, which reported spending more than $13.4 million to influence California officials last year, 30 times the yearly average for the company over the last two decades. The investor-owned utility lobbied for a rate hike but didn’t take a public position on any bills in 2024. Pacific Gas & Electric, one of the largest utilities in the state, reported nearly $3.6 million on lobbying last year. Over the two-year legislative session, the company tooka public position on 45 billsand also got its way on roughly two-thirds of them, or 31 bills. Google doesn’t usually spend much on state-level lobbying efforts butspent more in 2024than the last 20 years combined. The company reported one of the largest totals for state advocacy last year, driven primarily by aspending spree in the third quarterof the year when the tech giant was fighting amedia billandAI regulations. The company got its way in both cases. Much of its advocacy went through the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which reported spending nearly $7.4 million, $7 million of which came from the Mountain View behemoth. Only two labor groups spent more than $1 million on lobbying last year: the Service Employees International Union and the California Teachers Association. SEIU reported spending nearly $3.4 million and the California Teachers Association, another powerful union in the state, spent more than $3.1 million. Both unions took public positions on hundreds of bills and got their way nearly 70% of the time. Organizations that hire lobbyists to influence state policy are required to disclose how much money was spent in a quarterly report to the secretary of state, who makes the data and filings availableonline. For example,the pagefor the Western States Petroleum Association shows that the industry group spent roughly $1.7 million on advocacy in the second quarter of last year and more than $10.1 million in the following quarter. CalMatters added quarterly reported expenses to calculate the total annual lobbying bill for each organization, then added every organization’s yearly sum to determine the aggregate amount spent on lobbying California officials per year. Sometimes, organizations give money to industry groups to lobby on their behalf, such as the $7 million Google paid to the Computer & Communications Industry Association, and both organizations must report that money: Google, when it buys advocacy services from the association; the trade group, when it actually spends the money on grassroots organizing or direct lobbying. Because there’s no way to determine if a payment is to another “lobbyist employer” or to a political or media consulting firm, there are amounts reported more than once in our data. CalMatters determined the success rate of each organization by comparing organizations’ public positions taken on bills in the last legislative session (2023–2024) as recorded inDigital Democracyto the ultimate outcome of that legislation. Lobbying efforts were considered successful if either of the following were true: 1. The organization opposed a bill that failed the Legislature. 2. The organization supported a bill that passed through the Legislature (even if it was vetoed by the Governor). It’s difficult to get a more detailed picture of lobbying because of what isn’t reported in the data. California does not require disclosure of either the offices or staff members who meet with lobbyists or the connections between individual lobbyists and specific bills. Our analysis found that corporate lobbying efforts were successful about 60% of the time. This is likely an undercount because it can take more than one year to successfully pass a bill. Micheli said that sometimes a bill can even take more than one two-year legislative session. “After six or seven years on a really tough bill, you finally get it enacted. Leading up to it, you could say you failed every year,” he said. “But then eventually, you get a seismic change in the law.” ___ This story was originally published byCalMattersand distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.",Economy,1
World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab retires as chairman,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2179,AP News,,21-04-25,"GENEVA (AP) — Klaus Schwab, the founder of theWorld Economic Forum, best known for hosting an annual meeting of political, business and other elites in the Swiss Alpine town of Davos, is retiring as chairman more than a half-century after creating the Geneva-based think tank, the forum said Monday. The forum quoted Schwab, 87, in a statement as saying he was stepping down “with immediate effect.” Former Nestle Chairman and CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe was unanimously selected as interim chairman by the forum’s board at a special meeting on Sunday, the statement said. A search committee has been set up to choose a permanent successor. The forum’sannual gathering in Davoshas for decades served as a global hub where decision-makers, academics, leaders of international organizations, and elite business executives rub shoulders to discuss government policy, global crises and deal-making. The gathering, typically in January, has hosted a long list of world leaders under Schwab’s 55-year tenure, including President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia, Donald Trump of the United States, and many more heads of state and government. “At a time when the world is undergoing rapid transformation, the need for inclusive dialogue to navigate complexity and shape the future has never been more critical,” the forum said in the statement, underlining its mission as a “facilitator of progress” that will continue to bring together leaders to exchange ideas and build cooperation.",Economy,1
Chipotle heads south of the border with opening of 1st location in Mexico,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2180,AP News,Dee-Ann Durbin,21-04-25,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is coming to Mexico. The California-based chain said Monday it’s planning to open a restaurant in Mexico early next year, its first location south of the border in its 30-year history. Chipotleis partnering with Alsea in Mexico City, a company that operates Domino’s, Starbucks, Burger King, Chili’s and other brands in South America and Europe. Alsea plans to explore additional expansion in Mexico and other locations in the region. Nate Lawton, Chipotle’s chief business development officer, said the company is confident that its menu will resonate with Mexican diners. “The country’s familiarity with our ingredients and affinity for fresh food make it an attractive growth market for our company,” Lawton said in a statement. But at least one U.S.-based Mexican chain has struggled to make it in Mexico. Taco Bell opened a few outlets in Mexico City in 1992 but they closed within two years. The brand opened another store in Monterrey, Mexico, in 2007 which also didn’t last. The expansion arrives as President Donald Trump’stariffs on Mexican importscould increase costs for U.S. Chipotle locations. Last week, the U.S. Commerce Department said itplans to withdrawfrom a 2019 agreement suspending an antidumping investigation into fresh tomato imports from Mexico. That termination, set to take effect July 14, means most tomatoes from Mexico will be subject to a 20.91% tariff.  Chipotle gets around half of its avocados from Mexico, but so far those are not subject to tariffs. Chipotle, which was founded in Denver in 1993, has 3,700 restaurants and plans to open up to 345 new locations this year. It has been focused on growing its international footprint. Last year, it partnered with Alshaya Group to open a restaurant in Kuwait, its first new market in a decade. It now has three restaurants in Kuwait and two in the United Arab Emirates.",Economy,1
Thai-Chinese company denies flouting safety measures in probe of skyscraper collapse following quake,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2181,AP News,Jintamas Saksornchai,21-04-25,"BANGKOK (AP) — A Thai-Chinese company denied Monday allegations its steel rods did not passsafety standard testsafter nationwide criticism prompted an investigation into the collapse of a high-rise building under construction after an earthquake last month in Bangkok. Authorities are probing Xin Ke Yuan Steel and another Chinese contractor involved in the construction to find out why the building crumbled following a quake centered in Myanmar, more than 800 miles (1,200 kilometers) away. It was the only building that completely collapsed that day. The 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28killed more than 3,700 in Myanmar, while in Thailand, 47 were killed, mostly at the collapse site, and 47 others went missing. The collapsesparked questions about the enforcement of construction safety and the state-run Chinese contractor, China Railway No. 10 Engineering Group, leading to the arrest Saturday of its Chinese executive in Thailand, identified as Zhang, on suspicion of operating the business through the use of nominees. Foreigners can operate a business in Thailand, but it must be a joint venture with a Thai partner, and they cannot own more than 49% to protect local competitiveness. Three Thai shareholders of the company are also wanted on suspicion of being the nominees, said officials of the Department of Special Investigation, Thailand’s equivalent of the FBI. They also said they were looking into the quality of the construction material and whether the company illegally fixed its bidding.  The company posted a video online last year advertising the building, meant to be a new office of the State Audit Office, with plenty of drone footage and boasting about the quality of the design, construction and management of the project. Last week, a Thai engineer filed a police complaint saying that his name and signature were forged as a project controller in one of the construction plans. He denied any involvement in the project. Xin Ke Yuan Steel, also partly owned by Chinese nationals, came under scrutiny over the quality of the steel rods they provided for the buildings. Its operating license is currently suspended following a fatal fire accident in December at its factory in Rayong province. Industry Minister Akanat Promphan said two types of steel rods found at the collapse site did not pass safety standards and that Xin Ke Yuan supplied both. He raided the company’s factory on April 11 for evidence, saying that samples of the steel products confiscated by authorities following its December suspension have already failed two tests. The company’s legal team disputed Monday the test results in a press conference, stressing that all of their products had passed safety tests and that they were being treated unfairly by authorities. They, however, declined to comment when asked specifically about the test results of the company’s steel rods found at the collapse site. Earlier this month, the Revenue Department filed a complaint accusing Xin Ke Yuan of issuing over 7,000 false tax invoices. The company’s lawyers on Monday denied any wrongdoing. The search for the missing workers is still ongoing, Thai authorities say.",Economy,1
Trump’s tough talk might help Liberal Mark Carney win a full term as Canada’s prime minister,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2182,AP News,Rob Gillies,21-04-25,"TORONTO (AP) — Mark Carney’s political career is only months old, and it’s already been a roller-coaster ride. The former central banker appeared destined to become one of Canada’s shortest-serving prime ministers until U.S. President Donald Trump picked a fight with the neighboring country. Carney, who was sworn in on March 14 followingJustin Trudeau’s resignationand a Liberal Party leadership race, now leads in the polls heading into the April 28 parliamentary election, marking a dramatic turnaround for a party that seemed destined for a crushing defeat until Trumpstarted attacking Canada’s economy and sovereigntyalmost daily. Trump’s trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state have infuriated Canadians and led to asurge in nationalismthat has helped the Liberals flip the election narrative.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  In a mid-January poll by Nanos, Liberals trailed the Conservative Party by 47% to 20%. In the latest Nanos poll, which was conducted during a three-day period that ended April 20, the Liberals led by eight percentage points. The January poll had a margin of error 3.1 points, while the latest poll had a 2.7-point error margin. “Timing is everything in politics, and Carney entered the political arena at a most favorable time,” said Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. Carney’s opponent isConservative leader Pierre Poilievre, acareer politician and firebrand populistwho has campaigned with Trump-like swagger, even taking a page from the “America First” president by adopting the slogan “Canada First.”  “This election is a test about whether Canada will embrace or reject populism,” Béland said, suggesting many voters view Carney as reassuring because of his experience and calm. “Without the Trump effect, the Conservatives would probably be in a much stronger position in the polls right now,” he said. “If Trump wasn’t currently in the White House, it would be hard to imagine the Liberals being the favorites in this federal race, considering how unpopular they were just a few months ago.” Mark Carney, Leader of the Liberal Party of Canada, embraces Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after being announced the winner at the Liberal Leadership Event in Ottawa, Ontario, March 9, 2025. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press via AP, File)    Carney navigated crises when he ran Canada’s central bank and when he later became the first non-U.K. citizen to run the Bank of England since its founding in 1694. His Bank of England appointment won bipartisan praise in the United Kingdom, after Canada recovered from the 2008 financial crisis faster than many other countries. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called it “extraordinary” that a country would choose a foreigner to head its central bank, and that it’s a mark of how admired Carney is. “He is calm and cool in a crisis,” Paulson said. “He’s a clear thinker and he understands finance cold. He’s very well prepared.” Carney, 60, is credited with keeping money flowing through the Canadian economy by acting quickly in cutting interest rates to their lowest level ever, working with bankers to sustain lending through the financial crisis and, critically, letting the public know that rates would remain low so they would keep borrowing.

(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  He was the first central banker to commit to keeping them at a historic-low level for a definite time — a step the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow. Carney also helped manage the worst impacts of Brexit in the U.K. Paulson said that Carney has the “perfect background” for these challenging times. “Everything he’s done, he’s excelled at. Every job — the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England,” Paulson said. “I don’t know anyone who has dealt with him that doesn’t respect him. Whether they agree or disagree with him, they respect him. He’s got a very, very nice manner.” Both Conservative and Liberal prime ministers tried to make Carney their finance minister, the second-most powerful position in Canada’s government. Former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper named Carney the Bank of Canada governor and later offered to make him finance minister. Trudeau, Carney’s Liberal predecessor, long wanted him as his finance minister. Carney is a former Goldman Sachs executive. He worked for 13 years in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003.

When he was 6, his family moved to Edmonton, where his mother taught school and his father became a professor of education history at the University of Alberta. Carney earned a partial scholarship to Harvard University, where he was the backup goalie on the hockey team. Influenced by John Kenneth Galbraith, who pioneered the popular notion that economics should be accessible to the masses, Carney took up economics. A married father of four, Carney earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from Harvard in 1988, and master’s and doctoral degrees in economics from Oxford University.  Canada Liberal Leader Mark Carney talks to the media as he leaves the prime minister’s office and makes his way to a caucus meeting in Ottawa on March 10, 2025. (Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press via AP, File)    Carney has said that Canada’sclose friendship with the U.S. has ended, and he squarely blamed Trump. Trump mocked Carney’s predecessor by calling him Governor Trudeau. He hasn’t trolled Carney. But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this month that Trump hadn’t changed his position that Canada “would benefit greatly by becoming the 51st state.” Carney said that the 80-year period when the U.S. embraced the mantle of global economic leadership and forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect is over. “There is no going back. We in Canada will have to build a new relationship with the United States,” he said. If elected, Carney said that he would accelerate renegotiations of the free trade deal with the U.S. in an effort to end the uncertainty hurting both economies. “President Trump is trying to fundamentally restructure the international trading system and in the process he’s rupturing the global economy,” Carney said. “The core question is who is going to be at the table for Canada,” he said.",Economy,1
Secondhand stores are poised to benefit if US tariffs drive up new clothing costs,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2183,AP News,Anne D’Innocenzio,21-04-25,"NEW YORK (AP) — Stores selling secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories are poised to benefit from PresidentDonald Trump’strade wareven asbusinesses the world overrace to avert potential damage, according to industry experts. American styles carry international influence, butnearly allof the clothing sold domestically is made elsewhere. The Yale University Budget Lab last week estimated short-term consumer price increases of 65% for clothes and 87% for leather goods, noting U.S. tariffs “disproportionately affect” those goods. Such price hikes may drivecost-conscious shoppersto online resale sites, consignment boutiques and thrift stores in search of bargains or a way to turn their wardrobes into cash. Used items cost less than their new equivalents and only would be subject to tariffs if they come from outside the country. “I think resale is going to grow in a market that is declining,” said Kristen Classi-Zummo, an apparel industry analyst at market research firm Circana. “What I think is going to continue to win in this chaotic environment are channels that bring value.” The outlook for pre-owned fashion nevertheless comes with unknowns, including whether the president’s tariffs will stay long enough to pinch consumers and change their behavior. It’s also unclear whether secondhand purveyors will increase their own prices, either to mirror the overall market or in response to shopper demand. Jan Genovese, a retired fashion executive, sells her unwanted designer clothes through customer-to-customer marketplaces like Mercari. If tariffs cause retail prices to rise, she would consider high-end secondhand sites. “Until I see it and really have that sticker shock, I can’t say exclusively that I’ll be pushed into another direction,” Genovese, 75, said. “I think that the tariff part of it is that you definitely rethink things. And maybe I will start looking at alternative venues.” The secondhand clothing market already was flourishing before the specter of tariffs bedeviled the U.S. fashion industry. Management consulting firm McKinsey and Co. predictedafter the COVID-19 pandemicthat global revenue from pre-owned fashion would grow 11 times faster than retail apparel sales by this year as shoppers looked to save money or spend it in amore environmentally consciousway. While millennials and members of Generation Z were known as the primary buyers of used clothing, data from market research firm Sensor Tower showsthe audience may be expanding. The number of mobile app downloads for nineresale marketplacesthe firm tracks — eBay, OfferUp, Poshmark, Mercari, Craigslist,Depop, ThredUp, TheRealReal and Vinted — increased by 3% between January and the end of March, the first quarterly gain in three years, Sensor Tower said. The firm estimates downloads of the apps for eBay, Depop, ThredUp and The RealReal also surged compared to a year earlier for the week of March 31, which was when Trump unveiledsince-paused punitive tariffson dozens of countries. Circana’s Classi-Zummo said that while customers used to seek out collectible or unusualvintage piecesto supplement their wardrobes, she has noticed more shoppers turning to secondhand sites to replace regular fashion items. “It’s still a cheaper option” than buying new, even though retailers offer discounts, she said. Poshmark, a digital platform where users buy and sell pre-owned clothing, has yet to see sales pick up under the tariff schedule Trump unveiled but is prepared to capitalize on the moment, CEO Manish Chandra said. Companies operating e-commerce marketplaces upgrade their technology to make it easier to find items. A visual search tool and other improvements to the Poshmark experience will “pay long dividends in terms of disruption that happens in the market” from the tariffs, Chandra said. Archive, a San Francisco-based technology company that builds and manages online and in-store resale programs for brands including Dr. Martens, The North Face and Lululemon, has noticed clothing labels expressing more urgency to team up, CEO Emily Gittins said. “Tapping into all of the inventory that is already sitting in the U.S., either in people’s closets or in warehouses not being used,” offers a revenue source while brands limit or suspend orders from foreign manufacturers, she said. “There’s a huge amount of uncertainty,” Gittins said. “Everyone believes that this is going to be hugely damaging to consumer goods brands that sell in the U.S. So resale is basically where everyone’s head is going.” Stock analysts have predicted off-price retailers like TJ Maxx and Burlington Stores will weather tariffs more easily than regular apparel chains anddepartment storesbecause they carry leftover merchandise in the U.S. Still, resale vendors aren’t immune fromtariff-induced upheavals, said Rachel Kibbe, founder and CEO of Circular Services Group, a firm that advises brands and retailers on reducing the fashion industry’s environmental impact. U.S. sellers that import secondhand inventory from European Union countries would have to pay a 20% dutyif Trump moves forwardwith instituting “reciprocal” tariffs on most trading partners and eliminates an import tax exception for parcels worth less than $800, Kibbe said. A circular fashion coalition she leads is seeking a tariff exemption for used and recycled goods that will be offered for resale, Kibbe said. Trumpalready endedthe duty-free provision for low-value parcelsfrom China, a move that may benefit sellers of secondhand clothing by makinglow-priced Chinese fashionspricier, she said. James Reinhart, co-founder and CEO of the online consignment marketplace ThredUp, said the removal of the “de minimis” provision andthe 145% tariffTrump put on products made in China would benefit businesses like his. He doubts creating resale channels would make a big difference for individual brands. “Brands will explore this and they may do more, but I don’t see them massively changing their operations,” Reinhart said. “I think they’re going to be figuring out how to survive. And I don’t think resale helps you survive.” Rebag, an online marketplace and retail chain that sells used designer handbags priced from $500 to tens of thousands of dollars, expects tariffs to help drive new customers and plans to open more physical stores, CEO Charles Gorra said. Gorra said the company would analyze prices for new luxury goods and adjust what Rebag charges accordingly. The two historically rose in tandem, but Rebag could not match Chanel’s 10% price increase last year because of lower resale demand, Gorra said. “That has nothing to do with the tariffs,” he said. “Consumers are feeling priced out.” Norah Brotman, 22, a senior at the University of Minnesota, buys most of her own clothes on eBay. She also thrifts fashions from the 1990s and early 2000s at Goodwill stores and resells them on Depop. If tariffs upendthe economics of fast fashionand discourage mindless consumption, Brotman would count that as a plus. “I would love if this would steer people in a different direction,” she said.",Economy,1
Trump’s transportation officials buck a long-held practice of using ‘road diets’ to slow speeders,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2184,AP News,Jeff McMurray,21-04-25,"A stylist was just starting her shift at a salon in Kansas City, Missouri, when a car smashed through the storefront window and landed in the waiting area a few feet away. Such crashes were so common along 31st Street that business owners regularly texted one another photos showing thedamage caused by vehiclesspeeding along the four-lane road lined with shops, bars and restaurants, which drivers used as a shortcut between major highways. “A wide road makes people think, ‘We’ll just drive as fast as we want on it,’” said Ryan Ferrell, who owns the property housing the salon, a bookstore and apartments above. Whenconcrete sidewalk barriersdidn’t work, Ferrell and other business leaders campaigned to put the street on a “road diet.” Removing laneshas been a tool numerous cities have used for years to calm traffic, despite resistance from some Republican governors. PresidentDonald Trump’sadministration doesn’t like it either. Federal transportation officials once heralded road diets for cutting crashes by 19% to 47%, but criteria for an upcoming round ofroad safety grantssay projects aimed at “reducing lane capacity” should be considered “less favorably,” the administration said. Forcing travelers into more constrained spaces “can lead to crashes, erratic maneuvers, and a false sense of security that puts everyone at risk,” the U.S. Department of Transportation said in an email statement to The Associated Press. “The update reflects the Department’s concerns about the safety hazards associated with congestion.”  Kansas City saved some money when it converted 31st Street in 2022 because a gas line was going in anyway. It reopened with one lane in each direction instead of two, a shared turn lane near the signalized intersections, betterpedestrian crossingsand protected on-street parking spaces. Road diets are now an almost automatic part of the process in Kansas City whenever a street is up for repaving. For years,federal guidelinessaid lane reductions were usually appropriate on roads carrying fewer than 25,000 vehicles a day. Most of the city’s four-lane roads don’t meet that threshold. Bobby Evans, an urban planner at the Mid-America Regional Council who has worked on Kansas City’s road diets, calls the strategy “a smashing success” and one of the most effective tools at reducing speed, crashes and injuries. “In the architectural world you’d call it environmental determinism,” Evans said. “You want to make it so they don’t feel comfortable going too fast. You’re really not slowing them down. You’re bringing them back to the speed limit.” Numerous other cities have credited road diets with improving safety. Philadelphia cited a 19% drop in injury crashes. Portland, Oregon, saw a more than 70% decline in vehicles traveling at least 10 mph (16 kph) over the speed limit. The average speed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, fell by 5 mph (8 kph) on some roads within months. But Jay Beeber, executive director for policy at the National Motorists Association, an advocacy organization for drivers, said most road diets represent an ill-advised effort to force vehicles off the road. The number of vehicles may decline on dieted roads, but then surrounding roads have to absorb the traffic, he said. “Those cars have to go somewhere,” he said. “Cars are like water. They seek their own level.” Leah Shahum, who directs the Vision Zero Network, a nonprofit advocating for street safety, said road diets are inexpensive and supported by years of research. Cities in Republican-led states are among the converts and Shahum isn’t sure if the Trump administration’s new guidance will make them reconsider. “I certainly hope that does not bleed over into indirectly discouraging communities from using this proven safety countermeasure,” Shahum said. “That would be a real loss.” Trump’s transportation department cited delivery and emergency vehicles among its concerns. When University of Iowa researchers surveyed first-responders in Cedar Rapids, their study published last year found no noticeable difference in response time when a road diet was in place. There was, however, a perceived need to educate drivers about what to do when an ambulance uses a center turn lane to pass. Cara Hamann, an associate professor of epidemiology who co-authored the study, said she recalled no major examples of EMS or fire trucks being unable to get through. “The road diet didn’t cause a level of congestion that slowed them down,” she said. Even before Trump, skepticism was growing in some red states. San Antonio spent years planning to repurpose a formerly state-owned portion of its Broadway Street by removing vehicle lanes and improving a stretch for bikes and pedestrians. But Texas abruptly reclaimed the road in 2022 and nixed the project as GOP Gov. Greg Abbott ran for reelection and called for an end to anti-car policies. “They basically used Broadway as a political football,” said Bryan Martin, owner of Bronko Bikes, an electric bike repair shop. Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill last year calling for a 180-day review period and several other steps before a local government can eliminate a lane. He said it would prevent activists from intentionally clogging roads to slow vehicles. Not all the pushback has come from Republican-led states. During the pandemic, Culver City, California, implemented a road diet to prioritize walking, biking and transit. But when cars returned and traffic backed up for miles, the city reversed the plan. Some residents sued in Vancouver, Washington, saying the city should have put its road diets up for a public vote. “I’ve seen people passing in the shoulder or the bike lane,” said Justin Wood, one of the opponents. “It creates more opportunity for conflict.” Evans, the planner in Kansas City, said road diets can’t stop all reckless drivers. “If you are bound and determined to go 12 miles over the speed limit on a three-lane road, you’re going to have to engage in some stupid, dangerous driving,” Evans said.",Economy,1
"60,000 Americans to lose their rental assistance and risk eviction unless Congress acts",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2185,AP News,Jesse Bedayn,21-04-25,"Moments after Daniris Espinal walked into her new apartment in Brooklyn, she prayed. In ensuing nights, she would awaken and touch the walls for reassurance — finding in them a relief that turned to tears over her morning coffee. Those walls were possible through a federal program that pays rent for some 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. Espinal was fleeing both. But the program, Emergency Housing Vouchers, is running out of money — and quickly. Funding is expected to be used up by the end of next year, according to a letter from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and obtained by The Associated Press. That would leave tens of thousands across the country scrambling to pay their rent. It would be among the largest one-time losses of rental assistance in the U.S., analysts say, and the ensuing evictions could churn these people — after several years of rebuilding their lives — back onto the street or back into abusive relationships. “To have it stop would completely upend all the progress that they’ve made,” said Sonya Acosta, policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which researches housing assistance. “And then you multiply that by 59,000 households,” she said.  The program, launched in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden as part of the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, was allocated $5 billion to help pull people out of homelessness, domestic violence and human trafficking.  People from San Francisco to Dallas to Tallahassee, Florida, were enrolled — among them children, seniors and veterans — with the expectation that funding would last until the end of the decade. But with the ballooning cost of rent, that $5 billion will end far faster. Last month, HUD sent letters to groups dispersing the money, advising them to “manage your EHV program with the expectation that no additional funding from HUD will be forthcoming.” The program’s future rests with Congress, which could decide to add money as it crafts the federal budget. But it’s a relatively expensive prospect at a time when Republicans, who control Congress, are dead set on cutting federal spending to afford tax cuts. Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who championed the program four years ago, is pushing for another $8 billion infusion. But the organizations lobbying Republican and Democratic lawmakers to re-up the funding told the AP they aren’t optimistic. Four GOP lawmakers who oversee the budget negotiations did not respond to AP requests for comment. “We’ve been told it’s very much going to be an uphill fight,” said Kim Johnson, the public policy manager at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)  Espinal and her two daughters, aged 4 and 19, are living on one of those vouchers in a three-bedroom apartment with an over $3,000 monthly rent — an amount extremely difficult to cover without the voucher. Four years ago, Espinal fought her way out of a marriage where her husband controlled her decisions, from seeing her family and friends to leaving the apartment to go shopping. When she spoke up, her husband said she was wrong, or in the wrong or crazy. Isolated and in the haze of postpartum depression, she didn’t know what to believe. “Every day, little by little, I started to feel not like myself,” she said. “It felt like my mind wasn’t mine.” When notices arrived in March 2021 seeking about $12,000 in back rent, it was a shock. Espinal had quit her job at her husband’s urging and he had promised to cover family expenses. Police reports documenting her husband’s bursts of anger were enough for a judge to give her custody of their daughter in 2022, Espinal said. But her future was precarious: She was alone, owed thousands of dollars in back rent and had no income to pay it or support her newborn and teenage daughters. Financial aid to prevent evictions during the pandemic kept Espinal afloat, paying her back rent and keeping the family out of shelters. But it had an expiration date. Around that time, the Emergency Housing Vouchers program was rolled out, targeting people in Espinal’s situation.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew)  A “leading cause of family homelessness is domestic violence” in New York City, said Gina Cappuccitti, director of housing access and stability services at New Destiny Housing, a nonprofit that has connected 700 domestic violence survivors to the voucher program. Espinal was one of those 700, and moved into her Brooklyn apartment in 2023. The relief went beyond finding a secure place to live, she said. “I gained my worth, my sense of peace, and I was able to rebuild my identity.” Now, she said, she’s putting aside money in case of the worst. Because, “that’s my fear, losing control of everything that I’ve worked so hard for.” ___ Bedayn is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.Report for Americais a nonprofit national service program that places journalists in local newsrooms to report on undercovered issues.",Economy,1
Drones pose increasing risk to airliners near major US airports,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2186,AP News,Aaron Kessler,21-04-25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A commercial airliner was on final approach to San Francisco’s international airport in November when the crew spotted a drone outside the cockpit window. By then it was too late “to take evasive action,” the pilots reported, and the quadcopter passed by their windshield, not 300 feet away. A month earlier, a jetliner was flying at an altitude of 4,000 feet near Miami’s international airport when its pilots reported a “close encounter” with a drone. In August, a drone came within 50 feet of clipping the left wing of a passenger jet as it departed Newark International Airport. The incidents were all classified as “near midair collisions” — any one of which could have had catastrophic consequences, according to aviation safety experts. They were also not isolated encounters. An Associated Press analysis of anaviation safety databasereveals that drones last year accounted for nearly two-thirds of reported near midair collisions involving commercial passenger planes taking off and landing at the country’s top 30 busiest airports. That was the highest percentage of such near misses since 2020, when air traffic dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first reports of near misses involving drones were logged in 2014, the AP found. The number of such encounters spiked the following year. Over the last decade, drones accounted for 51% — 122 of 240 — of reported near misses, according to AP’s analysis. Passenger jets have long been subject to risks around airports — whether from bird strikes or congested airspace — as was made clear by theJanuary collisionbetween a military helicopter and commercial jet near Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people. The threat from drones has become more acute in the last decade as the use of quadcopters and remote-controlled planes has exploded in popularity. TheFAA estimatesthat Americans are operating more than a million drones for recreational and commercial purposes. “If you have the money, you can go on the internet and buy a pretty sophisticated drone that can reach altitudes they really have no business being at,” said William Waldock, a professor of safety science atEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The risk is most acute near airports because that is where the flight paths of drones and airplanes most overlap, experts said. The incidents represent only a portion of such close calls because thedatabase— NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System — relies on voluntary submissions from pilots and other aviation workers. A separate FAAprogram, which includes reports from the public, tallied at least 160 sightings last month of drones flying near airports. “The FAA recognizes that urgency, and we all know additional changes need to be made to allow the airports to go out and detect and mitigate where necessary,” said Hannah Thach, executive director of thepartnership, known as Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence.

The FAA said it has taken steps to mitigate the risks of drones. It has prohibited nearly all drones from flying near airports without prior authorization, though such rules are difficult to enforce, and recreational users may not be aware of restrictions. The agency requiresregistrationsfor drones weighing more than 250 grams (0.55 pounds), and such drones are required to carry a radiotransponderthat identifies the drone’s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Additional rules govern commercial drone use. The agency has also beentesting systems to detect and counterdrones near airports. Among the methods being examined: Using radio signals to jam drones or force them to land. Authorities are also weighing whether to deploy high-powered microwaves or laser beams to disable the machines. Experts said the FAA and other authorities could do more. They suggested creating a system similar to speed cameras on roadways that could capture a drone’s transponder code and send its pilots a ticket in the mail. They also said the FAA should consider regulations that require all manufacturers to program a drone’s GPS unit to prevent it from flying near airports and other sensitive areas, a method called “geofencing.” DJI, a leading drone maker, used such geofencing restrictions for years. However, iteliminated the featurein January, replacing it with an alert to drone pilots when they approach restricted areas. Adam Welsh, head of global policy at DJI, said managing requests from authorized users to temporarily disable the geofencing became an increasingly time-consuming task. More than one million such requests were processed last year. “We had around-the-clock service, but the number of applications coming in were becoming really hard to handle,” Welsh said. “They all had to be reviewed individually.” With no other manufacturers enabling geofencing, and without government rules requiring it, DJI decided to end the practice, he said. The FAA declined to say if it is considering whether to mandate geofencing. Experts said authorities should take more aggressive action to hold drone users accountable for violating restricted airspace — to highlight the problem and deter others from breaking the rules, pointing to recent arrests that they hoped might send such a message. In December, for example, Boston policearrested two menwho operated a drone that flew dangerously close to Logan International Airport. Police reported that they were able to find the drone flyers, in part, by tracking the aircraft thanks to its FAA-mandated transponder signal. A month later, a small drone collided with a “Super Scooper” plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane’s left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs. Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man, who has yet to be sentenced,admitted he launched his DJI quadcopterto observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that’s when it struck the “Super Scooper.” ___ Contact AP’s global investigative team at[email protected]orhttps://www.ap.org/tips/",Economy,1
This Midwestern city has long been a federal hub. The pain from DOGE’s cuts is everywhere,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2187,AP News,Ryan J. Foley,20-04-25,"KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided day care for the children of U.S. soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs. Public service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion. But when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: Her entire office had been let go in thelatest mass firingordered by President Donald Trump’s administration. The 46-year-old single mom has canceled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at theAdministration for Children and Families, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  “Not only me, but all these peoples’ lives are turned upside down,” Giagnorio said. The impact of the cuts by Trump appointees andElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiencycan be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1,000 miles away from Washington, D.C. Money once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy. With nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said he believes the region could lose 6,000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.  An IRS worker said thousands of her coworkers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this week to retire early or take a buyout. A U.S. Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically Black neighborhood’s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded. The withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic. A landlord may have to sell an office building for a loss after his federal tenants were among several that abruptly canceled local leases, adding a glut of real estate to the market. And the city’s Tesla showroom has become a spot of weekly protest. Activists are seeking to have it closed by pushing a referendum intended to drive Musk’s electric car company out of Missouri. Shea Giagnorio, left, talks to a recruiter at a job fair on the day she was laid off from her job at the Administration for Children and Families, Tuesday, April 1, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The nation’s health department is slashing its full-time national workforce from 82,000 to 62,000. Among them were Giagnorio and her colleagues in her agency’s 10 regional offices around the country that helped deliver services through programs such as Head Start and emergency assistance for low-income families. “The poor will become even more poor now,” Giagnorio said. “If we’re taking away social safety nets, what is the end result? If we’re not helping homeless people anymore, will they freeze to death in the winter? Is that what we want?”  Giagnorio, who spent most of her career as a U.S. Department of Defense civilian employee at bases in Germany and Alaska, is on paid leave until her June 2 termination. She wasted no time looking for another position after being locked out of her office, visiting a job fair hours later that Kansas City hosted for displaced federal workers. But she doubts she will be able to find a public sector salary anywhere near the $117,000 she made and doesn’t know how her skills translate to the private sector. She worries about losing the health insurance that covers her family and having to pull her daughter out of Maastricht University in the Netherlands after her first year. For now, she can’t get any answers from the agency to basic questions about her financial future. Does she still qualify for an early retirement buyout offer that had been extended? How much would she receive and when? IRS customer service representative Shannon Ellis, stands outside a processing center where hundreds of her colleagues have taken buyouts and others face potential layoffs, Monday, April 14, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The days leading up to the April 15 tax filing deadline were always going to be busy for workers at the IRS processing center near Union Station, but this year, they were particularly stressful. The IRS is considering a downsizing that could cut as many as 20,000 employees, or 25% of its workforce, in the coming weeks. The roughly 6,000 employees in Kansas City faced agonizing choices: decide whether to accept resignation or early retirement offers by April 14 or risk losing their jobs later. “It’s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what’s required of them,” said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.  By Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week. Their building has been overcrowded since the IRS ordered remote employees back to the office in March. Workers sometimes struggle to find open desks. Some have to bring their own ink pens and share date stamps to perform basic job functions after budget cuts have depleted supplies. Ellis said IRS workers share the public’s disdain for taxes but understand that collecting them is necessary to support important programs like Social Security. She said she’s decided to take a “roll of the dice” and stay in her job, spurning an early retirement offer. “I love my job,” she said. “I’m not going to let the bully force me out.” Volunteers weed garden plots in preparation for planting vegetables at the Ivanhoe neighborhood community garden, Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  Urban farmer Rosie Warren grew 2,500 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighborhood, where many Black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century. Warren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighborhood council a three-year, $130,000 grant to expand the gardens and farmers’ market serving the area.  Plans called for hiring an assistant to help Warren with growing more food and to add another market day aimed at serving more low-income older adults, mothers and children. In February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award “no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.” A client picks up staples at the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, Tuesday, April 15, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  On a recent morning, Warren took a break from preparing the soil for planting to ponder the USDA’s decision. “What do you do if you don’t support providing access to food to people who don’t have it? Wouldn’t this make your job easier?” she said. “I think it’s absurd. It doesn’t make any sense.” Other food aid in the neighborhood has taken a hit at a time when demand is rising. At the Bishop Sullivan Center food pantry, hundreds of low-income families are getting fewer groceries in their monthly pickups after USDA halted $500 million worth of deliveries to food banks. That included a planned order for 41,000 cases of meat, dairy and other commodities to a bank serving Kansas City. “It just means giving families less food,” said pantry director Christopher Lowrance, who said he’s able to provide less chicken and other meat products. “It’s as simple as that.” Laboratory technician Asfaw Ayana examines a sample at the Kansas City Department of Public Health, Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  The Kansas City Health Department’s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s. One basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times. Kansas City’s health director, Dr. Marvia Jones, made it a top priority to modernize the labs this year after studying their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Her agency planned to use federal funding to purchase new microscopes and testing equipment.  “That early disease detection allows you to do more rapid intervention, more rapid treatment, more rapid isolation,” she said. But the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration’s $11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health. That news “crushed” the department’s carefully laid plans, Jones said. Jones said the cuts, $3 million and counting for her department, mean the city will also have fewer vaccines to administer to low-income residents. “It would be a sad shame for us to be in a worse position than we were before the pandemic,” she said. “We had processed all of our lessons learned, and then now this happens.” Amir Minoofar was surprised when two federal agencies notified him that they planned to vacate the office building he’s owned for a decade in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. Minoofar said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had recently agreed to extend its lease until 2029. The National Labor Relations Board, meanwhile, was paying month to month. Minoofar said the government initially notified him the agencies would be out of the building in August, part of a DOGE-led blitz ofhundreds of lease cancellationsthat has been marked by errors and subsequent reversals.  In the Kansas City metropolitan area, the government is moving to cancel 10 leases totaling 219,000 square feet that cost more than $4 million in annual rent, according to DOGE’s online “Wall of Receipts.” Minoofar said he was more recently told the agencies will likely have to stay past August and their departure date is now unclear. He said he may have to sell the building, which has an appraised value of $2.9 million, and take a loss because of the difficult office market. But he said he understands why the government would unload the space, which he said has often been sparsely used since the rise of telework during the pandemic. “Businesswise, it makes sense for government to cut costs,” he said. “A lot of people are going to be unhappy but it’s a huge gigantic family and they need to take care of it. You cannot keep everybody happy.” Demonstrators protest against Elon Musk and Department of Government Efficiency cuts outside a Tesla dealership, Saturday, April 12, 2025, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  With liberal anger growing at Musk’s role in the government, protesters have gathered Saturdays outside his Tesla dealership in Kansas City to denounce the cuts. State records show Tesla sales there have dropped amid calls for a boycott. Now, enough voter anger could even force the business to close. Organizers of a newly launched “Unplug Musk” initiative are seeking to use democracy to strike at the world’s richest man by changing state law to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to consumers.  They say they plan to soon begin gathering the 111,000 signatures of registered voters that they would need to put the change on the statewide ballot in November 2026. If approved by voters, it would force the closure of the Tesla showrooms in Kansas City and St. Louis. Missouri’s governor, Republican Mike Kehoe, a former auto dealer himself, sponsored a 2014 bill when he was a state senator aimed at requiring manufacturers like Tesla to sell through local dealers. The bill passed the Senate but died in the House after Tesla lobbied against it. The referendum revives that plan. “There’s not a soul in this country who’s against trying to weed out government inefficiency but just taking a chain saw to people’s lives and their health care is a ridiculous way to achieve that. And it is going to cause some devastating impacts,” said organizer Brad Ketcher, a prominent Democrat and lawyer who helped draft the state’s 2022 marijuana legalization referendum. An HHS spokesperson said the agency’s downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organization more efficient. As for the $11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, “HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.” The IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public. Musk said last year that Trump’s budget cuts would cause a “temporary hardship” that would soon put the economy on stronger footing. One local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship will be in Kansas City, including whether it will just slow growth or cause population losses. “It’s a big burden that’s being placed on a narrow group of people,” said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a nonprofit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. “It will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.” Trump has credited DOGE with helping end “the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,” saving billions to help improve the nation’s finances. The White House didn’t respond to questions about Kansas City. But Trump said recently he would invite the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House to make up for a 2020 Super Bowl victory celebration that was canceled during the pandemic. __ Associated Press writer Heather Hollingsworth contributed to this report.",Economy,1
More pharmacies offer to speed prescription deliveries to customers,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2188,AP News,Tom Murphy,20-04-25,"America’s two largest retailers want to deliver prescriptions to your doorstep in as little as a few hours. Amazon and Walmart are undergoing national expansions in same-day prescription deliveries. They’re joininga trendthat has gained momentum since the COVID-19 pandemic, with drugstore chains and companies like Instacart and DoorDash rushing to deliver prescriptions as soon as possible. Fast prescription delivery options are growing astraditional drugstores closeandmore people use telemedicineorsubscription-based carethat encourages regular deliveries. But this trend may run into limits in the complicated U.S. health care system, where drug costs and coverage can outweigh convenience for consumers, some of whom still like visiting a store. “It takes a lot to change people’s behavior when it comes to their health care,” said Arielle Trzcinski, a principal analyst with the consulting firm Forrester. Independent drugstores have done same-day deliveries for years, especially for patients who are homebound or recovering from surgeries, said Brigid Groves, a vice president with the American Pharmacists Association. CVS Health started same-day deliveries in 2017 and has since expanded its reach. The chain delivered more than 4 million prescriptions through that service in 2023. Walgreens also does this nationally and offers a service at hundreds of locations that will deliver within two hours. Instacart got into prescription deliveries during the COVID-19 pandemic when it started a partnership with Costco. The grocery delivery company has since launched same-day delivery partnerships with Wegmans and Publix. Amazon expects to offer same-day prescription deliveries to nearly half of its U.S. customers by the end of this year. It’s adding 20 small pharmacies to distribution centers around the country to improve delivery speeds. Separately, the company also has opened 10 prescription processing centers in the past few years. It can do same-day deliveries from those as well. “We’re building a modern pharmacy, what we like to think of as a pharmacy in your pocket,” Amazon executive Hannah McClellan said at a company presentation last fall. The Amazon Pharmacy vice president added that this included rapid deliveries and around-the-clock access to pharmacists. Walmart launched same-day deliveries last fall in six states and expanded earlier this year to every state except North Dakota, where it has no pharmacies. The company allows customers to get their medicines along with groceries or other store items. It offers several levels of service, including some deliveries in a half hour. Customer demand drove Walmart’s expansion, said Kevin Host, a pharmacy senior vice president. He said prescription deliveries were the top thing customers requested when surveyed by the company. Host noted that most people pick a pharmacy based on how close it is to their home or whether it has a drive-through window. “This is just elevating that level of convenience,” he said. Same-day deliveries can help people get started quicker on antibiotics or COVID-19 treatments when they are sick and see a doctor via telemedicine. McClellan also said that customers who get their prescriptions quickly are more likely to take them. She said Amazon was doubling down on same-day deliveries this year and has “big plans to continue to build and scale those capabilities in the years to come.” Patients may like convenience, but they like saving money even more. Same-day deliveries can come with additional fees. People who consider them will want to know whether they are getting a better deal on their medicines, Trczinski said. She noted that this is especially true with so-called maintenance prescriptions that are refilled repeatedly. People with insurance who are taking those maintenance drugs may already have them delivered, noted Andrew Mulcahy, a senior health economist with the nonprofit research organization RAND Corp. “The practical implications of these kinds of programs will be very muted,” he said. Customers also will have to trust that their regular prescriptions get delivered on time and are covered by their health insurer, especially if they switch pharmacies for deliveries. Some pharmacy benefit managers limit coverage outside certain pharmacies. Drugstore pharmacists also have started providing more care and working with customers to manage conditions like high blood pressure. These things give people more reasons to visit a store. Plus, some people just prefer going to drugstores. Don Watson says he might consider prescription deliveries “maybe 10 years from now when I’m not able to do it myself.” The 72-year-old Indianapolis resident said as he left a Walgreens store recently that he has no problem picking up prescriptions. “Sometimes the wait can be a little long … that’s my only gripe,” he said. ___ Haleluya Hadero contributed to this report. ____ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Strollers and other baby products will get more expensive – and harder to find – with tariffs,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2189,AP News,Dee-Ann Durbin,20-04-25,"Sam Rutledge and his wife havea baby duein mid-July, so they thought they had a few more months to research and buy the gear they’ll need. But President Donald Trump’stariff announcementin early April turned the couple’s slow walk intoa sprint. In the past few weeks, they’ve bought two strollers, a car seat, a nursery glider, a crib and a high chair. All of them are made overseas. “These are all pretty expensive under normal conditions, but when it became clear tariffs were coming we decided to buy them in case they became prohibitively expensive,” said Rutledge, who is a high school physics teacher. Raising a child in America has never been cheap. In the first year alone, it costs an average of $20,384, according to Baby Center, a parenting website. But tariffs – ranging from 10% for imports from most countries to 145% forimports from China-- will make it many times more expensivefor new parents. An estimated 90% of the core baby care products and the parts that go into makingbaby paraphernalia– from bottles and diaper pails to strollers andcar seats– aremade in Asia, according to the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, a U.S. trade group. The vast majority come from China. “Overseas manufacturing has been the norm in our industry for decades,” said Lisa Trofe, the association’s executive director.

(AP Photo/Nathan Howard)   Earrings manufactured in China are displayed for sale at the baby store Three Littles’ Union Market location in Washington, on Wednesday, April 16, 2025. (AP Photo/Nathan Howard)  It wasn’t always this way. When Munchkin Inc. CEO Steven Dunn founded his company in 1991, it made baby bottles in California with tooling from New Jersey. But over the years, the manufacturers he used shut down and the cost of doing business in the U.S. skyrocketed. Now, about 60% of Munchkin’s 500 products, from a $5 sippy cup to a $254 Night Owl Stroller with headlights, are made in China. In response tothe tariffs, Dunn halted orders from China and instituted a hiring freeze at Munchkin’s California headquarters, where 320 people are employed. Dunn expects Munchkin will run out of some products within three months. “There is no possibility of being able to pass on those tariffs” to customers in the form ofprice increases, he said. Dunn said he tried to reduce his dependence on China in recent years, shifting some manufacturing to Vietnam and Mexico. He also spent a year communicating with American manufacturers to see if one could make Munchkin’s new Flow Nipple Shield, which allowsa breastfeeding motherto see if her milk is flowing. But most said they couldn’t make the complex silicone product, Dunn said. It’s now made in Vietnam. “There’s not enough tool makers and manufacturing expertise and automation and skilled labor in the U.S. to make the thousands of products the juvenile industry needs,” Dunn said. Multiple baby brands and companies contacted by The Associated Press didn’t respond or said they weren’t commenting on the tariffs, including Graco, Chicco, Britax, Nuna, Dorel Juvenile, UppaBaby, Evenflo and Bugaboo. The Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association said it asked the Trump administration fora tariff exemption, arguing that baby products are essential for children’s well-being. Trump exempted some baby products, including car seats and high chairs, from import taxes during his first administration. But he hasn’t said whether he would consider doing so again. The Associated Press left a message seeking comment with the White House. Nurture&, a company that makes a popular nursery glider and other baby furniture, said it’s trying to be transparent about the impact of tariffs. In a recent email, the company told customers it started lowering prices on some items when the tariffs hit. The company, which was founded in 2020, said it would keep those lower prices in place until April 30, but after that it may not be able toabsorb the full costof the import duties. “These are large purchases, these are investments, and this is a very sensitive life stage,” Nurture& Chief Merchant Jill Gruys said. “We want people to make the best decision for their budget and their family.” Elizabeth Mahon, the owner of Three Littles, a baby store in Washington, said she’s worried the tariffs will make essential products too expensive for some families. Mahon volunteers twice per month at the Department of Motor Vehicles, where she teaches people how to buckle their kids safely into car seats. Some families still must be persuaded to use car seats, she said. Mahon fears higher prices would be another deterrent. “No one is dying if they can’t buy a toy, but if they don’t have access to car seats, kids will get seriously injured,” she said.

(AP Photo/Nathan Howard)  At her own store, Mahon is getting notices that some manufacturers plan to introduce steep price increases in May. She feels lucky she could rent a storage facility and build up inventory ahead of the tariffs. For many small businesses, she said, the extra costs are “a death sentence.” At The Little Seedling baby shop in Ann Arbor, Michigan, owner Molly Ging said she would normally be putting in Christmas orders at this time of year. Instead, she’s sorting through price increase notices from many of the vendors she works with. “It’s a lot to manage, and I just have no idea how it’s going to play out,” she said. Business is brisk right now, with customers hoping to beat tariff-related price increases. But Ging worries about her 13 employees – all moms who bring their kids to work – and about whether she can maintain enough inventory to meet future demand. “Babies don’t stop being born because there’s tariffs,” she said.",Economy,1
"15 years after Deepwater Horizon oil spill, lawsuits stall and restoration is incomplete",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2190,AP News,Jack Brook,21-04-25,"NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rigexploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (500 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation’s worst offshore oil spill are still being felt. Oil company BPpaid billions of dollars indamages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significantcompensation. Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.

They didn’t do what they should have to protect these young people.” Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has beenlinked to health problems. This photo provided by Tammy Gremillion shows Jennifer Lee Gremillion, a Louisiana resident involved in the clean-up of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, with her daughter in 2020. (Tammy Gremillion via AP)  In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can becaused by exposure to oil. Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter’s death, is “1,000% confident” that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer. She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion’s suit is one of a small number of cases still pending. Aninvestigationby The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed andonly one has been settled. In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation. Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court. BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs. The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until “it would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.” Oyster beds suffocated, reefs were blanketed in chemicals and the fishing industry tanked. Pelicans diving for dead fish emerged from the contaminated waters smeared in a black sheen. Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A small dead fish floats on a pool of oil at Bay Long, off the coast of Louisiana, on June 6, 2010. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)  Since then, “significant progress” has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP. The council says more than 300 restoration projects worth $5.38 billion have been approved in the Gulf of Mexico, which PresidentDonald Trumprenamed theGulf of America. The projects include acquiring wetlands in Mississippi to protect nesting areas for birds, rebuilding reefs along Pensacola Bay in Florida and restoring around 4 square miles (11 square kilometers) of marsh in Lake Borgne near New Orleans. While a tragedy, the spill “galvanized a movement — one that continues to push for a healthier, more resilient coast,” said Simone Maloz, campaign director for Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a conservation coalition. A brown pelican covered in oil tries to raise its wings on the beach at East Grand Terre Island along the Louisiana coast on June 3, 2010. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)  The influx of billions of dollars in penalties paid by BP “allowed us to think bigger, act faster and rely on science to guide large-scale solutions,” she added. Yet what many conservationists see as the flagship of the restoration projects funded by the Deepwater Horizon disaster payout — an approximately $3 billion effort to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to rebuild 21 square miles (54 square kilometers) of land in southeast Louisiana — has stalled over concerns of its impact on the livelihoods of local communities and dolphin populations. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has said the project would“break our culture”by harming local oyster and shrimp fisheries due to the influx of freshwater. Earlier this month, his administration paused the project for 90 days, citing its high costs, and its future remains uncertain.

The company told the AP it has improved safety standards and oversight. “We remain keenly aware that we must always put safety first,” BP said in an emailed statement. “We have made many changes so that such an event should never happen again.” Still, Joseph Gordon, climate and energy director for the nonprofit Oceana, warned Deepwater Horizon’s legacy should be “an alarm bell” against the expansion of offshore drilling.

Vance and Modi are likely to discuss a potential US-India trade deal. Here’s what to know,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2191,AP News,Sheikh Saaliq,21-04-25,"NEW DELHI (AP) — U.S. Vice President JD Vance began a four-dayvisit to Indiaon Monday as the two countries seek to unlock economic opportunities and negotiate a bilateral trade deal. Vance will meet Prime MinisterNarendra Modiin New Delhi for talks on the economy, trade and geopolitical ties. Vance’s visit is seen as an important diplomatic mission by President Donald Trump’s administration, and it coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi’s main rival in the region. A trade deal between India and the U.S. could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties. The U.S. is also India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion until recently. India’s Foreign Ministry has said the visit will “provide an opportunity for both sides to review the progress in bilateral relations” and the two leaders will “exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.” Here’s what to know about Vance’s visit: Vance’s arrival in India comes weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was in India for ageopolitical conferenceand two months after Modi met Trump in Washington. Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. Duringhis visit, Modi hailed a “mega partnership” with the U.S. and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimize the possible fallout of Trump’s tariffs after it had already cut tariffs on a range of U.S. goods.  Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy as part of his now-paused tariff program, which has provided temporary relief for Indian exporters. During his visit, Modi sought to soften impending trade barriers by saying he was open to reducing more tariffs on U.S. goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military gear. The two countries also agreed to start talks toward clinching the bilateral trade agreement. Modi on Friday said he spoke with Elon Musk, noting that he and the SpaceX CEO “discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation,” adding “India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the U.S. in these domains.” India is a close partner of the U.S. for bilateral trade, foreign direct investments, defense cooperation and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region. It is also part of the Quad, which is made up of the United States, India, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China’s expansion in the region. Leading U.S. companies such as Apple Inc. and Google have expanded operations in India in recent years. Last month, Musk’s Starlinkentered into agreementswith two of India’s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services. To further boost trade ties, the U.S. and India have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 under the expected trade deal agreement. The negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in the agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry sectors. This poses a significant challenge for Modi’s government as it hopes to improve the country’s economy and generate jobs with an export-led recovery. Modi established a goodworking relationshipwith Trump during his first term in office. It now appears that the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries, particularly in trade. Chinese President Xi Jinping is aiming to position Beijing as a reliable trade partner in the Asia-Pacific region amid rising tensions with Washington. India has also already taken a number of steps to win over Trump. It will purchase more oil, energy and defense equipment, including the fifth-generation stealth fighter jets, from the U.S. The U.S., however, wants greater market access for its agricultural and dairy products in India, but New Delhi has been reluctant so far as the farm sector employs the bulk of the country’s workforce. Vance’s visit to India marks his first official trip to the country, which has added significance for the second family. His wifeUsha Vance— a practicing Hindu — is the daughter of immigrants from South India. In his memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” Vance described his wife as a “supersmart daughter of Indian immigrants” whom he met at Yale Law School. Usha’s parents moved to the U.S. in the late 1970s. Vance will be accompanied by Usha, their children and other senior members of the U.S. administration, and the couple will visit the Indian cities of Jaipur and Agra and participate in engagements at cultural sites, a readout from the White House said.",Economy,1
"U.S. small manufacturers hope to benefit from tariffs, but some worry about uncertainty",https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2192,AP News,Mae Anderson,19-04-25,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Drew Greenblatt is fully on board with theTrump administration’s use of tariffsto rebalance a global trading system that it says favors foreign companies over U.S. manufacturers. Greenblatt is the president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, Maryland, which makes baskets and racks for medical device manufacturers, aerospace companies, food processing companies and others. It has 115 employees and makes its products in three locations in Maryland, Indiana and Michigan. The steel is sourced from Tennessee, Illinois and Michigan. Currently, it’s hard to compete with baskets made overseas., Greenblatt says, because the countries he competes against have an “unfair advantage.” For example, due to European tariffs and taxes, it costs much more for a German consumer or company to buy Marlin wire baskets than it does for Americans to buy a German-made basket, creating an uneven playing field, Greenblatt said. “It’s wildly unfair to the American worker,” he said. “And this has, by the way, been going on for decades.” A crane lifts a container at the Port of Baltimore, Wednesday, April 9, 2025, in Baltimore. (AP Photo/Stephanie Scarbrough)  The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an “economic and national security” priority. U.S. manufacturing has been declining for decades. In June 1979, the number of manufacturing workers peaked at 19.6 million. By January of 2025, employment was down 35% to 12.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Small manufacturers, which make up 99% of all American manufacturing, have been hit particularly hard. The administration hasimplemented some tariffsagainst major U.S. trading partners, whileputting a hold on other tariffspending negotiations. The Trump administration says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, which will mean “better-paying American jobs,” for people making cars, appliances and other goods. Greenblatt agrees, saying he could double his staff if “parity” in tariffs becomes a reality. While other small manufacturing businesses also support the tariffs, other owners have concerns. The Trumptariffs threaten to upend the existing economic orderand possibly push the global economy into recession. And the uneven rollout of the policy has created uncertainty for businesses, financial markets and U.S. households. For Corry Blanc, the injection of uncertainty around the economy outstrips any potential benefit. He started his business, Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 2012. He makes handcrafted cookware such as skillets and other kitchenware and bakeware with American steel and wood and employs 12 staffers. He gets his steel from a plant in South Carolina and a distributor in Richmond. Wood comes from local regional sawmills near the company’s headquarters in Waynesboro, Virginia. He said he’s been fielding worried calls from customers in Canada and overseas. And he says the infrastructure isn’t in place to increase production if more people do start buying American-made goods. Blanc said he survived the pandemic and other tough times, but conditions now are the hardest they’ve ever been. “There’s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,” he said. Michael Lyons is the founder of Rogue Industries, a company that makes wallets and other leather goods in a workshop in Standish, Maine, with a staff of nine. He uses leather from Maine and the Midwest. About 80% of his products are made in Maine and 20% are imported. He said the uncertainty around the tariffs is outweighing any potential long-term benefit. A long-time customer from Canada recently told Lyons that he would no longer be buying from Rogue Industries because of the friction between the two countries. “Hopefully this will pass, and he’ll be able to come back,” he said. “But I did think that was kind of an interesting indicator for him to reach out.” Lyons would like to expand his business, but says, “at the time being, it’s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.” American Giant CEO Bayard Winthrop takes a more positive view. He founded his clothing company in 2011 after watching the textile industry go offshore, and seeing a lack of quality, affordable American-made clothing. He started by selling one sweatshirt, and now sells a wider range of clothing, mostly direct-to-consumer, but he also has a contract with Walmart. He sources cotton from Southeastern states like Georgia, Florida and North Carolina and has a factory in North Carolina and a joint partnership facility in Los Angeles. “People forget that in about 1985 that all the clothing that Americans bought was made in America,” he said. “It is only in the last 40 years that that we really pursued as a country a very aggressive approach to globalization.” In 1991, more than half of U.S. apparel, about 56%, was made in the U.S., according to statistics from the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2023 that number had shrunk to less than 4%. Winthrop hopes the tariffs will bring about a return to more American-made products. “The imbalances between our trading, in particularly with China, particularly the textiles, it’s just shocking, to be honest with you,” he said, adding that he hopes Trump’s policies “put domestic manufacturers on a bit more of a competitive footing.” Winthrop understands people’s concerns but said it’s important to think longer term. “Americans are worried about tariffs, and I think there’s a lot of justification for the worry because I think the administration can be volatile and unpredictable,” he said. But he added that people should put that aside. “The idea that we’re going to be more protective of our domestic marketplace and have an industrial policy that includes manufacturing jobs is, an old idea. It’s not a new idea,” he said.",Economy,1

The Hong Kong businessman set up this factory in mainland China in the 1990s, taking advantage of lower manufacturing costs. While the factory has soldiered through past economic turmoil, Lau said the escalating trade war has proved to be “most difficult.” “We didn’t expect that our orders would suffer so heavily,” Lau said.

After Trump returned to the White House this year, tariffs escalated further, with the U.S. imposing sweeping 145% tariffs and China raising its tariffs to 125%. For Lau’s aluminum-coating factory, he said it amounted to a 75% tariff on his products. One third of clients for Lau’s Kam Pin Industrial are from the U.S. One U.S. client said they would keep buying materials from Lau for an ongoing project because they couldn’t find another supplier, but they will need to reconsider whether to source from him for the next project. A few clients told him the chances of continuing business with him are slim. “Prospects are grim,” he said.

What to know about the tensions between Iran and the US before their second round of talks,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2194,AP News,Jon Gambrell,19-04-25,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) —Iranand the United States will hold talks Saturday in Rome, their second round of negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. The talks follow a first round held in Muscat, Oman, where the two sides spoke face to face. Trump has imposed new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign targeting the country. He has repeatedly suggested military action against Iran remained a possibility, while emphasizing he still believed a new deal could be reached by writing a letter to Iran’s 85-year-oldSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneito jump start these talks. Khamenei has warned Iran would respond to any attack with an attack of its own. Here’s what to know about the letter, Iran’s nuclear program and the tensions that have stalked relations between Tehran and Washington since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Trump dispatched the letter to Khamenei on March 5, thengave a television interview the next dayin which he acknowledged sending it. He said: “I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing.’” Since returning to the White House, the president has been pushing for talks while ratcheting up sanctions and suggesting a military strike by Israel or the U.S. could target Iranian nuclear sites. A previous letter from Trump during his first term drew an angry retort from the supreme leader. But Trump’s letters to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term led to face-to-face meetings, thoughno deals to limit Pyongyang’s atomic bombsand a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S. Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula,hosted the first round of talksbetween Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend. The two men met face to face after indirect talks and immediately agreed to this second round. Witkoff later made a television appearance in which he suggested 3.67% enrichment for Iran could be something the countries could agree on. But that’s exactly the terms set by the 2015 nuclear deal struck under U.S. President Barack Obama, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew America. Witkoff hours later issued a statement underlining something: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” Araghchi and Iranian officials have latched onto Witkoff’s comments in recent days as a sign that America was sending it mixed signals about the negotiations. Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officialsincreasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so. Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and to maintain a uranium stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran’s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity. U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.” Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, has warned in a televised interview thathis country has the capability to build nuclear weapons, but it is not pursuing it and has no problem with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspections. However, he said if the U.S. or Israel were to attack Iran over the issue, the country would have no choice but to move toward nuclear weapon development. “If you make a mistake regarding Iran’s nuclear issue, you will force Iran to take that path, because it must defend itself,” he said. Iran was once one of the U.S.’s top allies in the Mideast underShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. TheCIA had fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule. But in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule.The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran’s theocratic government. Later that year,university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed.The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980ssaw the U.S. back Saddam Hussein.The “Tanker War”during that conflict saw the U.S. launch a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea, whilethe U.S. later shot down an Iranian commercial airlinerthat the American military said it mistook for a warplane. Iran and the U.S. have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, with relations peaking when Tehran made the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. ButTrump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, sparking tensions in the Mideast that persist today. ___ Associated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage fromthe Carnegie Corporation of New YorkandOutrider Foundation.

Universal Epic Universe is the theme park resort’s biggest bang yet in Florida,https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/april-21-2195,AP News,Mike Schneider,19-04-25,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — From Harry Potter to Super Mario Bros. to Frankenstein’s monster, Universal Orlando Resort is pulling out all thepop culturestops at its newest and largesttheme park in Florida. With five distinctively-themed sections and a 500-room hotel, the multibillion-dollar Universal Epic Universe is slated to open to the public on May 22, just in time for the start of summer, when the Orlando area’s theme parks are usually jammed with families and young park-goers fresh out of school. It’s the first major, traditional theme park to open in Florida since 1999, when Universal Islands of Adventure debuted, though Universal opened a themed Orlando water park, Volcano Bay, in 2017. The addition of Epic Universe brings the total number of parks at the Florida resort to four, including Universal Studios. The opening also raises the stakes in Universal’s competition with crosstown rival Walt Disney World for a greater share of Orlando’s annual influx of 74 million tourists. Universal officials also describe Epic Universe as the company’s most technologically advanced theme park. For example, it uses a facial recognition system for ride express lines. Universal’s owner, Comcast NBCUniversal, also announced plans this month for itsfirst Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe, at a location north of London. A year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas should open later this year and a family-oriented theme park is slated to open next year in a Dallas suburb.  Epic Universe is making its big bang, with single-day tickets starting at $139 for adults and increasing to $199 during peak periods, just as the Trump administration stirs up economic uncertainty. U.S.tariff announcementsthreaten to limit the desire of some Americans to spend on vacations. And the rough treatment that someU.S. visitors have experiencedon arrival, as well asa boycott of the United Statesby some Canadians, are raising fears that international tourists will stay away. Tax receipts show Orlando’s tourist economy was booming last year, with Orange County collecting a record $359 million in tourist taxes. Here’s a look at Epic Universe’s different sections. Celestial Park is the hub in the spoke-like design of Epic Universe, connecting the other “worlds.” The astronomically-themed section is the only one with original characters not based on pre-existing intellectual property. Centered around a football field-sized water fountain and filled with abundant, colorful flowers, it’s an oasis of calm between the sensory overload of the four sections. That’s not to say excitement can’t be found in Celestial Park, which is home to a 133-foot (40.5-meter) high dual launching roller coaster, Stardust Racers, and an enormous carousel. Super Nintendo World is the definition of sensory overload, from its bright primary colors that scream “Look at me!” to the loudness of the steel-drum-thumping syncopated calypso music. It has two levels — rare for theme parks — and creates a completely immersive experience since nothing outside Super Nintendo World can be seen beyond the towering walls of Peach’s Castle and Mt. Beanpole. There is an augmented reality dark ride, a kid-friendly, slow-moving omni-mover ride and a Donkey Kong-themed coaster. Character performers dressed as Mario and Luigi greet members of the crowd in a roped-off area. Dark Universe is a throwback to Frankenstein’s monster, Dracula and the Invisible Man movies that launched Universal’s career in horror franchises. Visitors enter through a recreated central European village that has a storyline about vampires inhabiting the ground underneath. There is a dark ride through Frankenstein’s castle, a family-friendly coaster based on the werewolf legend and a tavern topped by a windmill with blades engulfed by flames every few minutes. This is the third installment of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions that turbocharged the Florida resort into a genuine challenger to Disney World’s dominance. The arched doorways, wrought-iron balconies and cobblestoned streets make visitors feel like they have parachuted into the Fantastic Beasts films set in 1920s Paris. The land’s highlight is the Battle at the Ministry’s omnidirectional lift ride, whose green-tiled, faux-gold-plated atrium is on a scale reminiscent of New York’s Grand Central Terminal. Next-generation animatronic dragons are the stars in this section, based on the “How to Train Your Dragon” franchise. Anchored by a lagoon at its center with Viking statues, the Viking-inspired land has a coaster, a boat ride and meet-and-greets with the surprisingly agile dragons, these aren’t your father’s animatronics. ___ Follow Mike Schneider on the social platform Bluesky at@mikeysid.bsky.social.",Economy,1
