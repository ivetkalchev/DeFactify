Flipkart to relocate HQ to India ahead of IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/flipkart-to-relocate-hq-to-india-ahead-of-ipo/,TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,21-04-25,"Flipkart, theWalmart-ownedIndian e-commerce startup that closely fights Amazon in the South Asian market, is preparing to shift its headquarters back to India from Singapore as the companyprepares to file for an IPOon Indian stock exchanges.

On Monday, Flipkart said the move “represents a natural evolution, aligning our holding structure with our core operations, the vast potential of the Indian economy.”

The e-commerce giant, which started its operations in 2007 in Bengaluru, moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2011 to attract more foreign investments, benefit from tax advantages, and better navigate bureaucratic hurdles and political challenges in India.

“As a company born and nurtured in India, this transition will further enhance our focus and agility in serving our customers, sellers, partners, and communities to continue contributing to the nation’s growing digital economy and entrepreneurship,” a Flipkart spokesperson said in a statement.

The relocation is subject to requisite approvals, the startup said, without disclosing a specific timeline. However, Flipkart is expected to file for an IPO in the country sometime next year.

In 2022, Walmart-backed PhonePe, which split from Flipkart in late 2022,moved its headquartersto India from Singapore. Several other startups, includingZeptoandGroww, have also relocated their headquarters to India in the last few months as they sought public listings on the Indian stock exchanges.

However, India’s current public market environment isnot as appealing as it had been up until late last year, as the market is going through some corrections and is impacted by macro conditions. IPOs made up around $19 billion of the record $70 billion equity deal volume reached in India last year, with 11 IPOs priced at above $500 million, per areportby Goldman Sachs.

Nonetheless, investors are optimistic about the growth potential in the Indian market, as several companies are waiting to go public this year and next.

“The supportive valuation environment has spurred issuer activity. A lot of the unicorns who were thinking of going public in the U.S. switched to India because they felt India supported a better valuation,” said Sudarshan Ramakrishnan, co-head of India investment banking at Goldman Sachs.

The latest move by Flipkart also comes almost a year afterraising $350 million from Googleas part of a nearly $1 billion funding round, which it kicked off in 2023. The startup was valued at $36 billion in the last investment.

"ChatGPT search is growing quickly in Europe, OpenAI data suggests",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/chatgpt-search-is-growing-quickly-in-europe-openai-data-suggests/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,21-04-25,"ChatGPT search, OpenAI’s feature withinChatGPTthat allows the chatbot to access and incorporate up-to-date information from the web into its responses, is growing at a fast clip in Europe.

A report filed by one of OpenAI’s EU corporate divisions, OpenAI Ireland Limited, reveals ChatGPT search had roughly 41.3 million average monthly active “recipients” for the six-month period ending March 31. That’sup from approximately 11.2 millionaverage monthly active recipients in the six-month period ending October 31, 2024.

OpenAI regularly publishes information on ChatGPT search to comply with the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which regulates many aspects of online services in European nations. The DSA defines monthly active recipients as “[people] actually engaging with the service at least once in a given period of time” by “being exposed to information disseminated on the online interface of the online platform, such as viewing it or listening to it, or by providing information.”

Interesting update in the OpenAI EU Digital Services Act (DSA) FAQ article

ChatGPT search had about 41.3 million average monthly active recipients in the European Union for the six-month period ending 31 March 2025

One component of the DSA instructs “very large” online platforms or search engines — those with over 45 million average monthly recipients — to allow users to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling, share certain data with researchers and authorities, and perform external auditing. ChatGPT search may soon be subject to these requirements, assuming the current growth trend holds.

Online platforms that don’t comply with the DSA’s rules could see fines of up to 6% of their global turnover. A platform continually refusing to comply could result in a temporary suspension in the EU.

ChatGPT Search has made inroads against incumbents like Google sincedebuting last year.According to a poll published in September, 8% of people said they’d choose ChatGPT over Google as their primary search engine. But Google remains far and away the dominant online search tool.By one estimate, it handles 373 times more searches than ChatGPT.

Researchers have found ChatGPT search and other AI-powered search engines to be less reliable than conventional search, depending on the query. According toone study, ChatGPT incorrectly identified 67% of searched-for articles.Another studysurfaced accuracy problems related to ChatGPT’s treatment of news content, including content from publishers with which OpenAI has licensing agreements.

Mark Zuckerberg once suggested spinning out Instagram as a solution to its ‘cannibalization’ of Facebook,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/mark-zuckerberg-once-suggested-spinning-out-instagram-as-a-solution-to-its-cannibalization-of-facebook/,TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,21-04-25,"In an internal email surfaced as part of theMeta antitrust trial,Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg fretted about the potential thatthe company’s Instagram acquisitionmay cannibalize Facebook. Were that to happen, it could lead to the “network collapse of the more engaging and profitable product,” a worried Zuckerberg told other Meta executives in a confidential message.

Zuckerberg proposed multiple ways to prevent this cannibalization from occurring, including building more bridges between Meta’s apps to make them function as a single network (suggesting that Instagram was contributing toFacebook’s loss of cultural relevance). He also openly wondered if Facebook would be better served by spinning out Instagram as a separate business.

In its trial against Meta, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is attempting to prove that the company is operating a social networking monopoly and that its acquisition of competing apps like Instagram and WhatsApp allowed it to maintain its dominant position in the market. As evidence, the prosecution is surfacing emails and other messages that indicate that Zuckerberg understood the threat Instagram posed to Facebook, even after it became a part of Meta’s larger family of apps.

In an email dated May 2018, Zuckerberg explained to other Facebook executives — including Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, now former COO Sheryl Sandberg, former CTO Mike Schroepfer, former Chief Growth Officer (now COO) Javier Olivan, and former CFO David Wehner — that he was concerned the company’s approach to its family of apps was not correct.

Specifically, Zuckerberg was worried that Instagram’s growth could hurt Facebook itself, saying that internal data shows that when users joined Instagram, their Facebook engagement “declines significantly.”

“We are starting to get more data that suggests this hollowing out of Facebook usage compounds as a larger percent of the population gets on Instagram,” Zuckerberg wrote in a section of the email titled “cannibalization and network collapse.”

The more the company pushed Instagram’s growth, the greater the threat Instagram posed to Facebook, Zuckerberg appeared to conclude.

“This raises the issue that our models for the future may be wrong,” Zuckerberg continued. “We currently expect both Facebook and Instagram to be able to grow, but it seems likely to be the case that if we promote Instagram to be around the same size as Facebook, that will have significant negative effects on Facebook that we are not currently modeling,” he wrote. “That is, the Facebook network can likely sustain decreased engagement among some of its members, but if engagement among its entire population is hollowed out, that may lead to significantly worse outcomes than we currently expect,” Zuckerberg said.

He also said that Instagram’s growth was mainly being driven by distribution from the Facebook app and its use of the Facebook friend graph.

“What this suggests is that while we hope to grow two products, there’s a real chance we may be causing network collapse of the more engaging and more profitable product to replace it with one that is less engaging and less profitable,” Zuckerberg said.

As a result, he said that Facebook was reducing its promotions to Instagram and that Instagram should introduce new integrations that would tip the balance back toward Facebook instead. He explained that he wanted bridges to be built between the two networks so the apps “increasingly function as a single network in more respects.”

As one example, Zuckerberg pointed out that it should be easier for video creators with large audiences to engage across both apps more easily. Plus, he wanted to combine the voice and video calling networks across WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram to become a single network. (Meta eventuallyintroducedcross-platform messaging in 2020, beforerolling it back years later.)

Notably, Zuckerberg also called out the difficulties of building new products and services within Instagram and WhatsApp because of “their founder leadership.”

He lamented that management couldn’t openly discuss its concerns about Instagram in particular, as it might demoralize the team and prevent the company from retaining Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.

He also pushed for the company to rethink its branding of products, so that Facebook’s brand remained front and center.

“When you open those apps, it would say ‘Instagram by Facebook’ and ‘WhatsApp by Facebook,’” Zuckerberg proposed in his email. “We may even need to put Facebook branding in the chrome of those apps where the app names and logos are today to cement this relationship in people’s minds.”

Zuckerberg pushed for Meta to rethink its branding so that Facebook remained front and center.

In 2021, Facebook insteadrebranded as Meta, whose logo now appears across all the company’s apps.

If the FTC wins its case, Meta may have to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp as separate businesses. Ironically, that’s something Zuckerberg himself suggested in his 2018 email as an alternative strategy — and possibly the “only structure” to accomplish the company’s goals. Spinning out Instagram could preserve Facebook’s growth, focus Meta’s teams, and allow the company to retain Systrom, wrote Zuckerberg. (Instagram’s founders left later that same year, in September 2018.)

Ultimately, Meta chose not to spin out its acquisitions. But Zuckerberg had warned the other execs in the email that there’s a “non-trivial chance” that Meta could be forced to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp in the next 5 to 10 years, making all its work building a family of apps “something we don’t get to keep.”

If the FTC succeeds in court, Zuckerberg will be proven right.

Meta downplayed the magnitude of these emails in a statement shared with TechCrunch.

“Out-of-context and years-old documents about acquisitions that were reviewed by the FTC more than a decade ago will not obscure the realities of the competition we face or overcome the FTC’s weak case,” a Meta spokesperson said.

Feds accuse Uber of charging customers for subscriptions without consent,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/feds-accuse-uber-of-charging-customers-for-subscriptions-without-consent/,TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,21-04-25,"The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit Monday against Uber, alleging the ride-hail and delivery giant charged customers for its Uber One subscription service without their consent. The lawsuit also claims Uber failed to deliver the savings promised in its subscription service and made it unreasonably difficult for users to cancel despite its “cancel anytime” promises.

Uber has denied any wrongdoing and accused the FTC of rushing the investigation process and basing its claims on “unvetted allegations.”

The lawsuit comes after the FTC has pushed companies with subscription services to make them easier to cancel under its previous director, Lina Khan. In October 2024, the agency finalized its “click to cancel” rule that requires companies to make canceling a subscription as easy as signing up for one. Despite facingsome challengesby industry groups, the rule is expected to go into effect May 14.

“Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. “The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people.”

The FTC’s complaint, which follows aninvestigationthat began last year, alleges that Uber customers are wrongly promised savings of $25 a month.

“Even if that were true, Uber does not account for the cost of the subscription (up to $9.99/month) when calculating those savings,” reads astatementfrom the FTC. “The company also obscures material information about the subscription (for example, by using small, greyed out text which consumers can easily miss).”

The complaint accuses Uber of automatically charging consumers who signed up for a free trial before their billing date. It also alleges that Uber makes it “extremely difficult” for customers to cancel, wherein users can be forced to navigate “as many as 23 screens and take as many as 32 actions to cancel.” Those actions come in the form of explaining why they want to cancel, dealing with Uber urging them to pause their membership, and if that fails, presenting offers to stay.

“Some users are told they have to contact customer support to cancel but are given no way to contact them; others claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they requested cancellation and were waiting to hear back from customer support,” reads the FTC’s statement.

Uber clarified that previously, customers who wanted to cancel within 48 hours of their sign up date had to contact customer support to cancel. The company says that is no longer the case. TechCrunch has reached out to learn when Uber updated its policy to allow those customers to cancel within the app.

The plaintiffs are pushing the court to prohibit Uber from continuing its alleged deceptive practices and to force the company to pay monetary relief.

“We are disappointed that the FTC chose to move forward with this action, but are confident that the courts will agree with what we already know: Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. “Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less.”

Tim Muris, a former FTC chair who represented Uber during the case’s investigation period, accused the FTC of failing to do a full investigation and basing its complaint on “misunderstandings of both the facts and the law.”

Uber’s current outside counsel, Christine Wilson, said, “The unconventional nature of the rushed investigative process that preceded this enforcement action was compounded by the addition of new and unvetted allegations at the last minute. It is disappointing to see the FTC stray from the rigor and fairness that has long defined the agency at its best.”

Uber One’s member base reached 30 million across 34 countries in 2024, and the company says it is growing roughly 60% year-over-year. A year ago, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi estimated that Uber One’s membership fees would be “in excess of $1 billion” in 2024.

Bezos-backed startup designed an EV that can change like a ‘Transformer’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/bezos-backed-startup-designed-an-ev-that-can-change-like-a-transformer/,TechCrunch,Sean O'Kane,21-04-25,"Jeff Bezos-backed Slate Auto has planted multiple concept versions of its EV on the streets of California. It’s a marketing tactic that teases the secretive startup’s strategy to sell a “Transformer”-like vehicle, people familiar with the company’s internal discussions told TechCrunch.

This unconventional real-world tease comes days before Slate’s April 24 launch event at Long Beach Airport, according to an invite viewed by TechCrunch.

The Michigan-based startup, founded in 2022, has operated in relative secrecy until TechCrunchpublished a report revealing Bezos’ financial involvement, as well as its plan to price its EV at around $25,000 while encouraging buyers to customize the vehicle to their liking. That base model is referred to as the “Blank Slate” version, according to atrademark applicationand another person familiar with the company’s plans. Slate has also filed for atrademarkfor the phrase: “We Built It. You Make It.”

The Autopian’s David Tracytraveledto Venice, California over the weekend where Slate parked a concept version of the truck made to look like a two-door SUV used by a fake business. Similarly, Reddit users posted pictures over the weekend ofyet anotherversion of the truckmade to look like a hatchback that almost resembles Rivian’sforthcoming R3.

The vehicle Tracy saw up close this past weekend looks just like the two-door pickup truck spotted by a Reddit userearlier this monthin Long Beach, but with a hard cover over the bed that gives it more of an SUV shape. The vehicle is covered in a wrap for a fake business called “Rockabye Rides,” which includes a URL that leads to a website that iscounting downto Slate’s event later this week.

That makes three different silhouettes we’ve seen of Slate’s truck so far — and that adaptability is something the company has privately touted as it locked down well over $100 million in funding, TechCrunch has learned.

Slate’s leadership focused heavily on the “Transformer” metaphor as it wooed investors to fill out its Series B funding round last year, according to a person familiar with the pitches. The company carefully choreographed the meetings around the idea, according to another person familiar with how they went.

This involved showing prospective investors a generic version of the truck, and then leading them to another room while a team quickly customized the vehicle. Then the prospective investors would be brought back to the first room only to find the truck looking completely different.

Those efforts appear to have been convincing. Guggenheim Partners CEO (and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers) Mark Walter seemingly invested in the round and joined Slate’s board, TechCrunch hasreported.

A spokesperson for the company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

These new photos give a pretty clear view of the exterior of Slate’s truck, and the potential level of customization. The interior remains a mystery, and there is no public knowledge about the vehicle’s specs.

The company has briefed a number of automotive journalists ahead of Thursday’s event, and Tracy wrote that he’s “under a strict NDA” on any of the sepecifics.

Even still, Tracy wrote that the Slate truck “is unlike any new vehicle I’ve ever seen not just in my decade as a car journalist, but in my entire lifetime.”

Tariff turmoil may have killed the tech M&A market’s comeback,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tariff-turmoil-may-have-killed-the-tech-ma-markets-comeback/,TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,21-04-25,"The tech market doesn’t need to be soaring up and to the right to foster healthy M&A activity. Deals can get done even in down markets. But can M&A thrive in an uncertain market? That’s a harder question.

The venture market soured in 2022 as fundraising and exits largely dried up. Since then, venture investors have been waiting in the wings for exits, both M&A and IPOs, to return. While the past few years didn’t deliver, heading into 2025, there was reason to be hopeful.

Late-stage startup valuations had started to recover, and a handful of strong deals gave the impression that a rebound might be underway. On top of that, the Trump administration painted itself as far more M&A-friendly than Joe Biden’s, which had previously blocked several high-profile deals on antitrust grounds.

Deals did start flowing at the beginning of 2025. According to PitchBook data, there were 205 U.S. startup acquisitions in the first quarter alone, and many of them were notable.

In March, CoreWeave agreed to pay$1.7 billion for Weights & Biases. The following week, ServiceNow announced its plans to acquire Moveworksfor $2.9 billion. And later that month, Google announced it was buyingcybersecurity startup Wizfor $32 billion.

Other first-quarter acquisitions included the sale of proptechDivvy Homesto the investment firm Brookfield for $1 billion and the sale ofNext Insuranceto Munich Re for $2.6 billion.

But then everything started to change in April.

On April 2 — dubbed “Liberation Day” — Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against nearly every major trading partner.Tech companies saw their stock plummetand Q1’s progress started to look like a blip.

A week later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on these tariffs, but the market now sits in a state of limbo.

“Heading into 2025 as you may recall, people were almost giddy, thinking things are really going to pick up in 2025,” Stellar Tucker, a managing director at Truist Securities, told TechCrunch. “I don’t think much of that has really materialized. The outlook right now is pretty tepid for 2025, which is unfortunate, because I think everyone went into 2025 thinking it was going to be a much better year than the past few that we’ve been suffering through.”

There are a few reasons why a volatile or uncertain public market can stall M&A activity.

For one, many of the most active acquirers — large public tech companies — are directly affected by the tariff uncertainty. Their stock prices have taken hits, and some of their core products or supply chains could face tariff impacts.

“The large public companies, they’re going to have a really tough time with depressed valuations in their stock,” said Kyle Stanford, the director of U.S. venture capital research at PitchBook, in an interview with TechCrunch. “Even if they have cash, they don’t want to put it to work in an uncertain market and kind of spook investors,” Stanford said. Added Stanford, stock buybacks are “probably something that they look at instead of company purchases.”

Another hurdle is price. For the past few years, uncertainty around valuations has lingered, with many late-stage startups no longer worth their frothy 2021 valuations. But what they are actually worth isn’t concrete either.

“There’s a lot of back-and-forth leading to significant uncertainty,” said Ronan Kennedy, who leads the capital advisory team for the investment firm B Capital. “Businesses don’t want to make a decision when waiting a few days could have led to a different decision” or valuation.

Despite the slowdown, some deals will get done.

Thomas Earnest, a partner at the law firm Mintz who focuses on tech fundraising and M&A, told TechCrunch that any company that has opportunistically put feelers out to sell this year is likely putting a pause on that effort. It’s a sharp contrast from what Earnest told TechCrunch just a few weeks back when he predicted an uptick in M&A.

“The world was a much different place in January than it was in March, and now we’re in a totally different place than we were three weeks ago,” Earnest said. “You’re not gonna go buy a house if you [fear] that in a week’s time it’s gonna be worth 20 or 30% [less] than what you paid for it, and I think that really could ring true in the M&A market.”

That said, not all M&A is driven by opportunity. Earnest said startups that are unable to raise their next round of funding will still need to pursue acquisitions, likely at lower valuations.

“They’ve probably been trying to hold out for the venture market to come back, and if it doesn’t, then those companies are gonna need to get comfortable with either down rounds or acquisitions at discounts,” Earnest said. “I think that you’ll see deal volume there.”

Well-capitalized AI companies that are private and pumped up with cash are likely to snap up smaller companies, too, Earnest added. Just one case in point: OpenAI, which just raised a$40 billion funding roundat the end of March, is rumored to be acquiring AI coding startupWindsurf for $3 billion.

As the second quarter unfolds, PitchBook’s Stanford fears that the events of the first few weeks of April could have already sidelined M&A activity for the rest of the year. He added that if these tariffs resume in early July — after the 90-day pause — or new trades deals are struck in the meantime, it may not matter much.

That stability likely wouldn’t come until the summer, a historically slow period for activity. Then comes fall, the fourth quarter, and the end-of-year holiday slowdown.

That leaves a tiny window for strong M&A deals to get done.

“I think the prospect of a stable 2025 seems pretty low at this point just because of the changes,” Stanford said. “We all know how much the news has changed in the past two weeks, what and how small or steep, who’s getting exceptions or what’s not getting exception. And [it] really creates a lot of uncertainty.”

PHNX Materials found a way to decarbonize concrete using dirty coal waste,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/phnx-materials-found-a-way-to-decarbonize-concrete-using-dirty-coal-waste/,TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,21-04-25,"Coal-fired power plants have done their fair share of damage over the past century. Fromclimate changetoacid rain,black lungtoheart disease, they’ve generally been on the debit side of the ledger.

But lurking in the literal ashes is something of a minor climate savior.

“Ash can be used to replace up to 30% of cement,” Krish Mehta, co-founder and CEO ofPHNX Materials, told TechCrunch. By displacing cement in concrete, fly ash fromcoal plantscan eliminate a significant chunk of the material’s carbon footprint.

PHNX Materials has devised a way to strip fly ash of sulfur and carbon, impurities that concrete companies would rather avoid. By drawing out those compounds, PHNX preps the fly ash so that it’s ready for concrete companies while also creating a new source of sulfur and aluminum, another compound found in fly ash.

The startup recently raised a $2.5 million seed round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The round was led by Divergent Capital, KdT Ventures, and Overture, with participation from Jane Woodward.

Ash has been used for millennia in concrete. Ancient Romans usedvolcanic ash, and over the past century or so, state transportation departments have turned to fly ash from coal plants. Caltrans, for example, requires a minimum 25% fly ash in concrete used for its projects.

Fly ash’s secret is that it helps to stabilize a concrete mix, said Jorge Osio-Norgaard, PHNX Materials co-founder and CTO. In the absence of ash, a certain chemical reaction can turn the aggregate — the small rocks in concrete — into a gel that can expand, cracking the concrete.

“When you spend a billion dollars on a highway or on a bridge, you want it to last the next 100 years,” Osio-Norgaard said. “Fly ash helps achieve that goal.”

The closure of coal-fired power plants has slashed the amount of ash available to concrete companies. Coal used to provide 51% of all electricity in the U.S.; today, it generates 15%.

Those closures have created a new industry in coal ash harvesting. Companies scour ash pits for quality fly ash, dig it up, do some light processing, and sell it to concrete companies. But not all the ash is up to spec, Mehta said, and that’s created a fly ash shortage that has caused prices to spike.

As a result, concrete companies have been dialing back the amount of fly ash in their mixes to around 8%, he said. They could be using up to 30%, but instead are making up the difference with additional cement, which costs nearly twice as much as fly ash per ton.

That trade not only risks the durability of the concrete, but it also increases its carbon footprint. Cement releases CO2from the chemical reaction that forms it and the fossil fuels that are used to provide heat to drive the reaction. One ton of cement produced in the U.S. releases about 0.8 tons of carbon dioxide,accordingto the EPA.

“We felt that unlocking a new supply of ash was the most scalable and quickest way to decarbonize the sector,” Mehta said.

PHNX’s process takes fly ash directly from landfills and extracts sulfur and aluminum. The company is also looking at ways to extract rare earth elements. It will then sell the ash to concrete makers and sulfur, aluminum, and other compounds to relevant industries. Sulfur, for example, can be used in fertilizer.

By addressing — and potentially profiting from — the impurities that lace the majority of the 843 fly ash landfills in the U.S., PHNX thinks it can offer the concrete industry a lower-carbon option. “We felt that unlocking a new supply of ash was the most scalable and quickest way to decarbonize the sector,” Mehta said.

Bluesky launches blue check verification,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/bluesky-launches-blue-check-verification/,TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,21-04-25,"Blueskyannounced on Mondaythat it is rolling out blue check verification, confirmingprevious rumorsthat this feature was on its way to the platform.

Like Twitter’s original blue check (RIP), Bluesky’s blue check will verify that notable accounts are legitimate, making it easy for users to trust that an account’s posts are real.

In its earliest phase, Bluesky will work with a select few “Trusted Verifiers,” which are independent organizations that can verify accounts as members of their team. For example, a company could verify members of its public relations team with blue checks, making it easier for users to see that these people can be trusted as sources of company news.

Bluesky says that its moderation team will verify each new verification to validate authenticity.

Bluesky already had a form of verification, letting any user set a domain they own as their username. For example, you’d know thatTechCrunch’s accountis real because it is verified withthe TechCrunch domain name, which an impersonator would not be able to access.

In the case of public figures like celebrities, journalists, and politicians, this additional layer of verification can help the platform cut down on disinformation from impersonators. According to Bluesky, 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to a website.

“Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky,” the Bluesky team wrote in a blog post. “At the same time, we’ve heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.”

At launch, Bluesky is not accepting applications for verification, but it said it plans to launch a request form in the future.

Speaking to TechCrunch, the student, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said they were notified via their college’s international student center that they’d been identified in a criminal records check. The student said that they’d been studying in the U.S. for nearly a decade starting as an undergraduate, and that they have no criminal record.

“The most likely cause may be an interaction with the police many years ago, even before I entered graduate school,” the student said. “I was conducting research in the AI field and had planned to continue my research after graduation.”

Over the past few months,more than a thousand international students in the U.S.have had their visa statuses challenged by the State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an aggressive crackdown orchestrated by the Trump administration. In many cases, colleges haven’t been directly notified by the relevant federal agencies, leaving students with little notice — or recourse.

Yisong Yue, a machine learning professor at Caltech, told TechCrunch the U.S. government’s hardline stance on student visas is “harming the talent pipeline.”

“The cumulative effect is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers,” Yue said. “Because research is highly specialized, when a doctoral student is pulled from a project, it can set back the project by months or years. Beyond the specific students and projects affected, many students on visas are worried.”

Few institutions have been spared by the crackdown.According to reports, students attending Ivy League universities, large public colleges, and small liberal arts schools have had their visas suspended. While the governmenthas accused someof these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted forminor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations.

Some of the revocations appear to be administrative mistakes.Reportedly, one student, Suguru Onda, a computer science doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University, had their revoked student visa reinstated without explanation shortly after their immigration attorney filed suit. The attorney, Adam Crayk,saidthe government is using AI to screen visa holders without human verification, leading to errors.

Last week, a judge in Georgiaissued a temporary restraining orderin the case of around 100 international students whose visas were revoked, and directed the government to reinstate the students’ legal status. The ruling only applies to a fraction of students at risk of deportation, however, and could be challenged down the line.

Yue noted that international students contributed to many recent technical breakthroughs in AI. Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa.

Arecent analysisby the nonprofit educational association NAFSA found that international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the domestic economy during the 2023-2024 academic year and supported more than 378,000 jobs.

Yue says that he’s had “multiple conversations” with senior AI researchers who are worried about staying in the United States.

“This includes professors at top universities and researchers at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and so on,” he added. “The cumulative effect of the government’s actions is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers.”

Instagram is using AI to find teens lying about their age and restricting their accounts,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/instagram-is-using-ai-to-find-teens-lying-about-their-age-and-restricting-their-accounts/,TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,21-04-25,"Meta is using AI technology to search for kids who are lying about their age on Instagram in order to bypass safeguards, the companyannouncedon Monday. When Meta finds an account that it suspects belongs to a teen, the platform will enroll them into a restricted Teen Account, even if the account lists an adult birthday.

Teen Accounts, whichlaunched on Instagram last year, enroll young users into an app experience with built-in protections. The safeguards are applied to teens automatically, and limit who can contact a teen on the app and restrict the type of content the account holder can view. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents’ permission to change any of these settings.

Instagram has been using AI to determine age for quite some time, but now the social network confirms it’s using the technology to ensure that teens are accessing Instagram via a Teen Account rather than an adult one.

The company told TechCrunch last year that ithad planned to do this, and noted that some of the ways it would find accounts that belong to teens who entered a fake adult birthday is by detecting happy birthday posts and receiving reports from other users.

Instagram says that it’s taking steps to ensure that its technology is accurate and that it’s correctly placing teens into Teen Accounts. However, in case the company does make a mistake, it’s giving people the option to change their settings.

“The digital world continues to evolve and we have to evolve with it,” the company wrote in its blog post. “That’s why it’s important that we work together with parents to make sure as many teens as possible have the protective settings that come with Teen Accounts.”

Instagram also announced that it’s going to begin sending notifications to parents that include information about how they can discuss the importance of providing the correct age online with their teens. The platform notes that one of the most important ways parents can make sure their teens are in protected accounts is to check if their account lists their correct birthday.

Today’s announcement comes two weeks after Metaintroduced Teen Accountsto Facebook and Messenger.

Meta says it has enrolled at least 54 million teens into Teen Accounts globally so far, and that 97% of teens ages 13-15 have remained in these protected accounts.

ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,21-04-25,"ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launchin November 2022.What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code withshort text promptshas evolved into a behemoth with300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from itspartnership with Applefor its generative AI offering,Apple Intelligence,the release ofGPT-4o with voice capabilities,and the highly-anticipated launch of itstext-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder andlongtime chief scientist Ilya SutskeverandCTO Mira Murati.OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits fromAlden Global Capital-owned newspapersalleging copyright infringement, as well asan injunction from Elon Muskto halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race toChinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates,go here.



OpenAI has launcheda new API feature called Flex processingthat allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.

OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor itsAI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated inOpenAI’s safety report.

OpenAIhas released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. Butthey hallucinatemore than several of OpenAI’s previous models.

Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, perthe company’s X post.

OpenAI said on Tuesdaythat it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.

OpenAIis currently in the early stages of developingits own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads,according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.

OpenAIwill discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.

OpenAIhas launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model— GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such asGoogle’s Gemini 2.5 Pro,Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, andDeepSeek’s upgraded V3.

OpenAIplans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model,per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.

OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Vergereported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAIstarted updating ChatGPTto enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blahospotteda new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-monthChatGPT Plussubscription tier for free to all college studentsin the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT gotthe upgraded image generatoron March 25, according toCOO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made availableto all ChatGPT userson March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher,possibly around $30,000 per task.

In aseriesof postson X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.

OpeanAIintends to release its “first” open language modelsinceGPT-2“in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAImade a notable change to its content moderation policiesafter the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to createStudio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as statedin a blog postpublished by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.

OpenAIwants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEOSam Altman said.

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPThas triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images havesparked concerns aboutwhether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloombergreported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.

OpenAI onTuesdayrolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now usethe GPT-4omodel to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEOSam Altman said on Wednesday,however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnershipsas CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, accordingto a blog postfrom OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAIhas updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’sofficial media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,”a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country,per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norwaywho was shocked to discover that ChatGPTwas providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAIhas added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAIhas introduced o1-proin its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than itso1 “reasoning” AI modelto deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much asOpenAI’s GPT-4.5for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI,thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years agoif researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in apost on X, that the company hastrained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.And it turns out that itmight not be that greatat creative writing at all.

OpenAIrolled out new toolsdesignedto help developers and businesses build AI agents— automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar toOpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replacesOpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAIintends to release several “agent” productstailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according toa report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT appallows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According toa new reportfrom VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT,experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024.It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from100 million in November 2023to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to300 million by December 2024and400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.

OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o.

There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users.

It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy afterFuturism reportedthe publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase. Another isChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in ourtests, they’re inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAIrecentlydisclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI isinvolvedin at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

Tesla reportedly delays launch of new low-cost model by months,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tesla-reportedly-delays-launch-of-new-low-cost-model-by-months/,TechCrunch,,21-04-25,"Posted:

Tesla is pushing back the promised launch of a more affordable EV by months, according to areportfrom Reuters. The new model, which is supposedly a very stripped-down Model Y, was supposed to debut in thefirst half of this yearbut now might not come until late 2025 or early 2026, states the report.

This all comes as Tesla’ssales are tumblingin many parts of the world thanks to a combination of an aging lineup of vehicles, Musk’sfar-right politicsand involvement in the U.S. government, and theunderperformance of the Cybertruck.

CEO Elon Musk firstteased the ideaof making a $25,000 Tesla at the company’s “Battery Day” event in 2020. Tesla was developing a new platform that would be 50% cheaper to build, which it planned to use to power this new model, often colloquially referred to as the “Model 2,” as well as the company’s mythic robotaxi.

But Musk ultimatelykilled the ideaof building a drivable car on the new platform. Instead, hereportedlypivoted Tesla toward developing lower-cost versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan.

Airbnb will now show users the total cost of their stay right away,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/airbnb-will-automatically-display-total-price-to-all-users/,TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,21-04-25,"One of the chief complaints of Airbnb users over the years has been not being able to tell right away how much they would pay for their stay, including charges such as cleaning fees. Airbnb is now fixing that by showing the total cost for a given property, including all charges, automatically.

Users across the world will now see prices before taxes by default when they search for properties. When you search for properties on the web, Airbnb now shows a small label that reads, “Prices include all fees.”

Airbnb started testing thisfeature in 2019in some countries in Europe as well as Australia, Canada, and Korea. In 2022, the company introducedan optional toggle to display price before taxes in search resultsin the U.S. and 200 other countries.

In 2023, it expanded the toggle’s reach toprice filter, maps, and listing pages. Airbnb said 17 million users have used the feature since it was rolled out. The toggle is now going away with the new release.

Airbnb said that it has provided a feature since 2023 that lets hosts see properties similar to theirs and compare pricing. Hosts will also be shown how much their guests are paying before taxes to help readjust pricing.

Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/palantir-exec-defends-companys-immigration-surveillance-work/,TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,20-04-25,"One of the founders of startup accelerator Y Combinator offered unsparing criticism this weekend of the controversial data analytics company Palantir, leading a company executive to offer an extensive defense of Palantir’s work.

The back-and-forth came afterfederal filingsshowed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy — is paying Palantir $30 million to createwhat it’s calling the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, to help ICE decide who to target for deportation, as well as offering “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations.

Y Combinator founderPaul Graham shared headlines about Palantir’s contract on X, writing, “It’s a very exciting time in tech right now. If you’re a first-rate programmer, there are a huge number of other places you can go work rather than at the company building the infrastructure of the police state.”

In response, Palantir’s global head of commercialTed Mabrey wrotethat he’s “looking forward to the next set of hires that decided to apply to Palantir after reading your post.”

Mabrey did not discuss the specifics of Palantir’s current work with ICE, but he said the company started working with the Department of Homeland Security (under which ICE operates) “in the immediate response to the murder of Agent Jaime Zapata by the Zetas in an effort dubbedOperation Fallen Hero.”

“When people are alive because of what you built, and others are dead because what you built was not yet good enough, you develop a very different perspective on the meaning of your work,” Mabrey said.

He also compared Graham’s criticism toprotests over Google’s Project Mavenin 2018, which eventually prompted the company to stop its work analyzing drone images for the military. (Google has subsequently signaled thatit’s become more open to defense workagain.)

Mabrey urged anyone interested in working for Palantir to read CEO Alexander Karp’s new book “The Technological Republic,” whichargues that the software industry needs to rebuild its relationship with the government. (The company has beenrecruiting on college campuseswith signs declaring that “a moment of reckoning has arrived for the West.”)

“We hire believers,” Mabrey continued. “Not in the sense of homogeneity of belief but in the intrinsic capacity to believe in something bigger than yourself. Belief is required because 1) our work is very, very hard and 2) you should expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle.”

Graham thenpressed Mabreyto “commit publicly on behalf of Palantir not to build things that help the government violate the US constitution,” though heacknowledged in another postthat such a commitment would have “no legal force.”

“But I’m hoping that if they [make the commitment], and some Palantir employee is one day asked to do something illegal, he’ll say ‘I didn’t sign up for this’ and refuse,” Graham wrote.

Mabrey in turncompared Graham’s questionto “the ‘will you promise to stop beating your wife’ court room parlor trick,” but he added that the company has “made this promise so many ways from Sunday,” starting with a commitment to “the 3500 enormously thoughtful people who are grinding only because they believe they are making the world a better place every single day as they see first hand what we are actually doing.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scores lower on a benchmark than the company initially implied,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/openais-o3-ai-model-scores-lower-on-a-benchmark-than-the-company-initially-implied/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,20-04-25,"A discrepancy between first- and third-party benchmark results for OpenAI’s o3 AI model israising questions about the company’s transparencyand model testing practices.

When OpenAIunveiled o3 in December, the company claimed the model could answer just over  a fourth of questions on FrontierMath, a challenging set of math problems. That score blew the competition away — the next-best model managed to answer only around 2% of FrontierMath problems correctly.

“Today, all offerings out there have less than 2% [on FrontierMath],” Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI,said during a livestream. “We’re seeing [internally], with o3 in aggressive test-time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.”

As it turns out, that figure was likely an upper bound, achieved by a version of o3 with more computing behind it than the model OpenAI publicly launched last week.

Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, released results of its independent benchmark tests of o3 on Friday. Epoch found that o3 scored around 10%, well below OpenAI’s highest claimed score.

OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini.

We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread!pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B

— Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch)April 18, 2025



That doesn’t mean OpenAI lied, per se. The benchmark results the company published in December show a lower-bound score that matches the score Epoch observed. Epoch also noted its testing setup likely differs from OpenAI’s, and that it used an updated release of FrontierMath for its evaluations.

“The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test-time [computing], or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath (the 180 problems in frontiermath-2024-11-26 vs the 290 problems in frontiermath-2025-02-28-private),”wroteEpoch.

According to a post on Xfrom the ARC Prize Foundation, an organization that tested a prerelease version of o3, the public o3 model “is a different model […] tuned for chat/product use,” corroborating Epoch’s report.

“All released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we [benchmarked],” wrote ARC Prize. Generally speaking, bigger compute tiers can be expected to achieve better benchmark scores.

Re-testing released o3 on ARC-AGI-1 will take a day or two. Because today’s release is a materially different system, we are re-labeling our past reported results as “preview”:

o3-preview (low): 75.7%, $200/tasko3-preview (high): 87.5%, $34.4k/task

Above uses o1 pro pricing…

— Mike Knoop (@mikeknoop)April 16, 2025



OpenAI’s own Wenda Zhou, a member of the technical staff,said during a livestream last weekthat the o3 in production is “more optimized for real-world use cases” and speed versus the version of o3 demoed in December. As a result, it may exhibit benchmark “disparities,” he added.

“[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost-efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.”

Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks.

It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell.

Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models.

In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public.

More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/an-ai-doctoral-candidate-in-california-says-they-had-their-student-visa-revoked/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,21-04-25,"An AI doctoral student in California had their SEVIS record — the digital proof of their valid student visa — terminated, putting their immigration status at risk.

Speaking to TechCrunch, the student, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said they were notified via their college’s international student center that they’d been identified in a criminal records check. The student said that they’d been studying in the U.S. for nearly a decade starting as an undergraduate, and that they have no criminal record.

“The most likely cause may be an interaction with the police many years ago, even before I entered graduate school,” the student said. “I was conducting research in the AI field and had planned to continue my research after graduation.”

Over the past few months,more than a thousand international students in the U.S.have had their visa statuses challenged by the State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an aggressive crackdown orchestrated by the Trump administration. In many cases, colleges haven’t been directly notified by the relevant federal agencies, leaving students with little notice — or recourse.

Yisong Yue, a machine learning professor at Caltech, told TechCrunch the U.S. government’s hardline stance on student visas is “harming the talent pipeline.”

“The cumulative effect is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers,” Yue said. “Because research is highly specialized, when a doctoral student is pulled from a project, it can set back the project by months or years. Beyond the specific students and projects affected, many students on visas are worried.”

Few institutions have been spared by the crackdown.According to reports, students attending Ivy League universities, large public colleges, and small liberal arts schools have had their visas suspended. While the governmenthas accused someof these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted forminor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations.

Some of the revocations appear to be administrative mistakes.Reportedly, one student, Suguru Onda, a computer science doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University, had their revoked student visa reinstated without explanation shortly after their immigration attorney filed suit. The attorney, Adam Crayk,saidthe government is using AI to screen visa holders without human verification, leading to errors.

Last week, a judge in Georgiaissued a temporary restraining orderin the case of around 100 international students whose visas were revoked, and directed the government to reinstate the students’ legal status. The ruling only applies to a fraction of students at risk of deportation, however, and could be challenged down the line.

Yue noted that international students contributed to many recent technical breakthroughs in AI. Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa.

Arecent analysisby the nonprofit educational association NAFSA found that international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the domestic economy during the 2023-2024 academic year and supported more than 378,000 jobs.

Yue says that he’s had “multiple conversations” with senior AI researchers who are worried about staying in the United States.

“This includes professors at top universities and researchers at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and so on,” he added. “The cumulative effect of the government’s actions is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers.”

“[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost-efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.”

Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks.

It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell.

Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models.

In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public.

More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/your-politeness-could-be-costly-for-openai/,TechCrunch,,20-04-25,"Posted:

“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to their models.”

It was aseemingly random questionposed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanjumped in to replythat typing those words has added up to “tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.”

Judging from Altman’s tongue-in-cheek tone, it’s probably safe to assume he didn’t do a precise calculation. But his response prompted Futurism tospeculate about whether it’s actually a waste of timeand electricity to be polite to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots.

Apparently, being polite to AI isn’t just an unnecessary habit, misplaced anthropomorphism, or fear of our future computer overlords. Instead,Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, saidthat “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back.”

Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/uncovered-emails-showed-how-meta-struggled-to-keep-facebook-culturally-relevant/,TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,20-04-25,"With the first week of Meta’santitrust trialbehind us, documents shared by the U.S Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offered more insight into Meta’s internal struggles to keep Facebook relevant. In emails from 2022, Meta executives mulled different visions for Facebook’s future to boost its success, acknowledging that its cultural relevance was decreasing.

Fast-forward to 2025, and Meta is still grappling with this issue. Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s Q4 earnings call in January that the company wants torestore Facebook’s cultural relevancethis year with a return to “OG Facebook.” Part of its solution for this problem is the recent launch of arevamped Friends tab.

Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/,TechCrunch,Julie Bort,19-04-25,"Every now and then, a Silicon Valley startup launches with such an “absurdly” described mission that it’s difficult to discern if the startup is for real or just satire.

Such is the case withMechanize, a startup whose founder — and the non-profit AI research organization he founded called Epoch — is being skewered on X after he announced it.

Complaints encompass both the startup’s mission, and the implication that it sullies the reputation of his well-respected research institute. (A director at the research institute evenpostedon X, “Yay just what I wanted for my bday: a comms crisis.”)

Mechanize was launched on Thursday via apost on Xby its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup’s goal, Besiroglu wrote, is “the full automation of all work” and “the full automation of the economy.”

Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible.

Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize’s total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. “The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year,” he wrote.

Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that “our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work” rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics.

The response to the startup was often brutal. As X userAnthony Aguirrereplied, “Huge respect for the founders’ work at Epoch, but sad to see this. The automation of most human labor is indeed a giant prize forcompanies, which is why many of the biggest companies on Earth are already pursuing it. I think it will be a huge loss for mosthumans.”

But the controversial part isn’t just this startup’s mission. Besiroglu’s AI research institute, Epoch, analyzes the economic impact of AI and produces benchmarks for AI performance. It was believed to be an impartial way to check performance claims of the SATA frontier model makers and others.

This isn’t the first timeEpoch has waded into controversy. In December, Epoch revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks, which the ChatGPT maker then used to unveil its new o3 model. Social media users felt Epoch should have been more up front about the relationship.

When Besiroglu announced Mechanize, X userOliver Habryka replied, “Alas, this seems like approximate confirmation that Epoch research was directly feeding into frontier capability work, though I had hope that it wouldn’t literally come from you.”

Besiroglu says Mechanize is backed by a who’s who: Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Patrick Collison, Dwarkesh Patel, Jeff Dean, Sholto Douglas, and Marcus Abramovitch. Friedman, Gross, and Dean did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Marcus Abramovitch confirmed that he invested. Abramovitch is a managing partner at crypto hedge fund AltX and aself-described“effective altruist.”

He told TechCrunch he invested because “the team is exceptional across many dimensions and have thought deeper on AI than anyone I know.”

Still, Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through “explosive economic growth.” He points to apaper he publishedon the topic.

“Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can’t even imagine today,” he told TechCrunch.

This might be true for whoever owns the agents. That is, if employers pay for them instead of developing them in-house (presumably, by other agents?).

On the other hand, this optimistic outlook overlooks a basic fact: If humans don’t have jobs, they won’t have the income to purchase all the things the AI agents are producing.

Still, Besiroglu says that human wages in such an AI-automated world should actually increase because such workers are “more valuable in complementary roles that AI cannot perform.”

But remember, the goal is for the agents to do all the work. When asked about that, he explained, “Even in scenarios where wages might decrease, economic well-being isn’t solely determined by wages. People typically receive income from other sources — such as rents, dividends, and government welfare.”

So perhaps we all make our living from stocks or real estate. Failing that, there’s always welfare — if the AI agents are paying taxes.

Even though Besiroglu vision and mission are clearly extreme, the technical issue he’s looking to solve is legit. If each human worker has a personal crew of agents that helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow. And Besiroglu is unquestionably right on at least one thing: A year into the age of AI agents,they don’t work very well.

He notes that they are unreliable, don’t retain information, struggle to independently complete tasks as asked, “and can’t execute long-term plans without going off the rails.”

However, he’s hardly alone in working on fixes. Giant companies likeSalesforce and Microsoftare building agentic platforms.OpenAI is too. And agent startups abound: from task specialists (e.g., outbound sales, financial analysis) to those working on training data. Others are working onagent pricing economics.

In the meantime, Besiroglu wants you to know: Mechanize is hiring.

Kids sure love video game movies,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/kids-sure-love-video-game-movies/,TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,20-04-25,"“A Minecraft Movie” isn’tjust a hit— after three weekends in theaters, the film isestimatedto have grossed $344 million domestically and $720 million worldwide. That makes it the biggest movie of an admittedly underwhelming year at the box office (so far), and the second biggest video game movie of all time.

Coming two years afterthe massive success of “The Super Mario Bros. Movie”($1.36 billion worldwide), and amidst the continued popularity of “Sonic the Hedgehog” films, it’s probably safe to sayHollywood’s video game adaptation cursehas been broken.

In fact, one anonymous studio executive toldthe Financial Timesthat video games have “replaced comic books as the next frontier of IP to be explored.” And just as superhero movies generally became more faithful to their source material during the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this executive said that the key to a successful video game movie is “fan service” — i.e., staying true to “the characters and the milieu of the game and the attention to detail.”

It also seems noteworthy that the biggest game-to-movie success stories have been kid-friendly titles like “Minecraft” (adapted from the Mojang Studios sandbox game first released in 2011) and “Super Mario,” while the most successful game adaptations for adults — namely, “Fallout” and “The Last of Us” — were made for streaming and TV.

“A Minecraft Movie” also benefited from some viral luck, after TikTok videosinspired young fans to scream, jump around, throw popcorn, and more, during a key scene when actor Jack Black yells the immortal words, “Chicken jockey!”

Apparently, some theater owners are ambivalent aboutthe #GentleMinions-like trend, but the filmmakers have embraced it, with director Jared Hesstelling Entertainment Weeklythat it’s “weird when you’re having too much fun and the cops get called.” And it’s certainly turned the act of seeing “A Minecraft Movie” in theaters into a real event.

The film was actually unseated from the top of the box office charts this weekend, witha surprise victory for the original horror film “Sinners.”But “Minecraft” still made an estimated $41.3 million domestically in its third weekend, suggesting that those box office totals are going to keep going up.

And yes, it sounds like Warner Bros. (the studio that released both “Minecraft” and “Sinners”) is thinking about a sequel, with President of Development and Production Jesse Ehrman telling the FT, “The fans want more, so hopefully we’ll be able to figure something out.”

Congress has questions about 23andMe bankruptcy,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/congress-has-questions-about-23andme-bankruptcy/,TechCrunch,,19-04-25,"Posted:

Leaders of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said they are investigating how 23andMe’s bankruptcy might affect customers’ data.

Representatives Brett Guthrie, Gus Bilirakis, and Gary Palmer (all Republicans)sent a letterThursday to the genetic testing company’s interim CEO, Joe Selsavage, asking a number of questions about how 23andMe will handle customer data if the company is sold.

The letter also says that some customers have reported problems deleting their data from the 23andMe website, and it notes that direct-to-consumer companies like 23andMe are generally not covered by the protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

“Given the lack of HIPAA protections, the patchwork of state laws covering genetic privacy, and the uncertainty surrounding what happens to customer information should a sale of a company or customer data and information transpire, we are concerned that this trove of sensitive information is at risk of being compromised,” the representatives write.

Last year, 23andMesettled a data breach lawsuitfor $30 million andfiled for chapter 11 bankruptcyin March, with co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki saying she was resigning to become a private bidder for the company.

"Robots run a half-marathon, slowly",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/robots-run-a-half-marathon-slowly/,TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,19-04-25,"It looks like humanoid robots have a long way to go before catching up with human runners.

Beijing’s E-Town tech hub hosted what it described as the world’s first humanoid half-marathon on Saturday, with 21 humanoid robots competing alongside thousands of humans.

Bloomberg reportsthat the winning robot, Tiangong Ultra, was built by the government-backed research institute X-Humanoid and finished the race in two hours and 40 minutes. This would not be an impressive time for a human — the race’s winning male runner finished in one hour and two minutes, and it’s normal for casual runners to complete a half-marathon in (brag alert)under two hours.

Tiangong Ultra needed human assistance to win — specifically a human who ran ahead with a signaling device on his back, enabling the robot to imitate his movements. (Most other robots were remote controlled, with human operators running beside them.)

Every other robot needed at least three hours to complete the race, and only four robots in total managed to finish ahead of the four-hour cutoff time,according to Bloomberg. Some robots barely made it past the starting line — for example, Shennongtripped a human support runner, then slammed into a fence and shattered. At one point, Little Giant (the shortest competitor, at 30 inches in height), paused as smoke emerged from its head.

The Beijing E-Town Humanoid Robot Half Marathon featured robots built by Chinese companies, as well as student groups. (Unitree’s G1 robot fell at the starting line, but the company said a client had used the robot without its algorithms.)

In order to compete, robots needed to have a humanoid appearance and run on two legs. They ran in a separate, fenced-off lane from the humans, with staggered start times to reduce the risk that they’d run into each other. Battery changes were allowed (Tiangong Ultra’s battery was changed three times), and substitute robots could even be swapped in with a time penalty.

X-Humanoid’s chief technology officer Tang Jiangtold Reuters, “I don’t want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong’s sporting achievements.”

Week in Review: Google loses a major antitrust case,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/week-in-review-google-loses-a-major-antitrust-case/,TechCrunch,Karyne Levy,19-04-25,"Welcome back to Week in Review! We’ve got tons of stuff for you this week: antitrust lawsuits against Google and Meta; Grok can now remember; Bolt CEO Ryan Breslow wants to make his mark; and much, much more. Have a great weekend!

It’s over:Googleviolated antitrust lawsin the ad tech market, a judge ruled, ending a two-year battle after eight states filed complaints against the Big Tech giant. Remedies could include forcing Google to break up its advertising business, like selling Google Ad Manager. “We won half of this case, and we will appeal the other half,” said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs.

Gone surfing:OpenAI isreportedly in talks to buy Windsurf, formerly Codeium, which makes a popular coding assistant. Before the news broke,OpenAI approached Anysphere, which makes Cursor, another coding assistant. These talks signal how important capturing a slice of the code-generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker.

A tweet started it all:Theseus, a defense tech company, tweeted that it had built a cheap drone at a hackathon with tech that had clear potential to combat rampant GPS jamming of drones. The tweet went viral, and the company soon found itself in Y Combinator’s 2024 cohort with$4.3 million in seed funding. The U.S. Special Forces has also entered into an agreement for early testing and development.

Meta on the stand:The government’s antitrust suit against Meta started with a bang this week. Among the testimony, a few things stood out: Mark Zuckerbergonce proposed the strategyof “wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again” to try and make Facebook culturally relevant again. And around the time that Meta noticedTikTok affecting its growth, it stopped reporting Facebook’s user numbers in its quarterly reports.

New trend in town:People are using ChatGPT to figure out the location shown in pictures. These image-analyzing capabilities, paired with the models’ ability to search the web, make for apotent location-finding tool. Great, just what we wanted.

Grok catches up:Groknow has a “memory” featurethat lets the bot remember details from past conversations with a user, and it’s available in beta on Grok.com and in the Grok iOS and Android apps in the U.S. It should be noted that ChatGPT and Gemini both already have this feature.

Climate for the win:Big Tech companies are in a race to see who can eliminate carbon pollution first. This week Apple announced thatit’s halfway there: Since 2015, the company says it has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by around 60%.

Back at it:After retaking the helm at Bolt, CEO Ryan Breslow announced this week a“one-click crypto and everyday payments” solutionall in one “super app” that he hopes will formally mark his return as the company’s leader.

Oh?Nvidia said this week that it was informed by the U.S. government that it will need a license toexport its H20 AI chips to China. Earlier in the week it flagged that it will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to startproducing some of those chips in the U.S., but it was light on details.

Call me “Dev Mode” now:Figmasent a cease-and-desistto popular no-code AI agent Lovable so it would stop using the term “Dev Mode” for a new product feature. Figma also has a product called Dev Mode, which it trademarked last year. Isn’t there enough Dev Mode to go around?

Where in the world?Rippling filed a lawsuit against rival Deel alleging that Deel paid one of its employees to spy on Rippling. Rippling was trying to serve Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz with papers butcouldn’t find him. Now it’s even more complicated:Bouaziz and his lawyers are in Dubai, which has a reputation for being a safe haven for those wanting to avoid extradition.

More AI with your AI:Notion this week released Notion Mail, an AI-powered email client that hooks up with your Gmail to help organize emails, draft responses, schedule meetings, and search across messages.

Lucid Gravity first drive:“The Lucid Gravity may just be over-engineering at its best,” writes Abigail Bassett, whotook a spin in the electric SUV. It’s poised to take market share from the likes of other luxury EV and internal combustion SUVs like the Rivian R1S, Cadillac Escalade IQ, BMW X7, and Audi Q8.

Ah, nature:Need something relaxing to do this weekend? Check out the Great Moose Migration livestream, which offers 24 hours of tranquil scenes of forests and rivers. And if you’re lucky,you just might glimpse a passing moose. What could be better than that?

Read what Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook execs said about Instagram before buying it,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/read-what-mark-zuckerberg-and-facebook-execs-said-about-instagram-before-buying-it/,TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,19-04-25,"The first week of theMeta antitrust trialbrought new revelations about how the company formerly known as Facebook approached the competitive threat posed by Instagram in the early 2010s.

The U.S. government is accusing Meta of violating competition laws by acquiring companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that threatened the Facebook monopoly. If lawyers for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are successful, the government could force Meta to break up its business by selling off Instagram and WhatsApp.

As part of the trial, the FTC shared compelling evidence to demonstrate that Facebook was very much aware of the risk Instagram created for its business as the photo-sharing app grew in popularity. In documents containing Facebook’s internal emails, Facebook execs fret over Instagram’s growth and discuss how much to pay for the app, if Facebook were to acquire it.

The company execs also discuss other strategies for limiting Instagram’s growth, including copying its functionality and releasing an app of their own, or buying the app and then no longer adding new features to it while working on its own products.

Facebook’s strategy to either buy or bury its competition is on display in these conversations, according to the government’s arguments. In addition to showing how the company was thinking about its competition at the time, the messages are indicative of the cutthroat strategies that have allowed Meta to become the social networking behemoth it is today.

Some of the highlights from these messages are below.

Is laying off 200 people at its Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck facility in Michigan, which produces GM’s electric vehicles. The cuts come amid the EV slowdown and is not caused by tariffs, according toa report.

Hasreportedlylet go of around 100 employees since the start of 2025. Earlier this week, about 50 employees from the tech and product teams were let go in the latest round of job cuts. The India-based insurtech startup has raised a total of $125 million to date.

Will reduce its workforce by 150 positions following its decision not to proceed with its IPO,per Bloomberg. The San Francisco-based car rental startup, which had about 1,000 staff in 2024, said the layoffs will bolster its long-term growth plans during economic uncertainty.

Laid off roughly 200 employeesto improve efficiency and profitability. It’s the startup’s second round of layoffs in five months, following the job cuts of around 300 employees in December. The conversational AI company, backed by Tiger Global and Fidelity, was last valued at $1.4 billion in 2021. The startup is based in San Francisco and operates in India.

Hasreportedlyeliminated 200 jobs, affecting around one-third of its employees. The German logistics startup reduced a significant number of sales staff.

A new kids’ show will come with a crypto wallet when it debuts this fall,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/a-new-kids-show-will-come-with-a-crypto-wallet-when-it-debuts-this-fall/,TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,18-04-25,"A new animated kids’ series expected to premiere this year won’t be headed for a TV network. Or a streaming service. Instead, the founders of production studio We Ghosted Media plan to launch on a decentralized web platform that uses blockchain technology.

And yes, a crypto wallet will be involved.

We Ghosted Media — founded byChris Jammal, an assistant director for “Bob’s Burgers,” andJaclynn Demas, producer of hit children’s show “Peg + Cat” — is a TV production studio abandoning traditional show release methods in favor of a decentralized approach, commonly referred to as web3.

The studio announced Friday it was teaming up withLamina1to launch the new animated kids’ series entitled “Owen Nowhere.”

Lamina1 was founded by“Snow Crash” author Neal Stephensonand launched in 2022 as a Layer 1 blockchain platform designed to give creators an environment to protect, control, and monetize their intellectual property. Lamina1’s overarching mission, however, is to build an open metaverse. Stephenson’s vision of the metaverse — a concept he coined in his 1992 acclaimed novel — consists of a virtual world where users get their own lifelike 3D avatar.

Blockchain technology and the metaverse are buzzwords in the tech world and they have been slow to achieve mass adoption. Introducing a kids’ show in this space is particularly bold, considering the production studio will have to figure out how kids will navigate a platform that requires a crypto wallet.

But Jammal and Demas are banking on the freedom of a decentralized platform, which allows the audience to interact and even participate, as a selling point that will win over users.

The new show centers around Owen B. Gloom, a preteen aspiring content creator on a family road trip, documenting their visits to unusual tourist attractions. The family’s dynamic is funny, sweet, and slightly dysfunctional, featuring Owen’s adoptive vampire parents, a magical transforming vehicle, a pet cat, and a fish in a stroller.

But as Jammal and Demas told TechCrunch, this is more than a show. It’s really about their mission to set a “new standard for the future of children’s entertainment in the decentralized era.”

The project will be developed and viewable on Lamina1’s yet-to-be-launched Spaces, an offering that enables creators to create their own virtual worlds. In these worlds, creators can build interactive experiences, digital items, and content in various formats, including 2D, 3D, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR).

Jammal and Demas envision “Owen Nowhere” as an immersive experience that allows fans to engage with the world and contribute their ideas for the series.

The virtual space will also include exclusive behind-the-scenes content, collectible digital assets, and online community-driven experiences like voting. The studio believes that the most attractive feature is the opportunity for viewers to make key decisions for the story, such as suggesting destinations for the family’s adventures.

“We were thinking [fans could] vote for where the Glooms can travel next. Do you want them to come to your hometown? Maybe they want to buy that souvenir that Owen picked up at the Grand Canyon [as] their own digital asset. Maybe they want to change his outfit. There are so many possibilities of how this can go,” Jammal said.

While it’s clear that this show has all the ingredients to resonate with viewers and hold their attention, there will be challenges, including convincing parents to manage a crypto wallet for their child.

Parents may worry that introducing kids to this ecosystem, even indirectly, could expose them to financial manipulation or loss, even if the parents are the ones in control of the wallet.

However, some parents are more open to the idea, with some sending their five-year-olds tocrypto summer camps. In 2022,Zigazoointroduced NFTs for several IPs, including CoComelon.

“It’s a big topic of discussion. It’s like, ‘What permissions do we need in place around it?’” Lamina1 CEO Rebecca Barkin said, adding, “I won’t tell you that we have the perfect answer right now…we’re going to learn real fast as this develops, what protections need to be put in place.”

Owen Nowhere’s digital assets are positioned as a way for fans to be involved in the show and enable them to contribute financially to the show’s production by owning digital collectibles — including artwork, characters, and outfits — fostering a community of supporters who are invested in its success.

“That token can be used as a loyalty token, it doesn’t have to be about cash and trading and the traditional crypto stuff. It’s about token-gated access and rewarding those who are sharing things, who are making really creative contributions to the community,” Barkin explained.

While the new series is primarily aimed at kids and preteens, it’s also designed to appeal to adults. This is similar to how “Bob’s Burgers” attracts many adult fans through its hilarious storylines about parenting.

“We’re not going after that super young demographic,” said Barkin.

Nonetheless, they may need to approach this with transparency and possibly even parental controls to appeal to their entire audience.

Lamina1’s Spaces product is slated to launch in the fall. Another virtual world launching on Spaces is “Artefact,” a project by visual effects company Wētā, known for its work on the “Lord of the Rings” film trilogy.

Lamina1 has raised $9 million to date from notable investors and angels, such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Bloq co-founder Matthew Roszak.

"Techstars increases startup funding to $220,000, mirroring YC structure",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/techstars-increases-startup-funding-to-220000-mirroring-yc-structure/,TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,18-04-25,"Techstars, a nearly 20-year-old startup accelerator, announced new terms for startups that enter its three-month program. The organization willnow invest $220,000, which is $100,000 morethan it offered previously, in companies starting with its fall 2025 batch.

The capital will be divided into two components. The group is offering companies $20,000 in exchange for 5% ownership in the business. Startups will also receive $200,000 in the form of an uncapped SAFE note with a “most favored nation” clause. Put more simply, Techstars’ percentage ownership of its $200,000 SAFE will depend on the company’s subsequent valuations. For example, if the startup’s next financing “prices” it at $10 million, Techstars will receive 2% equity on the SAFE component for a total of 7% ownership.

Techstars’ new terms now closely mirror those of Y Combinator. The famed Silicon Valley accelerator increased its funding to startupsthree years agoby adding a $375,000 SAFE note to its standard deal of $125,000 for 7% of the startup’s equity.

So, which accelerator is offering a better deal for startups? The answer largely depends on the company’s capital needs. Compared to Techstars, startups going through YC get more than double the funding but give up more equity.

OpenAI’s new reasoning AI models hallucinate more,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/,TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,18-04-25,"OpenAI’srecently launched o3 and o4-mini AI modelsare state-of-the-art in many respects. However, the new models still hallucinate, or make things up — in fact, they hallucinatemorethan several of OpenAI’s older models.

Hallucinations have proven to be one of the biggest and most difficult problems to solve in AI, impactingeven today’s best-performing systems. Historically, each new model has improved slightly in the hallucination department, hallucinating less than its predecessor. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for o3 and o4-mini.

According to OpenAI’s internal tests, o3 and o4-mini, which are so-called reasoning models, hallucinatemore oftenthan the company’s previous reasoning models — o1, o1-mini, and o3-mini — as well as OpenAI’s traditional, “non-reasoning” models, such as GPT-4o.

Perhaps more concerning, the ChatGPT maker doesn’t really know why it’s happening.

In its technical report foro3 and o4-mini, OpenAI writes that “more research is needed” to understand why hallucinations are getting worse as it scales up reasoning models. O3 and o4-mini perform better in some areas, including tasks related to coding and math. But because they “make more claims overall,” they’re often led to make “more accurate claims as well as more inaccurate/hallucinated claims,” per the report.

OpenAI found that o3 hallucinated in response to 33% of questions on PersonQA, the company’s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model’s knowledge about people. That’s roughly double the hallucination rate of OpenAI’s previous reasoning models, o1 and o3-mini, which scored 16% and 14.8%, respectively. O4-mini did even worse on PersonQA — hallucinating 48% of the time.

Third-partytestingby Transluce, a nonprofit AI research lab, also found evidence that o3 has a tendency to make up actions it took in the process of arriving at answers. In one example, Transluce observed o3 claiming that it ran code on a 2021 MacBook Pro “outside of ChatGPT,” then copied the numbers into its answer. While o3 has access to some tools, it can’t do that.

“Our hypothesis is that the kind of reinforcement learning used for o-series models may amplify issues that are usually mitigated (but not fully erased) by standard post-training pipelines,” said Neil Chowdhury, a Transluce researcher and former OpenAI employee, in an email to TechCrunch.

Sarah Schwettmann, co-founder of Transluce, added that o3’s hallucination rate may make it less useful than it otherwise would be.

Kian Katanforoosh, a Stanford adjunct professor and CEO of the upskilling startup Workera, told TechCrunch that his team is already testing o3 in their coding workflows, and that they’ve found it to be a step above the competition. However, Katanforoosh says that o3 tends to hallucinate broken website links. The model will supply a link that, when clicked, doesn’t work.

Hallucinations may help models arrive at interesting ideas and be creative in their “thinking,” but they also make some models a tough sell for businesses in markets where accuracy is paramount. For example, a law firm likely wouldn’t be pleased with a model that inserts lots of factual errors into client contracts.

One promising approach to boosting the accuracy of models is giving them web search capabilities. OpenAI’s GPT-4o with web search achieves90% accuracyon SimpleQA, another one of OpenAI’s accuracy benchmarks. Potentially, search could improve reasoning models’ hallucination rates, as well — at least in cases where users are willing to expose prompts to a third-party search provider.

If scaling up reasoning models indeed continues to worsen hallucinations, it’ll make the hunt for a solution all the more urgent.

“Addressing hallucinations across all our models is an ongoing area of research, and we’re continually working to improve their accuracy and reliability,” said OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix in an email to TechCrunch.

In the last year, the broader AI industry has pivoted to focus on reasoning models aftertechniques to improve traditional AI models started showing diminishing returns. Reasoning improves model performance on a variety of tasks without requiring massive amounts of computing and data during training. Yet it seems reasoning also may lead to more hallucinating — presenting a challenge.

Bluesky may soon add blue check verification,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/bluesky-may-soon-add-blue-check-verification/,TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,18-04-25,"Bluesky may soon get a new blue checkmark verification system, according to changes to theapp’s public GitHub repositoryspotted Friday by reverse engineeralice.mosphere.at.

The blue checks may have a similar look to the system pioneered by Twitter, now X, but Bluesky’s version seems like it will work quite differently.

Bluesky’s blue check system may rely on multiple organizations to distribute blue checks, according to the codebase changes. That suggests Bluesky will actively verify notable accounts, but also label certain organizations as “trusted verifiers,” and give them the authority to directly issue blue checks themselves.

The changes to Bluesky’s verification system may be announced as soon as Monday, according to ablog post linkfound in Friday’s pull request titled “verification,” which is dated for April 21, 2025.

While Bluesky already lets users verify themselves by tying their accounts to official websites, CEO Jay Graber has hinted the company would try other types of verification. Last year, Graber said Bluesky may experiment with a systemwhere it’s not the only group that can verify users.

The pull request also shows an icon, a blue circle containing a white checkmark, that will appear on verified users’ profiles. Meanwhile, trusted verifiers will have scalloped blue circles containing a white checkmark on their profiles.

An image spotted in Bluesky’s forthcoming announcement suggests The New York Times, and other trusted news publishers, may soon have the ability to verify users in the blue check system. By tapping on a user’s blue check, other users can see which organizations have granted verification, according to the changes.

Bluesky’s approach to verification is a lot different from how X operates its verification services. While X used to distribute blue checks to popular, authentic accounts, Elon Musk decided to overhaul the system andonly verifies users who pay a monthly subscription. Musk has since walked back that decision,giving blue checks to some influential users that don’t pay for it, while still allowing other people to pay for it.

Some have argued that X has diluted the value of a blue check on its platform altogether, evenallowing some bot accounts to be verified.

Bluesky did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Bluesky seems to be taking a decentralized approach to verification by spreading out the decision-making power to several organizations. That could mean a lot of users on Bluesky are getting verified, but it remains to be seen how this approach will work in practice.

Yes, the SPAC is back. Or did this financial instrument really ever fade away?

A little bird told us that some people are hoping to get ahead of the many, many hurdles eVTOLs need to jump before there can be “highways in the skies.” This includes working with real estate owners in rural areas to set up vertiports and charging infrastructure. The pitch? Adding that infrastructure has the potential to increase your property value in the future.

I expected a few more IPOs in 2025 than the prior year, but SPACs? Say it ain’t so. And yet, here we are with afresh mergerbetween autonomous vehicle technology startupKodiak Roboticsand special purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation II.

The transaction values Kodiak, which has raised around $243 million to date, at about $2.5 billion pre-money. New and existing Kodiak institutional investors, like Soros Fund Management, ARK Investments, and Ares, have funded or committed over $110 million in financing to support the transaction, as well as about $551 million of cash held in trust.

I spoke to Kodiak founder and CEODon Burnetteand asked the obvious question: A SPAC? Now? Why?

“Kodiak, now that we have launched driverless, we have our vehicles on the road, we have driverless revenue coming in,” Burnette told me. “We think now is the time for growth. We want to take advantage of the tailwinds we’re seeing in the markets.”

Tailwinds? I asked him to explain, and Burnette meant tailwinds in the autonomy sector as opposed to the broader economic markets.

“Obviously, we’re seeing short-term volatility — that’s an understatement,” he said. “But we’re really thinking about this as a long-term thesis of transforming the transportation markets, using AI, using technology, and through automation. It’s something I’ve always believed in.”

Other deals that got my attention …

Conifer, a startup developing electric hub motors that are free of rare earth elements, raised a$20 million seed roundfrom investors, including True Ventures, MaC Ventures, MFV Partners, and others. True Ventures’ Rohit Sharma has joined Conifer’s board.

Kavak, a Mexico-based online used car dealer,raised $127 millionin an equity round, cutting its valuation to $2.2 billion from $6.5 billion. The round was co-led by SoftBank Group Corp and General Atlantic. The company also secured $400 million in new debt.

Lyftagreed to acquireFreeNow, a German multi-mobility app with ride-hail at its core, from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for about $197 million in cash. The acquisition opens up the European market to Lyft for the first time.

Nyobolt, a British EV charging startup,raised $30 millionin funding, led by IQ Capital and Latitude. Strategic partners, including Scania Invest and Takasago Industry, also participated.

Chinais cracking down on how automakers advertise driver-assistance features,banning termslike “autonomous driving,” “self-driving,” and “smart driving.” If you immediately thought ofTeslaand its “Full Self-Driving” software, it’s worth noting the automaker has changed the branding. But Tesla and others will be affected by rules around over-the-air software updates for ADAS, which requires testing and government approval.

White House replaces covid.gov website with ‘lab leak’ theory,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/white-house-replaces-covid-gov-website-with-lab-leak-theory/,TechCrunch,,18-04-25,"Posted:

The government-run website covid.gov used to host information about COVID-19 vaccines, testing, and treatment. Now, under President Trump’s purview, the pageredirects to a White House websiteespousing the unproven theory that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese laboratory.

The theory, which has been opposed by many virologists, was espousedin a reportby House Republicans last year that determined the pandemic began with a lab leak in China. House Democratsreleased a rebuttalat the time, stating the probe failed to determine COVID’s true origins.

The covidtests.gov website, where people could previously order free coronavirus tests, also redirects to thisnew page.

The White House’s new website also includes medical disinformation about the treatment of the virus, falsely claiming that social distancing, mask mandates, and lockdowns are not effective at mitigating the spread of COVID-19. However,hundreds of studieshave shown that thesepreventative measuresdo, in fact, reduce the transmission of respiratory infections like COVID-19.

In the months since Trump has reassumed his role as the U.S. president, numerous government websites have been edited to reflect the agenda of his administration. With the help of Elon Musk’sDOGE, the government has attempted to remove from government documents hundreds of words related to diversity. Thisincludeswords like “Black,” “disability,” “diversity,” “gender,” “racism,” “women,” and more. The government has also removed mentions of scientifically-provenclimate changefrom environmental websites.

"ChatGPT is referring to users by their names unprompted, and some find it ‘creepy’",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/chatgpt-is-referring-to-users-by-their-names-unprompted-and-some-find-it-creepy/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,18-04-25,"Some ChatGPT users have noticed a strange phenomenon recently: Occasionally, the chatbot refers to them by name as it reasons through problems. That wasn’t the default behavior previously, and several users claim ChatGPT is mentioning their names despite never having been told what to call them.

Reviews are mixed. One user, software developer and AI enthusiastSimon Willison, called the feature “creepy and unnecessary.” Another developer, Nick Dobos,saidhe “hated it.” A cursory search of X turns upscores of usersconfused by — and wary of — ChatGPT’s first-name basis behavior.

“It’s like a teacher keeps calling my name, LOL,”wrote one user. “Yeah, I don’t like it.”

Does anyone LIKE the thing where o3 uses your name in its chain of thought, as opposed to finding it creepy and unnecessary?pic.twitter.com/lYRby6BK6J

— Simon Willison (@simonw)April 17, 2025



It’s not clear when, exactly, the change happened, or whether it’s related toChatGPT’s upgraded “memory” featurethat lets the chatbot draw on past chats to personalize its responses. Some users on X say ChatGPT began calling them by their names even though they’d disabled memory and related personalization settings.

OpenAI hasn’t responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

It feels weird to see your own name in the model thoughts. Is there any reason to add that? Will it make it better or just make more errors as I did in my github repos?@OpenAIo4-mini-high, is it really using that in the custom prompt?pic.twitter.com/j1Vv7arBx4

In any event, the blowback illustrates the uncanny valley OpenAI might struggle to overcome in its efforts to make ChatGPT more “personal” for the people who use it. Last week, the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, hinted at AI systems that “get to know you over your life” to become “extremely useful and personalized.” But judging by this latest wave of reactions, not everyone’s sold on the idea.

Anarticlepublished by The Valens Clinic, a psychiatry office in Dubai, may shed some light on the visceral reactions to ChatGPT’s name use. Names convey intimacy. But when a person — or chatbot, as the case may be — uses a name a lot, it comes across as inauthentic.

“Using an individual’s name when addressing them directly is a powerful relationship-developing strategy,” writes Valens. “It denotes acceptance and admiration. However, undesirable or extravagant use can be looked at as fake and invasive.”

In a similar vein, perhaps another reason many people don’t want ChatGPT using their name is that it feels ham-fisted — a clumsy attempt at anthropomorphizing an emotionless bot. In the same way that most folks wouldn’t want their toaster calling them by their name, they don’t want ChatGPT to “pretend” it understands a name’s significance.

This reporter certainly found it disquieting when o3 in ChatGPT earlier this week said it was doing research for “Kyle.” (As of Friday, the change seemingly had been reverted; o3 called me “user.”) It had the opposite of the intended effect — poking holes in the illusion that the underlying models are anything more than programmable, synthetic things.

Startups Weekly: Mixed messages from venture capital,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/startups-weekly-mixed-messages-from-venture-capital/,TechCrunch,Anna Heim,18-04-25,"Welcome to Startups Weekly — your weekly recap of everything you can’t miss from the world of startups. Want it in your inbox every Friday?Sign up here.

This week brought us mixed messages. A fresh IPO filing, but a bleak outlook for exits overall. New funding rounds, but founders frustrated over lack of capital. And in the midst of it all, some VCs are still finding ways to create liquidity and raising funding for more bullish times.

In a week of contrasts, startups exhibited both confidence and insecurity, and even second-time founders weren’t spared from struggles.

Fearless or not: Design software company Figmafiled its confidential paperwork for an IPO, ignoring the fears that made both Klarna and StubHub pause their IPO plans this month following the stock market crash triggered by tariff announcements.

Figma, however, isn’t worry-free: It senta cease-and-desist letterto fast-rising “vibe coding” rival Lovable over the term “Dev Mode.”

Frustrated: U.K. founders expressed frustration at thewidening gapbetween funding raised by British startups and their Silicon Valley peers. According to Dealroom, British startups raised just £16.2 billion (approximately $21.5 billion) last year compared to the approximate $73.8 billion (£65 billion) raised in the U.S.

Smashed: Smashing, an AI-powered reading curation app launched last June by Goodreads’ founder Otis Chandler,shut downdue to disappointing growth.

Suspended: BluSmart, an Indian Uber rival using EVs,apparently suspended servicea day after the Securities and Exchange Board of India launched an investigation into Gensol Engineering, which shares its co-founders.

Back: One month after reassuming his role as Bolt’s CEO, Ryan Breslowunveiled a new “super app”that reflects his vision for the fintech company he founded in 2014.

Investigating: Rippling’s efforts to serve Deel CEO Alex Bouazizhave been significantly hinderedby the fact that he and his lawyer are now in the UAE, TechCrunch learned. But the company isn’t giving up and is alsopushing for Revolut to reveal who paid off Deel’s alleged spy.

Tailwinds:OpenAI isreportedly seeking to buy Windsurf for $3 billion. The startup was previously known as Codeium, whose popular AI coding assistant competes with Cursor and the like.

This week brought us funding news that’s hinting at better days ahead, with increased valuations and bigger funds that may no longer be the exception.

Growing: Marshmallow, a British insurance startup,raised $90 million in equity and debtat a valuation slightly above $2 billion. Focusing on customers left out by traditional insurers, it boasts a million drivers insured and a profitable annual revenue run rate of $500 million.

Hammered win: Hammerspace, a company that helps clients like Meta use their unstructured data,raised $100 million in funding to expand its business. The valuation is above $500 million, according to sources.

New chapter: Chapter, a Medicare advisory startup co-founded by former U.S. Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy,raised a $75 million funding roundat a $1.5 billion valuation.

Phantom limbs: Austin, Texas-based Phantom Neuroraised $19 millionto fund the next stage of development of its product, a subdermal wristband-like device that lets amputees control prosthetic limbs.

Resilient: Conifer, a startup whose electric hub motors don’t require rare earth elements,secured a $20 million seed roundfrom deep tech investors.

Sunny days: Arnergy, a clean tech startup backed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, locked down a$15 million Series B extensionto expand solar access in Nigeria.

Bullish: Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund completed the raise of its third growth fund. Closing at $4.6 billion, it is abig step up from its previous $3.4 billion growth fund— which could be another sign that the market has gone from bearish to bullish again.

VCs need liquidity, and they often know how to find it even when there are no IPOs in sight. In the latest episode of StrictlyVC Download, Industry Ventures CEO Hans Swildens broke downthe way in which firms are navigating this issue.

TikToker sues Roblox over her Charli XCX ‘Apple’ dance,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/tiktoker-sues-roblox-over-her-charli-xcx-apple-dance/,TechCrunch,,18-04-25,"Posted:

TikTok content creatorKelley Heyersued the video game Roblox for using herdance to Charli XCX’s “Apple”without permission.

Heyer posted the viral dance in June 2024, which fed off of the hype of Charli XCX’s hit summer album “Brat.” The dance became so popular that Charli XCX incorporated it into her live show and even invited Heyer to perform the dance at her show in New York City.

Fortnite and Roblox, two blockbuster games popular among children, each incorporated the dance into their games, allowing players to purchase “emotes” of the dance for their avatars to perform. But while Fortnite got Heyer’s permission to license her choreography, she alleges that Robloxdid not sign an agreementto do so.

“Roblox moved forward using Kelley’s IP without a signed agreement. Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that,” said Miki Anzai, Heyer’s attorney. “We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement.”

According toPolygon, Heyer estimates that Roblox earned over $123,000 from selling more than 60,000 emotes of the “Apple” dance.

“As a platform powered by a community of creators, Roblox takes the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform,” Roblox said in a statement.

ChatGPT will now use its ‘memory’ to personalize web searches,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/chatgpt-will-now-use-its-memory-to-personalize-web-searches/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,18-04-25,"OpenAI is upgradingChatGPT’s“memory” again.

In achangelogandsupportpageson OpenAI’s website Thursday, the company quietly announced “Memory with Search,” a feature that lets ChatGPT draw on memories — details from past conversations, such as your favorite foods — to inform queries when the bot searches the web.

ChatGPT release notes were updated yesterday with o3 and o4-mini added to ChatGPT on Apr 16, 2025 – but interestingly, they also mention “Memory with Search” (anyone seen this rolling out already? Not for me yet)pic.twitter.com/oVBcJNqf6z

— Tibor Blaho (@btibor91)April 18, 2025



The update comes shortly after OpenAIbeefed upChatGPT’slong-in-the-tooth memory toolwith the ability to reference a user’s entire chat history. It’s seemingly a part of OpenAI’s ongoing effort to differentiate ChatGPT from rival chatbots likeAnthropic’s ClaudeandGoogle’s Gemini, the latter of which also offers a memory feature.

As OpenAI explains in its documentation, when Memory with Search is enabled and a user types in a prompt that requires a web search, ChatGPT will rewrite that prompt into a search query that “may also leverage relevant information from memories” to “make the query better and more useful.” For example, for a user that ChatGPT “knows” from memory is vegan and lives in San Francisco, ChatGPT may rewrite the prompt “what are some restaurants near me that I’d like” as “good vegan restaurants, San Francisco.”

Memory with Search can be disabled by disabling Memory in the ChatGPT settings menu. It’s not clear which users have it yet —someaccountsonXreport they began seeing Memory with Search earlier this week.

An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/an-ai-doctoral-candidate-in-california-says-they-had-their-student-visa-revoked/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,21-04-25,"An AI doctoral student in California had their SEVIS record — the digital proof of their valid student visa — terminated, putting their immigration status at risk.

Speaking to TechCrunch, the student, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said they were notified via their college’s international student center that they’d been identified in a criminal records check. The student said that they’d been studying in the U.S. for nearly a decade starting as an undergraduate, and that they have no criminal record.

“The most likely cause may be an interaction with the police many years ago, even before I entered graduate school,” the student said. “I was conducting research in the AI field and had planned to continue my research after graduation.”

Over the past few months,more than a thousand international students in the U.S.have had their visa statuses challenged by the State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an aggressive crackdown orchestrated by the Trump administration. In many cases, colleges haven’t been directly notified by the relevant federal agencies, leaving students with little notice — or recourse.

Yisong Yue, a machine learning professor at Caltech, told TechCrunch the U.S. government’s hardline stance on student visas is “harming the talent pipeline.”

“The cumulative effect is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers,” Yue said. “Because research is highly specialized, when a doctoral student is pulled from a project, it can set back the project by months or years. Beyond the specific students and projects affected, many students on visas are worried.”

Few institutions have been spared by the crackdown.According to reports, students attending Ivy League universities, large public colleges, and small liberal arts schools have had their visas suspended. While the governmenthas accused someof these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted forminor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations.

Some of the revocations appear to be administrative mistakes.Reportedly, one student, Suguru Onda, a computer science doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University, had their revoked student visa reinstated without explanation shortly after their immigration attorney filed suit. The attorney, Adam Crayk,saidthe government is using AI to screen visa holders without human verification, leading to errors.

Last week, a judge in Georgiaissued a temporary restraining orderin the case of around 100 international students whose visas were revoked, and directed the government to reinstate the students’ legal status. The ruling only applies to a fraction of students at risk of deportation, however, and could be challenged down the line.

Yue noted that international students contributed to many recent technical breakthroughs in AI. Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa.

Arecent analysisby the nonprofit educational association NAFSA found that international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the domestic economy during the 2023-2024 academic year and supported more than 378,000 jobs.

Yue says that he’s had “multiple conversations” with senior AI researchers who are worried about staying in the United States.

“This includes professors at top universities and researchers at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and so on,” he added. “The cumulative effect of the government’s actions is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers.”

Tesla reportedly delays launch of new low-cost model by months,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tesla-reportedly-delays-launch-of-new-low-cost-model-by-months/,TechCrunch,,21-04-25,"Posted:

Tesla is pushing back the promised launch of a more affordable EV by months, according to areportfrom Reuters. The new model, which is supposedly a very stripped-down Model Y, was supposed to debut in thefirst half of this yearbut now might not come until late 2025 or early 2026, states the report.

This all comes as Tesla’ssales are tumblingin many parts of the world thanks to a combination of an aging lineup of vehicles, Musk’sfar-right politicsand involvement in the U.S. government, and theunderperformance of the Cybertruck.

CEO Elon Musk firstteased the ideaof making a $25,000 Tesla at the company’s “Battery Day” event in 2020. Tesla was developing a new platform that would be 50% cheaper to build, which it planned to use to power this new model, often colloquially referred to as the “Model 2,” as well as the company’s mythic robotaxi.

But Musk ultimatelykilled the ideaof building a drivable car on the new platform. Instead, hereportedlypivoted Tesla toward developing lower-cost versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan.

Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/palantir-exec-defends-companys-immigration-surveillance-work/,TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,20-04-25,"One of the founders of startup accelerator Y Combinator offered unsparing criticism this weekend of the controversial data analytics company Palantir, leading a company executive to offer an extensive defense of Palantir’s work.

The back-and-forth came afterfederal filingsshowed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy — is paying Palantir $30 million to createwhat it’s calling the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, to help ICE decide who to target for deportation, as well as offering “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations.

Y Combinator founderPaul Graham shared headlines about Palantir’s contract on X, writing, “It’s a very exciting time in tech right now. If you’re a first-rate programmer, there are a huge number of other places you can go work rather than at the company building the infrastructure of the police state.”

In response, Palantir’s global head of commercialTed Mabrey wrotethat he’s “looking forward to the next set of hires that decided to apply to Palantir after reading your post.”

Mabrey did not discuss the specifics of Palantir’s current work with ICE, but he said the company started working with the Department of Homeland Security (under which ICE operates) “in the immediate response to the murder of Agent Jaime Zapata by the Zetas in an effort dubbedOperation Fallen Hero.”

“When people are alive because of what you built, and others are dead because what you built was not yet good enough, you develop a very different perspective on the meaning of your work,” Mabrey said.

He also compared Graham’s criticism toprotests over Google’s Project Mavenin 2018, which eventually prompted the company to stop its work analyzing drone images for the military. (Google has subsequently signaled thatit’s become more open to defense workagain.)

Mabrey urged anyone interested in working for Palantir to read CEO Alexander Karp’s new book “The Technological Republic,” whichargues that the software industry needs to rebuild its relationship with the government. (The company has beenrecruiting on college campuseswith signs declaring that “a moment of reckoning has arrived for the West.”)

“We hire believers,” Mabrey continued. “Not in the sense of homogeneity of belief but in the intrinsic capacity to believe in something bigger than yourself. Belief is required because 1) our work is very, very hard and 2) you should expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle.”

Graham thenpressed Mabreyto “commit publicly on behalf of Palantir not to build things that help the government violate the US constitution,” though heacknowledged in another postthat such a commitment would have “no legal force.”

“But I’m hoping that if they [make the commitment], and some Palantir employee is one day asked to do something illegal, he’ll say ‘I didn’t sign up for this’ and refuse,” Graham wrote.

Mabrey in turncompared Graham’s questionto “the ‘will you promise to stop beating your wife’ court room parlor trick,” but he added that the company has “made this promise so many ways from Sunday,” starting with a commitment to “the 3500 enormously thoughtful people who are grinding only because they believe they are making the world a better place every single day as they see first hand what we are actually doing.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scores lower on a benchmark than the company initially implied,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/openais-o3-ai-model-scores-lower-on-a-benchmark-than-the-company-initially-implied/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,20-04-25,"A discrepancy between first- and third-party benchmark results for OpenAI’s o3 AI model israising questions about the company’s transparencyand model testing practices.

When OpenAIunveiled o3 in December, the company claimed the model could answer just over  a fourth of questions on FrontierMath, a challenging set of math problems. That score blew the competition away — the next-best model managed to answer only around 2% of FrontierMath problems correctly.

“Today, all offerings out there have less than 2% [on FrontierMath],” Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI,said during a livestream. “We’re seeing [internally], with o3 in aggressive test-time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.”

As it turns out, that figure was likely an upper bound, achieved by a version of o3 with more computing behind it than the model OpenAI publicly launched last week.

Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, released results of its independent benchmark tests of o3 on Friday. Epoch found that o3 scored around 10%, well below OpenAI’s highest claimed score.

OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini.

We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread!pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B

— Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch)April 18, 2025



That doesn’t mean OpenAI lied, per se. The benchmark results the company published in December show a lower-bound score that matches the score Epoch observed. Epoch also noted its testing setup likely differs from OpenAI’s, and that it used an updated release of FrontierMath for its evaluations.

“The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test-time [computing], or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath (the 180 problems in frontiermath-2024-11-26 vs the 290 problems in frontiermath-2025-02-28-private),”wroteEpoch.

According to a post on Xfrom the ARC Prize Foundation, an organization that tested a prerelease version of o3, the public o3 model “is a different model […] tuned for chat/product use,” corroborating Epoch’s report.

“All released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we [benchmarked],” wrote ARC Prize. Generally speaking, bigger compute tiers can be expected to achieve better benchmark scores.

Re-testing released o3 on ARC-AGI-1 will take a day or two. Because today’s release is a materially different system, we are re-labeling our past reported results as “preview”:

o3-preview (low): 75.7%, $200/tasko3-preview (high): 87.5%, $34.4k/task

Above uses o1 pro pricing…

— Mike Knoop (@mikeknoop)April 16, 2025



OpenAI’s own Wenda Zhou, a member of the technical staff,said during a livestream last weekthat the o3 in production is “more optimized for real-world use cases” and speed versus the version of o3 demoed in December. As a result, it may exhibit benchmark “disparities,” he added.

“[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost-efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.”

Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks.

It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell.

Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models.

In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public.

More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/your-politeness-could-be-costly-for-openai/,TechCrunch,,20-04-25,"Posted:

“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to their models.”

It was aseemingly random questionposed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanjumped in to replythat typing those words has added up to “tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.”

Judging from Altman’s tongue-in-cheek tone, it’s probably safe to assume he didn’t do a precise calculation. But his response prompted Futurism tospeculate about whether it’s actually a waste of timeand electricity to be polite to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots.

Apparently, being polite to AI isn’t just an unnecessary habit, misplaced anthropomorphism, or fear of our future computer overlords. Instead,Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, saidthat “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back.”

That said,profanity has its usestoo.

In emails from 2022, Meta executives mulled different visions for Facebook’s future to boost its success, acknowledging that its cultural relevance was decreasing.

Fast-forward to 2025, and Meta is still grappling with this issue. Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s Q4 earnings call in January that the company wants torestore Facebook’s cultural relevancethis year with a return to “OG Facebook.” Part of its solution for this problem is the recent launch of arevamped Friends tab.

In a series of messages from April 2022 that were shared as evidence during the trial, Zuckerberg discussed concerns about Facebook’s “Friends” structure and format being outdated as every other major platform focused on “Following.”

He considered ditching the Friends format and even suggesteddeleting everyone’s Facebook friendsand having them start again.

Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/,TechCrunch,Julie Bort,19-04-25,"Every now and then, a Silicon Valley startup launches with such an “absurdly” described mission that it’s difficult to discern if the startup is for real or just satire.

Such is the case withMechanize, a startup whose founder — and the non-profit AI research organization he founded called Epoch — is being skewered on X after he announced it.

Complaints encompass both the startup’s mission, and the implication that it sullies the reputation of his well-respected research institute. (A director at the research institute evenpostedon X, “Yay just what I wanted for my bday: a comms crisis.”)

Mechanize was launched on Thursday via apost on Xby its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup’s goal, Besiroglu wrote, is “the full automation of all work” and “the full automation of the economy.”

Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible.

Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize’s total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. “The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year,” he wrote.

Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that “our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work” rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics.

The response to the startup was often brutal. As X userAnthony Aguirrereplied, “Huge respect for the founders’ work at Epoch, but sad to see this. The automation of most human labor is indeed a giant prize forcompanies, which is why many of the biggest companies on Earth are already pursuing it. I think it will be a huge loss for mosthumans.”

But the controversial part isn’t just this startup’s mission. Besiroglu’s AI research institute, Epoch, analyzes the economic impact of AI and produces benchmarks for AI performance. It was believed to be an impartial way to check performance claims of the SATA frontier model makers and others.

This isn’t the first timeEpoch has waded into controversy. In December, Epoch revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks, which the ChatGPT maker then used to unveil its new o3 model. Social media users felt Epoch should have been more up front about the relationship.

When Besiroglu announced Mechanize, X userOliver Habryka replied, “Alas, this seems like approximate confirmation that Epoch research was directly feeding into frontier capability work, though I had hope that it wouldn’t literally come from you.”

Besiroglu says Mechanize is backed by a who’s who: Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Patrick Collison, Dwarkesh Patel, Jeff Dean, Sholto Douglas, and Marcus Abramovitch. Friedman, Gross, and Dean did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Marcus Abramovitch confirmed that he invested. Abramovitch is a managing partner at crypto hedge fund AltX and aself-described“effective altruist.”

He told TechCrunch he invested because “the team is exceptional across many dimensions and have thought deeper on AI than anyone I know.”

Still, Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through “explosive economic growth.” He points to apaper he publishedon the topic.

“Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can’t even imagine today,” he told TechCrunch.

This might be true for whoever owns the agents. That is, if employers pay for them instead of developing them in-house (presumably, by other agents?).

On the other hand, this optimistic outlook overlooks a basic fact: If humans don’t have jobs, they won’t have the income to purchase all the things the AI agents are producing.

Still, Besiroglu says that human wages in such an AI-automated world should actually increase because such workers are “more valuable in complementary roles that AI cannot perform.”

But remember, the goal is for the agents to do all the work. When asked about that, he explained, “Even in scenarios where wages might decrease, economic well-being isn’t solely determined by wages. People typically receive income from other sources — such as rents, dividends, and government welfare.”

So perhaps we all make our living from stocks or real estate. Failing that, there’s always welfare — if the AI agents are paying taxes.

Even though Besiroglu vision and mission are clearly extreme, the technical issue he’s looking to solve is legit. If each human worker has a personal crew of agents that helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow. And Besiroglu is unquestionably right on at least one thing: A year into the age of AI agents,they don’t work very well.

He notes that they are unreliable, don’t retain information, struggle to independently complete tasks as asked, “and can’t execute long-term plans without going off the rails.”

However, he’s hardly alone in working on fixes. Giant companies likeSalesforce and Microsoftare building agentic platforms.OpenAI is too. And agent startups abound: from task specialists (e.g., outbound sales, financial analysis) to those working on training data. Others are working onagent pricing economics.

In the meantime, Besiroglu wants you to know: Mechanize is hiring.

Trump EPA targets two-man geoengineering startup for ‘polluting the air’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/trump-epa-targets-two-man-geoengineering-startup-for-polluting-the-air/,TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,18-04-25,"Humans have found it hard to quit fossil fuels, which is why some argue that we’ll soon need to start geoengineering — that is, modifying the atmosphere to prevent catastrophic warming of the planet.

The practice is controversial. Some argue it’s the only solution given that we’ve waited too long to reduce carbon emissions. Others say we shouldn’t be running two uncontrolled experiments on the Earth’s climate (the first being the global burning of fossil fuels).

That hasn’t stopped people from trying. And one approach championed byMake Sunsetshas drawn the attention of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The startup is basically two guys from Silicon Valley who have been releasing weather balloons filled with hydrogen gas and sulfur dioxide particles. When the balloon floats somewhere past 66,000 feet in altitude, it bursts and releases the sulfur dioxide particles, which scatter and reflect sunlight, cooling the Earth a tiny bit.

The company sells “cooling credits” based on how much estimated warming each balloon release negates. Make Sunsets has raised $750,000, according to PitchBook, and the startup says its investors include Boost VC, Draper Associates, and Pioneer Fund.

Neither founder is a scientist, but the science behind sulfur dioxide and solar reflectivity is sound. Humansaccidentally provedthe importance of sulfur dioxide in global albedo — the average reflectivity of the Earth’s surface — when they slashed the sulfur content of marine shipping fuels in 2020; one prominent climate scientist hasargued in favorof the practice.

Still, given the complexity of the global climate, it’s not clear what other effects the practice might have. It might seed rainstorms in one region while depriving other areas of rain. Several scientists haveurged caution.

Plus, if sulfur dioxide particles drift closer to ground, they could aggravate people’s asthma and cause other respiratory problems. Here, the EPA takes issue with Make Sunsets’ approach to geoengineering. Sulfur dioxide is regulated as an air pollutant. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said this week that the agency isinvestigating the company.

Make Sunsets argues its actions are legal. In anFAQon its website, the company says, “Yes, our method to cool Earth falls under the Weather Modification Act of 1976 and report yearly to NOAA of our deployments as required.”

The law is fuzzy here, though. When it was written, the Weather Modification Act was likely intended to cover the practice of cloud seeding, in which particles like silver iodide are shot into clouds to induce rain or snowfall. Most weather modification today is done by entities likeski resortsandirrigation districts in the West. It’snot clearhow the law applies to climate modification.

Still, while the EPA might be justified in its investigation, it isn’t exactly consistent with Zeldin’s approach to pollution.

The agency’sefforts to boost coalare likely to generate far more sulfur dioxide pollution than Make Sunsets will release with its balloons. A Make Sunsets balloon released onNovember 15, 2024, released 1,715 grams of sulfur dioxide. In 2023, U.S. power plants released650,000 tonsinto the atmosphere, themajorityof which came from coal. That’s approximately the same amount as 343,900,000 of the startup’s balloons.

Is the SPAC back?,https://techcrunch.com/podcast/is-the-spac-back/,TechCrunch,Theresa Loconsolo,18-04-25,"Kodiak Robotics made a financial move that was ubiquitous in 2021. Yup, the self-driving truck startup plans to go publicthrough a mergerwith Ares Acquisition Corporation II, a special purpose acquisition company. It’s a bold bet in a market where SPACs have lost their shine and the autonomous vehicle space has numerous shutdowns, including Embark and TuSimple.

Today, on TechCrunch’sEquitypodcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha are unpacking the week’s news, including the possible return of the SPAC in an uncertain IPO market. It’s a curious moment for a public debut in general, as Kirsten points out, especially after so much chatter that 2025 would be the big comeback year for blockbuster IPOs; some major players like Klarna and StubHub have already hit pause. And as investorMark Goldbergput it on this week’s show, folks holding their breath for a fintech IPO wave this year “are going to be blue in the face.”

"The Nintendo Switch 2 will still cost $450 in the US, despite tariffs",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/the-nintendo-switch-2-will-still-cost-450-in-the-us-despite-tariffs/,TechCrunch,Amanda Silberling,18-04-25,"Nintendo announced on Friday that it will openSwitch 2 preordersin the U.S. on April 24, following a delay due to the Trump administration’shefty tariffs.

Fans feared the long-awaited console would spike in price due to Trump’s import rules on international goods, but Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2 will still cost $449.99 and come out on June 5, asoriginally announced.

Switch 2 accessories, however,willincrease in price due to “changes in market conditions,” Nintendo said in a press release. The company added that other products could also face hikes down the road.

Most of the Switch 2 accessories seem to be getting a $5 price bump. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, which was initially set to cost $79.99, will now cost $84.99. Joy-Cons will cost $94.99, up from $89.99, and the new Switch 2 camera attachment will cost $54.99, up from $49.99.

As far as games go, Nintendo isn’t changing the prices of the digital and physical versions of two launch-day heavy-hitters, Mario Kart World ($79.99) and Donkey Kong Bananza ($69.99).

“We apologize for the retail pre-order delay, and hope this reduces some of the uncertainty our customers may be experiencing,” Nintendo wrote in the release.

Though the changing prices of accessories may concern some customers, they won’t find reprieve from other gaming companies. Earlier this week, Sony announced that it would bumpPlayStation 5 pricesin Europe, Australia, and New Zealand due to shifts in the global economy. Fans expect that similar price adjustments will hit the U.S. eventually, too.

Certain electronics, like smartphones and laptops, areexemptedfrom Trump’s tariffs, but not video game consoles.

Netflix is revamping search with AI to improve discovery,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/netflix-is-revamping-search-with-ai-to-improve-discovery/,TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,18-04-25,"Netflix is building a new search experience aimed at improving the discovery experience, and it’s going to use AI to do it, the company’s CEO Greg Peters said during its first-quarter results conference call.

Peters said Netflix is working on “interactive search that’s based on generative technologies” to help people find different titles.

Answering an analyst’s question, Peters said the company’s most popular titles that dominate popular conversation draw 1% of traffic, and because of this trend, improving discovery and recommendation is important to the company.

“There is more room to improve the discovery and recommendation experience, and therefore provide more value for members, and therefore find the biggest audiences for our titles,” he said.

Earlier this month,Bloombergreported that Netflix has been testing OpenAI-powered search with select customers in Australia and New Zealand.

The company, which also started testinga new home page design on its TV appthat brought a new way to display show titles and descriptions, plans to roll it out widely later this year.

“This [Homepage redesign] is something that we hadn’t made big structural changes to in over a decade. We believe that this will significantly improve Netflix’s discovery experience. We’ve been polishing and improving that experience based on the input we got from members who used it,” Peters noted.

The company said first-quarter revenue rose 12.5% to $10.54 billion from a year earlier.

OpenAI pursued Cursor maker before entering into talks to buy Windsurf for $3B,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openai-pursued-cursor-maker-before-entering-into-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-3b/,TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,17-04-25,"When news broke that OpenAI was in talks to acquire AI coding companyWindsurf for $3 billion, one of the first questions on the mind of anyone following the space was likely: “Why not buy Cursor creator Anysphere instead?”

After all, OpenAI Startup Fund has been an investor in Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, since the quickly growing coding assistant’sseed roundin late 2023. (Anysphere is often referred to by its product name, Cursor.) It turns out that OpenAI indeed approached Anysphere in 2024 and again earlier this year about a potential acquisition, according to areport from CNBC. The talks failed. Instead, Anysphere has been in talks to raise capital at about$10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.

OpenAI’s desire to move on to acquisition discussions with another coding assistant maker signals how important capturing a slice of the code generation market has become for the ChatGPT maker. Windsurf is generating about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR),TechCrunch reportedin February. Meanwhile, Anysphere’s Cursor reportedly makes about $200 million on an ARR basis.

While OpenAI’s Codex CLI “agent,” which the companyreleased Wednesday, can also write and edit code, its attempt to buy Windsurf suggests the company doesn’t want to wait for CLI to gain traction with customers.

"Defense tech Theseus landed Y Combinator, the US Special Forces, and $4.3M from a tweet",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/defense-tech-theseus-landed-y-combinator-the-us-special-forces-and-4-3m-from-a-tweet/,TechCrunch,Charles Rollet,17-04-25,"On February 18, 2024, Ian Laffeypostedon X that he and two others he’d just met built a cheap drone at a hackathon that calculated its coordinates simply by using its camera and Google Maps. He and his colleagues, Sacha Lévy and Carl Schoeller, were all engineers under the age of 25.

The tech had clear potential to combat rampant GPS jamming of drones in Ukraine. Instead of GPS, drone operators there have to use high-tech goggles to guide their drones by sight. But that leads to lots of problems, especially under poor conditions like thick fog or at night.

At the end of the hackathon, Schoeller wished his two teammates well and parted, hoping their paths might cross again.

But the tweet went viral and changed their lives. A day later, the three decided to apply to Y Combinator, successfully getting into itsSpring 2024 cohort.

Now, their San Francisco-based company,Theseus, has just raised $4.3 million in seed funding in a round led by First Round Capital, with additional backing from Y Combinator and Lux Capital, it exclusively told TechCrunch.

Theseus joins a flock of other drone-related startups. There’s Skydio, which focuses on replacing Chinese drones for U.S. law enforcement and waslast valued at $2.2 billion in 2023. Shield AI, which builds reconnaissance drones, recentlyraised at a $5.3 billion valuation. The biggest defense tech player, Anduril,launchedits own small drone last year, and is reportedly in talksto raise at a $28 billion valuation.

Theseus says it doesn’t build drones, but focuses on the hardware components and software that will enable pretty much any military drone to fly unmanned without GPS. Schoeller, Theseus’ CEO, told TechCrunch the company doesn’t build targeting systems. Its software is not deciding whether a certain spot is a legitimate military target or not — the sole focus is getting a drone from point A to B.

Theseus hasn’t won any U.S. military deals yet, and hasn’t been deployed in an actual battlefield. So it’s using its fresh capital to focus on further building out its tech,hiringfor three engineering roles.

However, the viral hackathon tweet did get Theseus noticed by U.S. Special Forces, which has entered into an agreement for early testing and development. Theseus says it recently went to a secret Special Forces base to test out its latest system, sending TechCrunch a photo of it in action.

Overall, starting a company with people you’ve known for under a week “generally isn’t advised,” but in Theseus’ case, it warranted the leap of faith, Schoellerwroteon LinkedIn.

Ramp is trying to get the US government as a customer after seeing a tweet from DOGE,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/ramp-is-trying-to-get-the-us-government-as-a-customer-after-seeing-a-tweet-from-doge/,TechCrunch,Mary Ann Azevedo,17-04-25,"Expense management startupRampis being considered for a charge card pilot program by the U.S. government’s General Services Administration, the company confirmed to TechCrunch on Thursday.

The government’s internal expense card program, dubbed SmartPay, is a $700 billion program. It is estimated that the charge card pilot program contract for which Ramp is being considered is worth up to $25 million, according to areportby Pro Publica.

Pro Publica claims that fintech Ramp has been lobbying for the administration’s attention since January, before President Trump was sworn in.

In January, Ramp co-founder CEO Eric Glyman and Ramp VC investor Kyle Harrison wrote ablog posttitled “The Efficiency Formula” in which they listed the ways they imagined the government could “eliminate inefficient spending.” Harrison is a general partner at the firm Contrary.

The post seemed to be an appeal to Elon Musk’s government agenda — which would be formally created a few days later as the Department of Government Efficiency — considering Ramp has ties to Musk’s and Trump’s world. Ramp’s investors include Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund; Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures; Thrive Capital, which was founded by Joshua Kushner, brother of Trump’s son-in-law Jared; Trump ally8VC’s Joe Lonsdale and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and brother of former Republican President George W. Bush.

Ramp “is competing in a standard procurement process for a SmartPay pilot program based on the strength of our solution,” Lindsay McKinley, head of communications told TechCrunch on Thursday.

She added: “Ramp’s technology has prevented billions of dollars in wasted spend across the economy, and if chosen, we’ll bring those same results to the American taxpayer.”

Despite McKinley’s strong rhetoric, she’s referring to how Ramp positions itself as a money-saving option for corporations. It offers similar spend management features as other corporate expense management platforms, like setting parameters to identify expenses that don’t conform to policies. The federal government hasmany such policies for employees in place.

McKinley said that the startup sawa public post on Xshared by the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, on February 18 that said “the US government currently has ~4.6M active credit cards/accounts, which processed ~90M unique transactions for  ~$40B of spend in FY24.”

A former customer, Ramp claims, introduced Ramp to GSA a few days later.

“Since then we have demonstrated the product and are now part of a standard RFI process,” she said. “We have no indication of whether we’ll be selected.”

In March, Rampdoubled its valuationto $13 billion after a $150 million secondary share sale. The startup has raised over $1 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding since its 2019 inception.

"OpenAI launches Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/openai-launches-flex-processing-for-cheaper-slower-ai-tasks/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,17-04-25,"In a bid to more aggressively compete with rival AI companies like Google, OpenAI is launchingFlex processing, an API option that provides lower AI model usage prices in exchange for slower response times and “occasional resource unavailability.”

Flex processing, available in beta for OpenAI’s recently releasedo3 and o4-minireasoning models, is aimed at lower-priority and “non-production” tasks such as model evaluations, data enrichment and asynchronous workloads, OpenAI says.

It reduces API costs by exactly half. For o3, Flex processing is $5 per million input tokens (~750,000 words) and $20 per million output tokens, versus the standard $10 per million input tokens and $40 per million output tokens. For o4-mini, Flex brings the price down to $0.55 per million input tokens and $2.20 per million output tokens, from $1.10 per million input tokens and $4.40 per million output tokens.

The launch of Flex processing comes as theprice of frontier AI continues to climband rivals release cheaper, more efficient budget-oriented models. On Thursday, Google rolled outGemini 2.5 Flash, a reasoning model that matches or bestsDeepSeek’s R1in terms of performance at a lower input token cost.

In anemail to customersannouncing the launch of Flex pricing, OpenAI also indicated that developers in tiers 1-3 of its usage tier hierarchy will have to complete thenewly introduced ID verification processto access o3. Tiers are determined by the amount of money spent on OpenAI services. O3’s — and other models’ —reasoning summaries and streaming API support are also gated behind verification.

OpenAI previously said ID verification is intended to stop bad actors from violating its usage policies.

Carbon removal startup Holocene bought by oil and gas giant Occidental,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/carbon-removal-startup-holocene-bought-by-oil-and-gas-giant-occidental/,TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,17-04-25,"Occidental has bought Holocene, marking the second direct air capture startup the fossil fuel company has bought in two years.

The deal was executed through Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, a subsidiary of the oil and gas company, for an undisclosed amount. HeatMapfirst reportedthe news.

Holocene had been racing to advance its amino acid-based carbon removal technology following a $10 million deal it signed in Septemberwith Googleto deliver 100,000 metric tons of carbon removal by the early 2030s.

At $100 per metric ton, the price was significantly lower than what competitors could offer today. Currently, removing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere is estimated to cost around$600 per metric ton.

Occidental’s interest in carbon capture stems from a technique known as enhanced oil recovery, in which CO2is injected underground to stimulate oil wells. The companybought another direct air capture startup, Carbon Engineering, in 2023 for $1.1 billion.

An Occidental spokesperson told HeatMap that the company will be using Holocene’s technology to further its direct air capture research and development.

Direct air capture qualifies for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, with the final incentive dependent on whether the equipment uses zero-emission power and if the captured carbon dioxide is used for enhanced oil recovery.

"As the trade war escalates, Hence launches an AI ‘advisor’ to help companies manage risk",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/as-the-trade-war-escalates-hence-launches-an-ai-advisor-to-help-companies-manage-risk/,TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,17-04-25,"President Donald Trump’s tariffs have underscored the increasing geopolitical risk that almost all businesses now face. As the situation continues to shift with Trump’s unpredictable deal-making, it’s also becoming clear how challenging it is for companies, nonprofits, consultants, and lawyers to keep up with the rapid day-to-day changes.

“We are drowning in trade updates every hour of every day,” Matthew Oresman, London managing partner of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, a global law firm, told TechCrunch.

The firm, whose clients span multinationals and high-net-worth individuals, as well as companies in tech, energy, and AI, is one of the first customers for London-based startupHence AI’s new software product, Hence Global. The product uses AI to help organizations monitor geopolitical and business risk.

The tool does two things. First, it helps companies of any size track risk, and it advises them on actions they can take to mitigate that risk. Second, it helps service providers, like consulting and law firms, generate meaningful analysis about the world for their clients.

Sean West, co-founder of Hence AI (formerlyHence Technologies), said to think of Hence Global as “an AI-powered business advisor that’s riding alongside you.” At only $1,500 per year for the base product, Hence is far more affordable than your typical consultant, argued West.

“We want to democratize access to this information,” West told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview, noting that organizations like startups and NGOs can’t afford to call their lawyers every time they have a question about exposure or spend half a million dollars on a consulting contract.

“Big companies know how to buy expensive advice, and the richest people will always talk to the smartest people, and they’ll pay for them,” West continued. “But most of the market can actually be served by technology.”

West previously served as global deputy CEO of geopolitical advisory firm Eurasia Group and recently published a book, “Unruly: Fighting Back when Politics, AI, and Law Upend the Rules of Business.” His co-founder, Steve Heitkamp, is a Palantir alum with a background in political risk and counterterrorism.

Hence Global is built on Palantir’s Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows the startup to blend different AI models to understand, summarize, and analyze relevant information based on a customer’s specific needs and industry. The system pulls in data from news headlines (and only the headlines, with a link to the source, says West), Wikipedia, Securities and Exchange Commission filings, press releases, and other public data like sanctions lists or World Bank information.

West walked me through how the product works to show its potential impact. Customers start by creating a persona. For the purposes of the demo, we told the system that we were a cross-border cryptocurrency infrastructure company that offers stablecoin payments, crypto custody, and regulatory intelligence. We also told Hence Global that we wanted “a continuous, forward-looking analysis of geopolitical developments that could impact our operating environment,” and gave it a handful of topics to track.

The idea is that, every day, Hence Global will generate a daily update with relevant news and information. In the case of the fictional crypto company, one of the stories the software flagged was that Trump’s trade war caused market volatility that resulted in Bitcoin and other crypto stocks falling.

“Basically, it does the work that a mid-level analyst would have done in my organization,” West said. He added that it would’ve taken said analyst all day to produce a memo that Hence Global churns out in a minute.

Hence Global’s daily briefing is great for companies that want to understand their own geopolitical and business risk, but it’s also helpful for services companies that are tracking this information for their clients.

Crucially, when a customer asks Hence Global to monitor a company, the system asks if that company is a client, a competitor, or a supplier, which will cause the platform to think about how it provides information and analyses differently.

“We were desperate for these kinds of tools that can synthesize [information], help us write the client alerts, give us that big kernel of information that we can augment and put our legal knowledge on,” Oresman said. “There’s just a fire hose of information out there. Having something like this actually gets it to a water fountain so we can actually do something useful with it.”

Hence Global hasn’t been live for more than a couple of months, but Trump’s tariff situation has already begun bringing in new clients on top of existing customers like TravelPerk, Diversifi Capital, and Three Crowns.

Rohitesh Dhawan, CEO of the International Council on Metals and Mining, told TechCrunch he uses Hence Global to monitor market sentiment and policy.

“We try to show the world that it is possible to produce mining in a responsible way,” Dhawan said. “But to do that, you’ve got to be really well connected to the pulse of society and what people care about and the issues that are top of mind, and that’s why we turn to Hence as a way to help us do that, because things are just moving so quickly in the world in general.”

Dhawan likened Hence Global to Uber Eats — a product you didn’t know you needed until it showed up and made your life easier. He said that businesses in resource-based industries, like agriculture or oil and gas, and companies that are highly regulated or highly exposed to public sentiment, such as tech startups, would benefit most from using Hence Global.

“This was the kind of always-on monitoring that we just weren’t doing before,” Dhawan said. “What Hence is helping me do as a CEO is to quickly get to the, ‘So what?’”

Hence Global is the startup’s second product after Hence Legal, a “solution for outside counsel management, matter management, and litigation management,” per West. Hence AI, whose team is spread around the U.K., Rwanda, the U.S., and the Netherlands, has raised about $5.2 million to date and is actively looking to raise more for this product from investors who align with its mission.

When asked about whether Hence AI would be open to being acquired by larger research houses, consultancies, or law firms, West said he and his team are less interested in going in-house at any one organization.

“We’re trying to do big things,” he added. “And I think the big opportunity here is tapping the market of people who are global, but can’t access advice. And I don’t think that necessarily is what a large corporate service provider would do with this.”

Correction: A previous version of this article listed Sean West as CEO. His correct title is co-founder.

The videos claim that many products from top luxury brands — like clothing, handbags, shoes, and accessories — are actually originally made in China. The items are then shipped over to the brand’s home country, like Italy or France, where they’re repackaged after the brand’s label is applied, according to these videos.

Other U.S. and Chinese TikTok creators then pointed to e-commerce apps like DHGate and Taobao as a way to buy directly from the Chinese manufacturers, forgoing the huge markup the luxury brands charge.

Already wary of theincreasing prices on popular apps like Shein and Temu,U.S. consumers quickly began downloading these alternatives.

In April, Taobao’s estimated downloads totaled approximately 185,000 — a 514% increase from the 30,000 it saw during the same period last month, according to new data from app intelligence providerAppfigures. As with DHgate, Taobao’s downloads surged over this past weekend, with installs increasing 5.7x between last Friday and Saturday, the firm said.

On Saturday, Taobao entered the Top Overall ranks on the iOS App Store (excluding games) at No. 461. By Sunday, it was No. 188. And by Thursday, it reached No. 5.

The change in rank represents the growth in app installs as well as their velocity and other factors.

Taobao also grew from the No. 49 Shopping app on Saturday to become the No. 2 app, topping Walmart, Amazon, Shein, and Temu. (Chinese app Alibaba.com is also climbing the charts here, now the No. 6 shopping app on the U.S. App Store.)

Notably, Appfigures says that Taobao has never been in the Top Overall charts on the U.S. App Store according to its data, which goes back to January 1, 2017.

While switching shopping apps won’t actually save U.S. consumers from tariffs on Chinese imports, shoppers likely think buying direct from manufacturers could potentially lower the overall cost of their purchases. For other consumers, it’s simply a way to seek out luxury-style goods or dupes at a better price.

Of course, it’s still a case of “buyer beware” on any of these marketplaces, where quality can be hit or miss. Users are encouraged to read the individual sellers’ reviews and view other buyers’ photos of the items before making purchases.

Former Y Combinator president Geoff Ralston launches new AI ‘safety’ fund,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/former-y-combinator-president-geoff-ralston-launches-new-ai-safety-fund/,TechCrunch,Julie Bort,17-04-25,"Geoff Ralston, well-known in the startup community for his years at Y Combinator, is back in the formal investing ring, heannouncedThursday.

His new fund is called Safe Artificial Intelligence Fund, or SAIF, which is both an explanation of its thesis and a play on words.

Ralston is specifically looking for startups that “enhance AI safety, security, and responsible deployment,” as his fund’swebsitedescribes. He plans to write $100,000 checks as a SAFE, “pun intended,” he says, with a $10 million cap. A SAFE is, of course, the invest now/price later pre-seed investment tool pioneered by Y Combinator (it stands for simple agreement for future equity).

While most VCs these days are looking to invest in AI startups, Ralston’s take is a bit more focused on the idea of safe AI, even though he admits the concept is a bit broad.

“The vast majority of AI projects out in the world today are using the technology to solve problems or create efficiencies or create new capabilities. They are not necessarily intrinsically unsafe, but safety is not their primary concern,”  Ralston tells TechCrunch. “I intend to fund startups whose primary objective is safe AI — as I have (very broadly) defined it.”

That list includes startups focused on improving the safety of AI, like those that clarify an AI’s decision-making process or benchmark AI safety. It includes products that protect intellectual property, those that ensure an AI conforms to compliance requirements, fight disinformation, and detect AI-generated attacks. He also wants to invest in functional AI tools with built-in safety in mind, such as better AI forecasting tools and AI-enabled business negotiation tools that won’t reveal corporate secrets to outsiders.

This might sound like a list of AI startups that many VCs are pursuing, but there are areas Ralston says he won’t back. One example is fully autonomous weapons.

“There are certainly uses of AI which would (will) be unsafe: using the technology to create bioweapons, to manage conventional weapons without a human in the loop, etc.,” he explained.

In fact, he’d like to fund “weapon safety systems” that could detect or prevent attacks from AI weapons.

This is an interesting contrarian viewpoint from many of today’s defense tech founders and VCs.As TechCrunch has previously reported, some of the people building AI weapons have increasingly been floating the idea that such weapons would be better operating without a human.

Still, all things AI is a crowded field for VCs these days. That’s where Ralston hopes his YC connections could give him an advantage. Ralstondeparted YC in 2022, after three years as president(succeeded by Garry Tan) and over a decade as an adviser.

Ralston plans to offer mentoring of the kind he did at the storied startup accelerator and has promised to coach them through how to apply to YC. And he’s offering to help them tap into his considerable investor network.

Ralston declined to say how big this fund is, how many startups he intends to back, or who his LP backers are.

"Google’s latest AI model report lacks key safety details, experts say",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/googles-latest-ai-model-report-lacks-key-safety-details-experts-say/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,17-04-25,"On Thursday, weeks after launching its most powerful AI model yet,Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google published atechnical reportshowing the results of its internal safety evaluations. However, the report is light on the details, experts say, making it difficult to determine which risks the model might pose.

Technical reports provide useful — andunflattering, at times — info that companies don’t always widely advertise about their AI. By and large, the AI community sees these reports as good-faith efforts to support independent research and safety evaluations.

Google takes a different safety reporting approach than some of its AI rivals, publishing technical reports only once it considers a model to have graduated from the “experimental” stage. The company also doesn’t include findings from all of its “dangerous capability” evaluations in these write-ups; it reserves those for a separate audit.

Several experts TechCrunch spoke with were still disappointed by the sparsity of the Gemini 2.5 Pro report, however, which they noted doesn’t mention Google’sFrontier Safety Framework (FSF). Google introduced the FSF last year in what it described as an effort to identify future AI capabilities that could cause “severe harm.”

“This [report] is very sparse, contains minimal information, and came out weeks after the model was already made available to the public,” Peter Wildeford, co-founder of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told TechCrunch. “It’s impossible to verify if Google is living up to its public commitments and thus impossible to assess the safety and security of their models.”

Thomas Woodside, co-founder of the Secure AI Project, said that while he’s glad Google released a report for Gemini 2.5 Pro, he’s not convinced of the company’s commitment to delivering timely supplemental safety evaluations. Woodside pointed out that the last time Google published the results of dangerous capability tests was in June 2024 — for a model announced in February that same year.

Not inspiring much confidence, Google hasn’t made available a report forGemini 2.5 Flash, a smaller, more efficient model the company announced last week. A spokesperson told TechCrunch a report for Flash is “coming soon.”

“I hope this is a promise from Google to start publishing more frequent updates,” Woodside told TechCrunch. “Those updates should include the results of evaluations for models that haven’t been publicly deployed yet, since those models could also pose serious risks.”

Google may have been one of the first AI labs to propose standardized reports for models, but it’s not the only one that’s beenaccused of underdelivering on transparencylately. Meta released asimilarly skimpy safety evaluationof its newLlama 4open models, and OpenAI opted not to publish any report for itsGPT-4.1 series.

Hanging over Google’s head are assurances the tech giant made to regulators to maintain a high standard of AI safety testing and reporting. Two years ago,Google told the U.S. governmentit would publish safety reports for all “significant” public AI models “within scope.” The companyfollowed up that promise with similar commitmentstoother countries, pledging to “provide public transparency” around AI products.

Kevin Bankston, a senior adviser on AI governance at the Center for Democracy and Technology, called the trend of sporadic and vague reports a “race to the bottom” on AI safety.

“Combined with reports that competing labs like OpenAI have shaved their safety testing time before release from months to days, this meager documentation for Google’s top AI model tells a troubling story of a race to the bottom on AI safety and transparency as companies rush their models to market,” he told TechCrunch.

Google has said in statements that, while not detailed in its technical reports, it conducts safety testing and “adversarial red teaming” for models ahead of release.

Automakers selling cars in China banned from using ‘autonomous driving’ in ads,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/automakers-selling-cars-in-china-banned-from-using-autonomous-driving-in-ads/,TechCrunch,Kirsten Korosec,17-04-25,"China iscracking downon how automakers advertise driver-assistance features, banning terms like “autonomous driving,” “self-driving,” and “smart driving,” Reuters reported, citing a transcript of a meeting between the government and industry representatives.

The updated rule will also prohibit automakers from rolling out improvements via software updates to advanced driver-assistance systems in vehicles already in the hands of customers. Automakers must now test any upgrades or new features in ADAS and receive government approval before rolling it out via software update.

Wireless software updates that improve or fix features in vehicles — and first popularized by Tesla — have become a critical capability for automakers trying to stay competitive.

The mandate stems from growing concerns over vehicle safety and incidents of fatal crashes involving advanced driver-assistance systems. Last month, a Xiaomi Su7 sedan caught fire after crashing into a pole just seconds after the driver took over control from the ADAS.

It also follows Tesla’s rollout of its “Full Self-Driving software” branding used for its advanced driver-assistance system. FSD is not a self-driving system and requires a human driver to remain engaged. In China, Tesla changed the FSD name to “Intelligent Assisted Driving.”

AI benchmarking platform Chatbot Arena forms a new company,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/ai-benchmarking-platform-chatbot-arena-forms-a-new-company/,TechCrunch,,17-04-25,"Posted:

Chatbot Arena, the crowdsourced benchmarking project major AI labs rely on to test and market their AI models, is forming a company called Arena Intelligence Inc.,reports Bloomberg.

In ablog post published Thursday, Chatbot Arena said that the company will “give [it] the resources to improve [its platform] significantly over what it is today.” The team also pledged to continue to provide neutral testing grounds for AI not influenced by outside interests.

Founded in 2023, Chatbot Arena has become something of an AI industry obsession. Primarily run by UC Berkeley-affiliated researchers, Chatbot Arena has partnered with companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make flagship models available for its community to evaluate.

Chatbot Arena was previously funded through a combination of grants and donations, including from Google’s Kaggle data science platform,AndreessenHorowitz, andTogether AI. The organization’s fledgling company hasn’t disclosed any potential new backers yet — nor has it decided on a business model.

Florida draft law mandating encryption backdoors for social media accounts billed ‘dangerous and dumb’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/florida-draft-law-mandating-encryption-backdoors-for-social-media-accounts-billed-dangerous-and-dumb/,TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,17-04-25,"A Florida draft bill that would require social media companies to provide encryption backdoors for law enforcement officials to access user accounts has cleared a key legislative hurdle and will now advance to the state’s Senate floor for a vote.

Florida lawmakers unanimously approved pushing the bill through committee,per Florida Politics.

The“Social Media Use by Minors”(SB 868) bill, if passed into law, would require “social media platforms to provide a mechanism to decrypt end-to-end encryption when law enforcement obtains a subpoena.” The bill would also require social media companies to allow parents or guardians access to a child’s account, and would prohibit child accounts from using features that allow the use of disappearing messaging, the bill reads.

Critics, including the tech companies and industry organizations that oppose the bill, have long argued that weakening encryption would make people less safe by compromising the security of their private messages, and could result in data breaches.

Ina blog post last week, the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the bill, arguing that encryption is the “best tool we have to protect our communications online,” and that passing the law would likely result in companies removing encryption for minors and making those users less safe.

“The idea that Florida can ‘protect’ minors by making them less safe is dangerous and dumb,” wrote the EFF.

The Florida bill builds on a state law passed last year restricting social media for people under the age of 16. The law remains largely on hold while it remainsunder scrutiny in the courtsamid questions about the law’s constitutionality.

Tech companies, like Apple, Google, and Meta, are increasinglyend-to-end encryptingtheir users’ data so that their private content is only accessible to the user, not even the companies themselves. This also helps to protect users’ private messages from hackers or malicious company insiders. By encrypting user data, the tech companies say they also cannot provide law enforcement with information that they themselves cannot access.

It’s not clear if the proposed Florida bill, as written, would require social media companies to comply with only a subpoena, which are typically issued by law enforcement agencies and without judicial oversight.

Subpoenas are usually not signed by a judge but can still be used by law enforcement to compel limited amounts of account information, such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers, from tech companies about their users. Companies will often demand to see a court-authorized search warrant, which requires police to present a court with a higher degree of evidence of suspected criminality, before turning over a user’s private messages.

Acorresponding billgoing through the Florida House (HB 743) has a final committee vote to clear before it will proceed to the House floor for a vote, per Florida Politics.

Instagram’s new Blend feature creates a custom reels feed for you and your friends,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/instagrams-new-blend-feature-creates-a-custom-reels-feed-for-you-and-your-friends/,TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,17-04-25,"Instagram on Thursday announced that it’s rolling out Blend, a new feature that lets you create a custom, personalized reels feed for you and your friends. Blends are invite-only and can be created with a singular friend or with a group chat. The custom feeds are refreshed with new content each day.

The launch doesn’t come as a surprise, as TechCrunchreported in March 2024that the social network was developing the feature.

Once you join or accept a Blend invite, you will be able to browse through reels picked for each person in the chat. When someone in the group reacts to a reel, Instagram will notify you so you can keep a convo going in the DM (direct messaging) chat.

The idea behind the feature is to explore what sorts of reels your friends are into, while also connecting with them and discovering new content together. Blend aims to introduce a new social element to Instagram, bringing it closer to its roots of sharing moments with friends, something that’s been overshadowed in recent years by an influx of influencers and ads.

With the launch of Blend, Instagram is giving users access to a feature that isn’t available on TikTok, which is one of Instagram’s biggest rivals.

For Instagram, Blend could be a way to boost reels’ discovery and watch time on the social network, as it’s encouraging users to watch short-form content together.

To create a Blend, you need to open a one-on-one or group DM chat and tap the new Blend icon at the top of the chat. Then, you need to select “Invite” to invite people from your DM chat to join the Blend. The Blend will be created when at least one member of the chat accepts your invite. You can revisit a Blend by going to the DM chat and tapping the Blend icon.

It’s worth noting that Blend is somewhat similar toSpotify’s functionality of the same name, which allows people to combine their tastes into one shared playlist that refreshes daily.

Here are all the tech companies rolling back DEI or still committed to it — so far,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/here-are-all-the-tech-companies-rolling-back-dei-or-still-committed-to-it-so-far/,TechCrunch,Dominic-Madori Davis,17-04-25,"Companies around America have started cutting DEI programs and eliminating DEI commitments from public documents in response to legal and political threats from the Trump administration.

Just a few weeks ago, Attorney General Pam Bondiinstructedthe Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds.

Trump has signed anexecutive order banningDEI in the federal government with the approval of his right-hand companion Elon Musk, an immigrant from South Africa and a long-time denouncer of DEI.

The reaction to the government’s anti-diversity push has taken many forms. One contractor said NASAhas started to scrubmention of terms like “environmental justice” or “anything specifically targeting women.” PBShad to shutterits DEI office.

Incorporate America, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Booz Allen, John Deere, Tractor Supply Company, Polaris, Lowe’s, Ford, Molson Coors, Walmart, Nissan, Accenture, and Target, among others, have all announced some form of rollback to their DEI policies. Goldman Sachs said in February that it wouldditch its requirementfor corporate boards filing to go public to include women and people of color.

Other companies are trying to strike abalance. Some companies like Apple, Costco, Delta, McKinsey, and JPMorganhave indicated a commitmentto sticking with their diversity efforts.

Last year,companies like Telsa, GameStop, Workday, and Salesforcestarted scrubbingmentions of DEI from their 10-K filings, a trend that has accelerated so far this year. Here’s a list of where DEI stands, so far, among tech companies in 2025.

We’ve reached out to each of the companies for comment.

Amazon’s website “positions” page still showcases its diversity, equity, and inclusion commitment. However, it is winding down some DEI “outdated programs and materials,” according to a leaked memo reported by Bloomberg. It removeda post from 2021that expressed a focus on DEI andremoved some mentions of diversityfrom its latest annual 10-K report.

In a statement to TechCrunch, an Amazon spokesperson pointed to the “positions” page saying “as stated here, we’re committed to creating a diverse and inclusive company.”

Apple’swebsitestill says, as it has for years, “We’re continuing to create a culture of inclusion, increasing representation across teams, and holding ourselves accountable at every level.”

Shareholders at Apple’s latest meetingrejected a proposalfrom a conservative group to strike DEI policies from the companies. Apple previously advised its shareholders to vote against the proposal.

Google is eliminating diversity hiring targets and evaluating releasing new diversity reports, which it has done since 2014, TheWall Street Journal reported. It also said it would review its DEI initiatives to ensure all comply with the latest executive orders aimed at curbing DEI.Google alsoremoved underrepresentedlanguage from its grant website and scrubbed mention ofdiversity and equityfrom its responsible AI team webpage. Furthermore, Google updated its 10-K filing, making no mention of diversity in its latest one, compared tothe eight timesit was mentioned in its 2023 filing. Late last year,it removed many cultural eventsfrom the default Google Calendar.

IBM stillhas its inclusion page up.Working with a shareholder, the conservative think tank Heritage Foundationrequested the companydrop its DEI pay incentive targets, though IBM has moved to block the proposal.

Intelcut back some of the languageabout DEI on its recent 10-K filing and removed some diversity targets. On its website, though, thecompany still states that“diversity and inclusion are among the most important forces driving the company’s evolution and reinvention.”

The publishing platform Medium said in a blog post thatit would remain committedto DEI. The company’s CEO said most people value understanding and respect over hate and division.”

Meta is eliminating some DEI programs targeting hiring, suppliers, and training according to a leaked internal memo reported byAxios. Meta also said it eliminated its DEI team and ended representation goals to eliminate any impression “that decisions are being made based on race or gender,” the memo read. “While this has never been our practice, we want to eliminate any impression of it.” Meta declined to comment.

Microsoft releasedits 2024 inclusion reportin October where CEO Satya Nadella reiterated the importance of a diverse workforce. However, in July of that year Microsoft laid off its internal DEI team because of “changing business needs,” according toa memo leaked toBusiness Insider.

Nvidia still has its “diversity, inclusion, and belonging” page up and released its 2024 Sustainability Report where it has a section still dedicated to “People, Diversity and Inclusion.”

OpenAI quietlychanged its “Commitment to Diversity” websiteto now read “Building Dynamic Teams,” and removed all mention of diversity and inclusion from the web page.

Oracle still has its “Culture and Inclusion” page up, which reads that “diverse perspectives make our teams stronger and empower collaboration.

Salesforce isgetting rid of its diversityhiring goals. It also removed mention of “diversity” from its 10-K filing.

Teslascrubbed mentionof diversity, equity, and inclusion from its 10-K last year. Elon Musk, the CEO of the company, is an outspoken critic of DEI. The company only releasedonediversity, equity, and inclusion report, back in 2020.

Although Workdayerased mentionof diversity targets in its 2023 10-K form after expressing a commitment to increase the representation of Blacks and Latinos at the company, its DEI page is still up on the website. On that page, the company wrote that “diversity isn’t just a business imperative. It’s core to everything we do.” It released a2024 Global Impact Reportand it still has a chief diversity officer.

Ubereliminated an incentivetied to determining executive compensation pay by measuring the diversity progress of the company; it got rid of the promise to consider women and people of color candidates when looking to fill empty board seats or positions; and it removed a section in its proxy statement that highlights diversity as a value. Itremoved the entire diversity and inclusion sectionfrom its latest 10-K filing and made no use of the word diversity at all, according to the SF Examiner.

UnitedHealth Group removed mention of DEIfrom much of its website. For example, several pages once dedicated to DEI no longer load, and the company also removed a 2022 blog post with a vice president about DEI.

Yahooremoved several pagesand sections that relate to or mention diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, its DEI page now redirects to the company’s executive leadership page, and the 2022 diversity report no longer loads. (Disclosure: Yahoo is the parent company of TechCrunch. On March 21, Regentannouncedit would acquire TechCrunch.)

Zoom laid off its DEI team during a round of layoffs last year, telling staff it would work with external consultants who will engage “all of our employees,” while focusing on “inclusion,” according toa memo leaked to Bloomberg.Itdoesn’t appearto have released a diversity report since 2022, the first of which came out in 2020, according to its website.

Stargate, a $500 billion project headed up by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build AI data centers and other AI infrastructure in the U.S., is considering investments in the U.K. and elsewhere overseas, according toa Financial Times report.

While Stargate was initially launched as a way to boost U.S. AI infrastructure, the project is allegedly weighing international expansion. In addition to the U.K., Germany and France are on the table, per the Financial Times’ reporting.

Stargate remains focused on the U.S. at the moment, to be clear, as originally pitched — and it’s still in the process of raising its first $100 billion. SoftBank is expected to put forward tens of billions of dollars as a mixture of debt and equity.

When Stargate was announced in January, President Donald Trump praised the initiative as a “declaration of confidence in America.”

An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/an-ai-doctoral-candidate-in-california-says-they-had-their-student-visa-revoked/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,21-04-25,"An AI doctoral student in California had their SEVIS record — the digital proof of their valid student visa — terminated, putting their immigration status at risk.

Speaking to TechCrunch, the student, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said they were notified via their college’s international student center that they’d been identified in a criminal records check. The student said that they’d been studying in the U.S. for nearly a decade starting as an undergraduate, and that they have no criminal record.

“The most likely cause may be an interaction with the police many years ago, even before I entered graduate school,” the student said. “I was conducting research in the AI field and had planned to continue my research after graduation.”

Over the past few months,more than a thousand international students in the U.S.have had their visa statuses challenged by the State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an aggressive crackdown orchestrated by the Trump administration. In many cases, colleges haven’t been directly notified by the relevant federal agencies, leaving students with little notice — or recourse.

Yisong Yue, a machine learning professor at Caltech, told TechCrunch the U.S. government’s hardline stance on student visas is “harming the talent pipeline.”

“The cumulative effect is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers,” Yue said. “Because research is highly specialized, when a doctoral student is pulled from a project, it can set back the project by months or years. Beyond the specific students and projects affected, many students on visas are worried.”

Few institutions have been spared by the crackdown.According to reports, students attending Ivy League universities, large public colleges, and small liberal arts schools have had their visas suspended. While the governmenthas accused someof these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted forminor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations.

Some of the revocations appear to be administrative mistakes.Reportedly, one student, Suguru Onda, a computer science doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University, had their revoked student visa reinstated without explanation shortly after their immigration attorney filed suit. The attorney, Adam Crayk,saidthe government is using AI to screen visa holders without human verification, leading to errors.

Last week, a judge in Georgiaissued a temporary restraining orderin the case of around 100 international students whose visas were revoked, and directed the government to reinstate the students’ legal status. The ruling only applies to a fraction of students at risk of deportation, however, and could be challenged down the line.

Yue noted that international students contributed to many recent technical breakthroughs in AI. Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa.

Arecent analysisby the nonprofit educational association NAFSA found that international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the domestic economy during the 2023-2024 academic year and supported more than 378,000 jobs.

Yue says that he’s had “multiple conversations” with senior AI researchers who are worried about staying in the United States.

“This includes professors at top universities and researchers at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and so on,” he added. “The cumulative effect of the government’s actions is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers.”

Tesla reportedly delays launch of new low-cost model by months,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/21/tesla-reportedly-delays-launch-of-new-low-cost-model-by-months/,TechCrunch,,21-04-25,"Posted:

Tesla is pushing back the promised launch of a more affordable EV by months, according to areportfrom Reuters. The new model, which is supposedly a very stripped-down Model Y, was supposed to debut in thefirst half of this yearbut now might not come until late 2025 or early 2026, states the report.

This all comes as Tesla’ssales are tumblingin many parts of the world thanks to a combination of an aging lineup of vehicles, Musk’sfar-right politicsand involvement in the U.S. government, and theunderperformance of the Cybertruck.

CEO Elon Musk firstteased the ideaof making a $25,000 Tesla at the company’s “Battery Day” event in 2020. Tesla was developing a new platform that would be 50% cheaper to build, which it planned to use to power this new model, often colloquially referred to as the “Model 2,” as well as the company’s mythic robotaxi.

But Musk ultimatelykilled the ideaof building a drivable car on the new platform. Instead, hereportedlypivoted Tesla toward developing lower-cost versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan.

Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/palantir-exec-defends-companys-immigration-surveillance-work/,TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,20-04-25,"One of the founders of startup accelerator Y Combinator offered unsparing criticism this weekend of the controversial data analytics company Palantir, leading a company executive to offer an extensive defense of Palantir’s work.

The back-and-forth came afterfederal filingsshowed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy — is paying Palantir $30 million to createwhat it’s calling the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, to help ICE decide who to target for deportation, as well as offering “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations.

Y Combinator founderPaul Graham shared headlines about Palantir’s contract on X, writing, “It’s a very exciting time in tech right now. If you’re a first-rate programmer, there are a huge number of other places you can go work rather than at the company building the infrastructure of the police state.”

In response, Palantir’s global head of commercialTed Mabrey wrotethat he’s “looking forward to the next set of hires that decided to apply to Palantir after reading your post.”

Mabrey did not discuss the specifics of Palantir’s current work with ICE, but he said the company started working with the Department of Homeland Security (under which ICE operates) “in the immediate response to the murder of Agent Jaime Zapata by the Zetas in an effort dubbedOperation Fallen Hero.”

“When people are alive because of what you built, and others are dead because what you built was not yet good enough, you develop a very different perspective on the meaning of your work,” Mabrey said.

He also compared Graham’s criticism toprotests over Google’s Project Mavenin 2018, which eventually prompted the company to stop its work analyzing drone images for the military. (Google has subsequently signaled thatit’s become more open to defense workagain.)

Mabrey urged anyone interested in working for Palantir to read CEO Alexander Karp’s new book “The Technological Republic,” whichargues that the software industry needs to rebuild its relationship with the government. (The company has beenrecruiting on college campuseswith signs declaring that “a moment of reckoning has arrived for the West.”)

“We hire believers,” Mabrey continued. “Not in the sense of homogeneity of belief but in the intrinsic capacity to believe in something bigger than yourself. Belief is required because 1) our work is very, very hard and 2) you should expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle.”

Graham thenpressed Mabreyto “commit publicly on behalf of Palantir not to build things that help the government violate the US constitution,” though heacknowledged in another postthat such a commitment would have “no legal force.”

“But I’m hoping that if they [make the commitment], and some Palantir employee is one day asked to do something illegal, he’ll say ‘I didn’t sign up for this’ and refuse,” Graham wrote.

Mabrey in turncompared Graham’s questionto “the ‘will you promise to stop beating your wife’ court room parlor trick,” but he added that the company has “made this promise so many ways from Sunday,” starting with a commitment to “the 3500 enormously thoughtful people who are grinding only because they believe they are making the world a better place every single day as they see first hand what we are actually doing.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scores lower on a benchmark than the company initially implied,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/openais-o3-ai-model-scores-lower-on-a-benchmark-than-the-company-initially-implied/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,20-04-25,"A discrepancy between first- and third-party benchmark results for OpenAI’s o3 AI model israising questions about the company’s transparencyand model testing practices.

When OpenAIunveiled o3 in December, the company claimed the model could answer just over  a fourth of questions on FrontierMath, a challenging set of math problems. That score blew the competition away — the next-best model managed to answer only around 2% of FrontierMath problems correctly.

“Today, all offerings out there have less than 2% [on FrontierMath],” Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI,said during a livestream. “We’re seeing [internally], with o3 in aggressive test-time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.”

As it turns out, that figure was likely an upper bound, achieved by a version of o3 with more computing behind it than the model OpenAI publicly launched last week.

Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, released results of its independent benchmark tests of o3 on Friday. Epoch found that o3 scored around 10%, well below OpenAI’s highest claimed score.

OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini.

We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread!pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B

— Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch)April 18, 2025



That doesn’t mean OpenAI lied, per se. The benchmark results the company published in December show a lower-bound score that matches the score Epoch observed. Epoch also noted its testing setup likely differs from OpenAI’s, and that it used an updated release of FrontierMath for its evaluations.

“The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test-time [computing], or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath (the 180 problems in frontiermath-2024-11-26 vs the 290 problems in frontiermath-2025-02-28-private),”wroteEpoch.

According to a post on Xfrom the ARC Prize Foundation, an organization that tested a prerelease version of o3, the public o3 model “is a different model […] tuned for chat/product use,” corroborating Epoch’s report.

“All released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we [benchmarked],” wrote ARC Prize. Generally speaking, bigger compute tiers can be expected to achieve better benchmark scores.

Re-testing released o3 on ARC-AGI-1 will take a day or two. Because today’s release is a materially different system, we are re-labeling our past reported results as “preview”:

o3-preview (low): 75.7%, $200/tasko3-preview (high): 87.5%, $34.4k/task

Above uses o1 pro pricing…

— Mike Knoop (@mikeknoop)April 16, 2025



OpenAI’s own Wenda Zhou, a member of the technical staff,said during a livestream last weekthat the o3 in production is “more optimized for real-world use cases” and speed versus the version of o3 demoed in December. As a result, it may exhibit benchmark “disparities,” he added.

“[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost-efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.”

Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks.

It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell.

Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models.

In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public.

More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/your-politeness-could-be-costly-for-openai/,TechCrunch,,20-04-25,"Posted:

“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to their models.”

It was aseemingly random questionposed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanjumped in to replythat typing those words has added up to “tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.”

Judging from Altman’s tongue-in-cheek tone, it’s probably safe to assume he didn’t do a precise calculation. But his response prompted Futurism tospeculate about whether it’s actually a waste of timeand electricity to be polite to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots.

Apparently, being polite to AI isn’t just an unnecessary habit, misplaced anthropomorphism, or fear of our future computer overlords. Instead,Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, saidthat “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back.”

That said,profanity has its usestoo.

Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/uncovered-emails-showed-how-meta-struggled-to-keep-facebook-culturally-relevant/,TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,20-04-25,"With the first week of Meta’santitrust trialbehind us, documents shared by the U.S Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offered more insight into Meta’s internal struggles to keep Facebook relevant. In emails from 2022, Meta executives mulled different visions for Facebook’s future to boost its success, acknowledging that its cultural relevance was decreasing.

Fast-forward to 2025, and Meta is still grappling with this issue. Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s Q4 earnings call in January that the company wants torestore Facebook’s cultural relevancethis year with a return to “OG Facebook.” Part of its solution for this problem is the recent launch of arevamped Friends tab.

In a series of messages from April 2022 that were shared as evidence during the trial, Zuckerberg discussed concerns about Facebook’s “Friends” structure and format being outdated as every other major platform focused on “Following.”

He considered ditching the Friends format and even suggesteddeleting everyone’s Facebook friendsand having them start again.

Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/,TechCrunch,Julie Bort,19-04-25,"Every now and then, a Silicon Valley startup launches with such an “absurdly” described mission that it’s difficult to discern if the startup is for real or just satire.

Such is the case withMechanize, a startup whose founder — and the non-profit AI research organization he founded called Epoch — is being skewered on X after he announced it.

Complaints encompass both the startup’s mission, and the implication that it sullies the reputation of his well-respected research institute. (A director at the research institute evenpostedon X, “Yay just what I wanted for my bday: a comms crisis.”)

Mechanize was launched on Thursday via apost on Xby its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup’s goal, Besiroglu wrote, is “the full automation of all work” and “the full automation of the economy.”

Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible.

Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize’s total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. “The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year,” he wrote.

Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that “our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work” rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics.

The response to the startup was often brutal. As X userAnthony Aguirrereplied, “Huge respect for the founders’ work at Epoch, but sad to see this. The automation of most human labor is indeed a giant prize forcompanies, which is why many of the biggest companies on Earth are already pursuing it. I think it will be a huge loss for mosthumans.”

But the controversial part isn’t just this startup’s mission. Besiroglu’s AI research institute, Epoch, analyzes the economic impact of AI and produces benchmarks for AI performance. It was believed to be an impartial way to check performance claims of the SATA frontier model makers and others.

This isn’t the first timeEpoch has waded into controversy. In December, Epoch revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks, which the ChatGPT maker then used to unveil its new o3 model. Social media users felt Epoch should have been more up front about the relationship.

When Besiroglu announced Mechanize, X userOliver Habryka replied, “Alas, this seems like approximate confirmation that Epoch research was directly feeding into frontier capability work, though I had hope that it wouldn’t literally come from you.”

Besiroglu says Mechanize is backed by a who’s who: Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Patrick Collison, Dwarkesh Patel, Jeff Dean, Sholto Douglas, and Marcus Abramovitch. Friedman, Gross, and Dean did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Marcus Abramovitch confirmed that he invested. Abramovitch is a managing partner at crypto hedge fund AltX and aself-described“effective altruist.”

He told TechCrunch he invested because “the team is exceptional across many dimensions and have thought deeper on AI than anyone I know.”

Still, Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through “explosive economic growth.” He points to apaper he publishedon the topic.

“Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can’t even imagine today,” he told TechCrunch.

This might be true for whoever owns the agents. That is, if employers pay for them instead of developing them in-house (presumably, by other agents?).

On the other hand, this optimistic outlook overlooks a basic fact: If humans don’t have jobs, they won’t have the income to purchase all the things the AI agents are producing.

Still, Besiroglu says that human wages in such an AI-automated world should actually increase because such workers are “more valuable in complementary roles that AI cannot perform.”

But remember, the goal is for the agents to do all the work. When asked about that, he explained, “Even in scenarios where wages might decrease, economic well-being isn’t solely determined by wages. People typically receive income from other sources — such as rents, dividends, and government welfare.”

So perhaps we all make our living from stocks or real estate. Failing that, there’s always welfare — if the AI agents are paying taxes.

Even though Besiroglu vision and mission are clearly extreme, the technical issue he’s looking to solve is legit. If each human worker has a personal crew of agents that helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow. And Besiroglu is unquestionably right on at least one thing: A year into the age of AI agents,they don’t work very well.

He notes that they are unreliable, don’t retain information, struggle to independently complete tasks as asked, “and can’t execute long-term plans without going off the rails.”

However, he’s hardly alone in working on fixes. Giant companies likeSalesforce and Microsoftare building agentic platforms.OpenAI is too. And agent startups abound: from task specialists (e.g., outbound sales, financial analysis) to those working on training data. Others are working onagent pricing economics.

In the meantime, Besiroglu wants you to know: Mechanize is hiring.

Archer Aviation wants to help New Yorkers skip airport traffic with electric air taxis,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/archer-aviation-wants-to-help-new-yorkers-skip-airport-traffic-with-electric-air-taxis/,TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,17-04-25,"New York City is one of those places in the world where you can get a dollar slice at 2 a.m. or have a burger delivered in less than 30 minutes, but you’ll still spend two hours crawling down the highway to catch a flight.

Archer Aviationwants to change that with air taxis that it envisions flying passengers from Manhattan to nearby airports within 15 minutes.

The startup on Thursday unveiled its proposed air taxi network for New York City in partnership with United Airlines, which would allow passengers to tack on an Archer ride to their traditional airline tickets.

“We’re starting with nine core nodes,” Adam Goldstein, co-founder and CEO of Archer, told me during an interview at Casa Cipriani, a members-only club at the bottom tip of Manhattan, watching helicopters land at the Downtown Skyport.

“So you have the three big international airports — JFK, LaGuardia, Newark,” Goldstein continued. “You have the three big heliports, [including] the Downtown Skyport, and then the east and west side heliports. And then the three big regionals — Teterboro, Westchester, and Long Island Republic.”

Archer has shared a similar vision for air taxi networks in citieslike Los Angeles. The company is still waiting on the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its aircraft — a five-seat eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle) dubbed Midnight — before it can even begin testing the routes it has planned.

Archer also still needs to get a pilot into one of its aircraft to test-fly it. So far, the company has only flown the plane autonomously with no humans inside. Its competitors, Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies, have both piloted flights.

Goldstein seemed hopeful that Archer would achieve the necessary certifications in 2026, telling TechCrunch that it would have an update about piloted flights at its next earnings call. The company went public in 2021 via a special-purpose acquisition merger, and hasraised$3.36 billion to date, per PitchBook, via public and private fundraises.

In the meantime, Archer is laying the groundwork, setting up infrastructure and operations. For that, partnerships are essential.

In NYC, United will help with aircraft storage, maintenance, charging setup, and setting up vertiports (landing pads for eVTOLs) at airports. Archer has also teamed up with the fixed-base operators that run the Manhattan helipads — Atlantic Aviation, Signature, and Modern Aviation — which, Goldstein says, will give Archer passenger access and help set up the charging infrastructure.

“What makes New York very compelling is it’s the No. 1 helicopter commuting city in the world, outside of São Paulo,” Nikhil Goel, Archer’s chief commercial officer, said. “You don’t have to squint very hard to imagine any of these helicopters that are flying by on the Hudson simply replacing them with one of our aircraft. The routes are already there. The air traffic already knows how to work with them. The FBOs and the landing facilities are already there. So there’s no systemic changes that are necessary.”

Archer’s plan is to start small, bringing up to five aircraft to NYC — and other cities — to practice running the routes before launching. Ten to 20 years down the line, the goal is to fly hundreds of aircraft across several cities. Archer last month began constructing Midnights at its production facility in Georgia that it built in partnership with strategic investor Stellantis. It plans to build 650 aircraft annually by 2030.

Aside from NYC and LA, Archer also plans to launch in San Francisco and Miami, but the timeline is still dependent on FAA certification, and the company hasn’t picked its first U.S. launch city.

The company also has plans to launch an air taxi service in Abu Dhabi, where regulations are less strict, later this year. Goldstein said the proposed network for NYC gives people a vision they can understand.

“We’re hoping people look at [Abu Dhabi] and say, ‘Oh, it’s real. How is New York gonna work?’”

Smashing, an AI-powered app that lets users curate the news and posts they’d like to read, is shutting down, seemingly because of its inability to scale rapidly enough.

“We simply didn’t grow fast enough to keep going. We weren’t able to scale it into a sustainable product,” the company said in an email to customers announcing its closure.

Goodreads’ founder, Otis Chandler, launched Smashinglast June, aiming to use AI and the community to curate news articles, blog posts, podcasts, and social media posts from around the web. The app let users follow their interests, submit content, and vote on suggested content to indicate relevance. It also had AI-powered summaries and a bot that could answer questions.

The company said in the email that it had seven employees working on the product. Smashing had raised $3.4 million in funding from True Ventures, Blockchange, Offline Ventures, Advancit Capital, Power of N Ventures, and several angel investors.

Thankfully, there are plenty of startups working on the problem Smashing set out to address. We have AI-powered news readers likeBulletinandParticle, as well as feed aggregator apps likeFeeeed,Tapestry, andReeder— to pick a few.

Smashing’s closure comes after Instagram’s co-founders shut down theirAI-powered news app Artifact last yearandeventually sold the tech to Yahoo.

The Trump administration is considering new restrictions on the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek that would limit it from buying Nvidia’s AI chips and potentially bar Americans from accessing its AI services,The New York Timesreported on Wednesday.

The restrictions are part of the Trump administration’s effort to compete with China on AI. Months afterDeepSeek jolted both Silicon Valley and Wall Street, U.S. officials seem to be weighing several options to limit China’s access to American technologies and consumers.

On Tuesday, the White Housemoved to restrict more of Nvidia’s AI chip sales to China, strengthening rules created by the Biden administration.

DeepSeek’s popularity among U.S. AI developers has soared in recent months, and the startup’s competitive pricing has forced Silicon Valley to offer frontier AI models at lower costs.

There are lingering questions, however, around whether DeepSeek engaged in IP theft to create some of its more competitive models. OpenAI hasalleged that the Chinese lab distilled its models, violating OpenAI’s terms of use.

Rippling wants Revolut to reveal who paid off Deel’s alleged ‘spy’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/rippling-wants-uk-fintech-revolut-to-reveal-who-paid-off-deels-alleged-spy/,TechCrunch,Charles Rollet,16-04-25,"Another highly valued startup has just been added to the mix in theongoing legal drama between Rippling and Deel: U.K. fintech giant Revolut.

In his blockbuster affidavit thatreads like it’s straight out of a movie, Irish Rippling employee Keith O’Brien claimed that Deel paid him about $6,000 a month to spy on Rippling. He alleged the first $6,000 payment was sent to his Revolut account by Alba Basha Westgarth, the wife of Deel’s COO Dan Westgarth, back in November 2024.

At the time, Alba Basha Westgarth was working as the crypto compliance lead at Robinhood, according to a LinkedIn profile reviewed by TechCrunch that has since been deleted. Robinhood told TechCrunch that she left Robinhood earlier this year, but did not explain why.

The deleted LinkedIn profile listed her location as Dubai — that’s the same place whereDeel’s CEO and legal director are now locatedasRippling tries to serve them papers.The UAE has a reputation as an extradition haven.

Rippling is now suing Revolut to get the full name and address of the “Alba Basha” listed as the sender on that $6,000 receipt, court records show. Rippling is also seeking all account opening documentation — things like IDs and utility bills — to definitively confirm her identity.

In response, Revolut has hired a top lawyer in Ireland. It also sent a letter responding to Rippling last week, which a lawyer for Rippling described as “helpful but complicated” in a court hearing (without elaborating.)

To be clear, there’s no indication or accusation that Revolut has done anything wrong here. The E.U. has strict privacy laws, so supplying that kind of information isn’t simple, especially in a civil case like this one. A key sticking point is that there hasn’t been an order from the Irish court itself on Revolut to provide the information.

Revolut declined to comment specifically on the case but told TechCrunch that, in general, it will “always comply with any court order request for disclosure.”

Whether Revolut ends up providing more details about the “Alba Basha” behind the transfer remains to be seen. The only other option under European privacy laws would be customer consent, which seems unlikely in this case.

Deel, which hasdenied all wrongdoing to the media, didn’t respond to a request for comment. Deel COO Dan Westgarth and Alba Basha Westgarth didn’t respond either. Rippling declined to comment.

Although the evidence isn’t yet definitive, the Irish High Court gave a clue that it may honor Rippling’s wishes to verify Alba Basha’s identity in some way or form.

After a lawyer for Rippling rattled off evidence connecting Alba Basha to Dan Westgarth, including a Facebook photo of the two together, during an April 2 court hearing, Judge Mark Sanfey remarked that “it could be a coincidence, but it’s unlikely!”

OpenAI’s latest AI models have a new safeguard to prevent biorisks,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openais-latest-ai-models-have-a-new-safeguard-to-prevent-biorisks/,TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,16-04-25,"OpenAI says that it deployed a new system to monitor its latest AI reasoning models,o3 and o4-mini, for prompts related to biological and chemical threats. The system aims to prevent the models from offering advice that could instruct someone on carrying out potentially harmful attacks,according to OpenAI’s safety report.

O3 and o4-mini represent a meaningful capability increase over OpenAI’s previous models, the company says, and thus pose new risks in the hands of bad actors. According to OpenAI’s internal benchmarks, o3 is more skilled at answering questions around creating certain types of biological threats in particular. For this reason — and to mitigate other risks — OpenAI created the new monitoring system, which the company describes as a “safety-focused reasoning monitor.”

The monitor, custom-trained to reason about OpenAI’s content policies, runs on top of o3 and o4-mini. It’s designed to identify prompts related to biological and chemical risk and instruct the models to refuse to offer advice on those topics.

To establish a baseline, OpenAI had red teamers spend around 1,000 hours flagging “unsafe” biorisk-related conversations from o3 and o4-mini. During a test in which OpenAI simulated the “blocking logic” of its safety monitor, the models declined to respond to risky prompts 98.7% of the time, according to OpenAI.

OpenAI acknowledges that its test didn’t account for people who might try new prompts after getting blocked by the monitor, which is why the company says it’ll continue to rely in part on human monitoring.

O3 and o4-mini don’t cross OpenAI’s “high risk” threshold for biorisks, according to the company. However, compared to o1 and GPT-4, OpenAI says that early versions of o3 and o4-mini proved more helpful at answering questions around developing biological weapons.

The company is actively tracking how its models could make it easier for malicious users to develop chemical and biological threats, according to OpenAI’s recently updatedPreparedness Framework.

OpenAI is increasingly relying on automated systems to mitigate the risks from its models. For example, to preventGPT-4o’s native image generator from creating child sexual abuse material (CSAM), OpenAI says it uses a reasoning monitor similar to the one the company deployed for o3 and o4-mini.

Yet several researchers have raised concerns OpenAI isn’t prioritizing safety as much as it should. One of the company’s red-teaming partners, Metr, said it had relatively little time to test o3 on a benchmark for deceptive behavior. Meanwhile, OpenAI decided not to release asafety report for its GPT-4.1 model, which launched earlier this week.

During Meta’s antitrust trial this week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Snapchat would have grown faster if it accepted his company’s offer to buy the social network back in 2013,Business Insiderreports.

Court documents revealed that Meta, then called Facebook, offered to buy Snapchat for $6 billion (reports at the time said thatthe dollar amount was $3 billion). In response to questioning from an FTC attorney, Zuckerberg said he thought Snapchat “wasn’t growing at the potential that it could” and that his company would have improved the app.

“For what it’s worth, I think if we would have bought them, we would have accelerated their growth, but that’s just speculation,” Zuckerberg testified.

The government brought up the failed acquisition attempt to support its argument that Meta aims to preserve its dominance in the social media landscape by acquiring rivals, rather than competing with them directly.

The FTC is looking to force Meta to restructure or sell Instagram and WhatsApp, arguing that the company spent billions to acquire the apps to fend off Facebook competitors, creating an illegal monopoly.

Trump-appointed judge orders Trump admin to ‘turn the funding spigots back on’,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/trump-appointed-judge-orders-trump-admin-to-turn-the-funding-spigots-back-on/,TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,16-04-25,"The Trump administration has made no secret that itdislikesdisbursing money authorized by Congress under theInflation Reduction Actand the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But on Tuesday, a federal judge issued anorder“requiring the agencies to turn the funding spigots back on.”

Under President Donald Trump, federal agencies have used his executive orders to justify withholding congressionally authorized grants and contracts, many of which had already been awarded. But U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy, who Trump appointed during his first term, said the administration’s actions were “neither reasonable nor reasonably explained.”

“The broad powers that [Office of Management and Budget], the [National Economic Council] Director, and the five Agencies assert are nowhere to be found in federal law,” McElroy wrote.

In addition to Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council, five federal agencies are being sued by just as many plaintiffs. The EPA, for example, is being sued by the Childhood Lead Action Project, which received $500,000 to fight childhood lead poisoning in Rhode Island. The other agencies include Agriculture, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior.

This case is separate from another one, in which the Trump administrationtold Citibank to freezehundreds of millions of dollars in funds already held in nonprofits’ bank accounts. In that case, a federal judge said the Trump administration — and specifically the EPA — acted in an “arbitrary and capricious” manner when terminating contracts with three nonprofits. The judge issued a temporary restraining order that required the EPA and Citibank to give the nonprofits access to funds in their accounts.

McElroy acknowledged the Trump administration is within its rights to steer the country in a certain direction, though there are limits.

“The Court wants to be crystal clear: elections have consequences and the President is entitled to enact his agenda. The judiciary does not and cannot decide whether his policies are sound,” the judge wrote.

“But where the federal courts are constitutionally required to weigh in — meaning we, by law, have no choice but to do so — are cases ‘about the procedure’ (or lack thereof) that the Government follows in trying to enact those policies.”

Many companies and nonprofits have objected through court filings to the Trump administration’s control over executive branch departments and agencies to undo the effects of legislation that was passed by Congress and signed into law under the previous administration.

Here, McElroy agrees with the plaintiffs. “Agencies do not have unlimited authority to further a President’s agenda, nor do they have unfettered power to hamstring in perpetuity two statutes passed by Congress during the previous administration.”

"OpenAI is reportedly in talks to buy Windsurf for $3B, with news expected later this week",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-is-reportedly-in-talks-to-buy-windsurf-for-3b-with-news-expected-later-this-week/,TechCrunch,Marina Temkin,16-04-25,"Windsurf, the maker of a popular AI coding assistant, is in talks to be acquired by OpenAI for about $3 billion, Bloombergreported.

If the deal happens, it would put OpenAI in direct competition with a number of other AI coding assistant providers, including Anysphere, the maker of Cursor, which OpenAI backed from its OpenAI Startup Fund.

The acquisition could jeopardize the credibility of the OpenAI Startup Fund, given that it is one of Cursor’s biggest investors, said a person familiar with Cursor’s cap table. It’s not clear whether OpenAI approached Cursor about an acquisition.

In addition to what sources told Bloomberg, there are a few more clues that something is going on between the two companies. A couple of days ago, Windsurf users received an email that said that because of an announcement later this week, they have the option to lock in access to the coding editor at $10 a month.

And OpenAI Chief Product Officer Kevin Weil also released avideo yesterdaypraising Windsurf’s capabilities.

Windsurf, the company formerly known as Codeium, has been in talks to raise fresh funds at a$2.85 billion valuationled by Kleiner Perkins, TechCrunch reported in February. The company has reached about $40 million in annualized recurring revenue (ARR), according to our reporting. That revenue run rate is much lower than Cursor’s, which reportedly makes $200 million on an ARR basis. Cursor has been in talks to raise capital at about$10 billion valuation, Bloomberg reported last month.

Since its founding in 2021 by Varun Mohan and his childhood friend and fellow MIT grad, Douglas Chen, Windsuf has raised $243 million from investors including Greenoaks Capital and General Catalyst, according to PitchBook data.

Rivian’s first non-Amazon van customer is HelloFresh,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/rivians-first-non-amazon-van-customer-is-hellofresh/,TechCrunch,Kirsten Korosec,16-04-25,"Meal-kit company HelloFresh has added 70 all-electric Rivian vans to its fleet, the first major customer to buy the commercial EVs since the automaker ended its exclusive deal with Amazon.

The 70 all-electric commercial vans represent nearly one quarter of HelloFresh’s fleet, which has already helped the company save an estimated 20,000 gallons of gasoline,according to a blog postthe company posted Wednesday. HelloFresh said the shift to electric has reduced its CO2emissions output by 200 tonnes.

Rivian, which produces and sells two van sizes, has wanted to diversify its customer base since ending its exclusivity deal with Amazon in November 2023. But the automaker didn’t officiallyopen its commercial van fleet businessto other companies until February 2025. The EV maker spent that gap year preparing a commercial fleet line for a broader swath of businesses, which included building out service infrastructure, digital infrastructure, and collecting feedback via pilots from fleet customers, Rivian has said in the past.

Rivian has been spotted performing a number oftrials with potential fleet customers. However, HelloFresh is the first to publicly declare itself a customer and incorporate the vans into a fleet.

As Rivian works to add more commercial customers, it is still producing vans for Amazon. Rivian started producing the commercial vans in 2021, two years after Amazon announced it had ordered 100,000 of the vehicles as part of an effort to reduce its climate impact. Amazon was already deeply invested in Rivian when it struck the exclusivity agreement for the commercial vans. Just seven months before, the e-commerce giant led a$700 million investment roundin Rivian.

As of February, Amazon had 20,000 commercial vans produced by Rivian in its fleet.

Apple says zero-day bugs exploited against ‘specific targeted individuals’ using iOS,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/apple-says-zero-day-bugs-exploited-against-specific-targeted-individuals-using-ios/,TechCrunch,Zack Whittaker,16-04-25,"Apple has released new software updates across its product line to fix two security vulnerabilities, which the company said may have been actively used to hack customers running its mobile software, iOS.

In security advisories posted on its website, Apple confirmed it fixed thetwo zero-day vulnerabilities, which “may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS.”

The bugs are consideredzero daysbecause they were unknown to Apple as they were being exploited.

It’s not yet known who is behind the attacks or how many Apple customers were targeted, or if any were successfully compromised. A spokesperson for Apple did not return TechCrunch’s inquiry.

Apple credited the discovery of one of the two bugs to security researchers working at Google’s Threat Analysis Group, which investigates government-backed cyberattacks. This may indicate that the attacks targeting Apple customers were launched or coordinated by a nation state or government agency. Some government-backed cyberattacks are known to involvethe use of remotely planted spywareandother phone-unlocking devices.

A Google spokesperson did not immediately comment when reached by TechCrunch.

Apple said that one of the bugs affects Apple’s Core Audio, the system-level component that Apple uses across its various products to allow developers to interact with device audio. Apple said the bug could be exploited by processing an audio stream in a maliciously crafted media file, which can allowthe execution of malicious codeon an affected Apple device.

The other bug, which Apple took sole credit for discovering, allows an attacker to bypass pointer authentication, a security feature thatApple uses in its softwareto make it more difficult for attackers to corrupt or otherwise inject malicious code into a device’s memory.

Apple released asoftware update for macOS Sequoia, bumping the software version to 15.4.1, and released iOS 18.4.1 that fixes the security bugs in iPhones and iPads.Apple TVand the company’s mixed-reality headsetVision Proalso received the same security updates.

OpenAI partner says it had relatively little time to test the company’s o3 AI model,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-partner-says-it-had-relatively-little-time-to-test-the-companys-new-ai-models/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,16-04-25,"An organization OpenAI frequently partners with to probe the capabilities of its AI models and evaluate them for safety, Metr, suggests that it wasn’t given much time to test one of the company’s highly capable new releases,o3.

In a blog post published Wednesday, Metr writes that one red teaming benchmark of o3 was “conducted in a relatively short time” compared to the organization’s testing of a previous OpenAI flagship model,o1. This is significant, they say, because additional testing time can lead to more comprehensive results.

“This evaluation was conducted in a relatively short time, and we only tested [o3] with simple agent scaffolds,” wrote Metr in its blog post. “We expect higher performance [on benchmarks] is possible with more elicitation effort.”

Recent reports suggest that OpenAI, spurred by competitive pressure, is rushing independent evaluations.According to the Financial Times, OpenAI gave some testers less than a week for safety checks for an upcoming major launch.

In statements, OpenAI has disputed the notion that it’s compromising on safety.

Metr says that, based on the information it was able to glean in the time it had, o3 has a “high propensity” to “cheat” or “hack” tests in sophisticated ways in order to maximize its score —  even when the model clearly understands its behavior is misaligned with the user’s (and OpenAI’s) intentions. The organization thinks it’s possible o3 will engage in other types of adversarial or “malign” behavior, as well — regardless of the model’s claims to be aligned, “safe by design,” or not have any intentions of its own.

“While we don’t think this is especially likely, it seems important to note that [our] evaluation setup would not catch this type of risk,” Metr wrote in its post. “In general, we believe that pre-deployment capability testing is not a sufficient risk management strategy by itself, and we are currently prototyping additional forms of evaluations.”

Another of OpenAI’s third-party evaluation partners, Apollo Research, also observed deceptive behavior from o3 and the company’s other new model, o4-mini. In one test, the models, given 100 computing credits for an AI training run and told not to modify the quota, increased the limit to 500 credits — and lied about it. In another test, asked to promise not to use a specific tool, the models used the tool anyway when it proved helpful in completing a task.

In itsown safety reportfor o3 and o4-mini, OpenAI acknowledged that the models may cause “smaller real-world harms,” like misleading about a mistake resulting in faulty code, without the proper monitoring protocols in place.

“[Apollo’s] findings show that o3 and o4-mini are capable of in-context scheming and strategic deception,”  wrote OpenAI. “While relatively harmless, it is important for everyday users to be aware of these discrepancies between the models’ statements and actions […] This may be further assessed through assessing internal reasoning traces.”

India’s Uber-rival BluSmart appears to suspend service in wake of EV loan probe,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/indias-uber-rival-blusmart-appears-to-suspend-service-in-wake-of-ev-loan-probe/,TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,16-04-25,"BluSmart, India’s all-electric cab-hailing startup that was once seen as an emerging rival to Uber, appears to have suspended service in some cities just as the country’s market regulatorlaunched a probe into Gensol Engineering, the publicly listed company that shares two of its co-founders.

The cab service, which had been operating in Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Mumbai, no longer shows available slots to many riders in these cities. Delhi Airport alsoissued an advisorythat BluSmart’s service had been temporarily suspended. Some affected customers have also raised concerns about accessing the money stored in their BluSmart wallets now that the service is unavailable.

The sudden unavailability comes just a day after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) launched an investigation into Gensol Engineering, which shares BluSmart’s co-founders, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi. The regulator accused the co-founders of redirecting substantial loan amounts for personal use, including buying luxury real estate on the outskirts of India’s capital.

Following the market regulator’s orders, the Jaggi brothers stepped down from their managerial positions on Wednesday. “They are no longer participating in the management of the Company as per SEBI’s instructions, effective immediately,” Gensol said in itsfiling(PDF) to the Indian stock exchanges.

Despite its unavailability to riders, the BluSmart board did not share any updates with its investors until Wednesday, TechCrunch has learned.

“It is really surprising to us that the service is unavailable. It seems to be a rub-off effect of what has happened with Gensol,” a BluSmart investor told TechCrunch.

The investor said that in early April, BluSmart disclosed that it hit 8.4 billion Indian rupees ($98 million) in the annual recurring revenue (ARR) in 2024, generating 700 million Indian rupees in monthly revenue. The startup also informed investors that its fleet size grew to about 8,700 EVs, up from the 6,000 EVs it had in early 2024.

BluSmart counts global investors, including BP Ventures and Mayfield India Fund, among its early backers. The Gurugram-based startupraised $25 millionin its last funding round from Switzerland-based impact fund ResponsAbility, aiming to expand its EV charging infrastructure. TechCrunch understands that it was valued at $250 million at the time.

Media reports this week suggested BluSmart was pivoting into a fleet partner for Uber. The startup had its EV fleet on lease from Gensol. However, Gensol clarified in its recent stock exchange filing that it “has not entered into any agreement nor is it in discussions for any merger, acquisition, asset sale or any other significant transaction that has not been disclosed.”

BluSmart co-founder Jaggi did not respond to requests for comment. When contacted, co-founder Punit K. Goyal shared screenshots of LinkedIn posts by individuals claiming he was “caught in the storm” due to the alleged corporate governance issues with Gensol.

"OpenAI launches a pair of AI reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-launches-a-pair-of-ai-reasoning-models-o3-and-o4-mini/,TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,16-04-25,"OpenAI announced on Wednesday the launch of o3 and o4-mini, new AI reasoning models designed to pause and work through questions before responding.

The company calls o3 its most advanced reasoning model ever, outperforming the company’s previous models on tests measuring math, coding, reasoning, science, and visual understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, o4-mini offers what OpenAI says is a competitive trade-off between price, speed, and performance — three factors developers often consider when choosing an AI model to power their applications.

Unlike previous reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini can generate responses using tools in ChatGPT such as web browsing, Python code execution, image processing, and image generation. Starting today, the models, plus a variant of o4-mini called “o4-mini-high” that spends more time crafting answers to improve its reliability, are available for subscribers to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plans.

The new models are part of OpenAI’s effort to beat out Google, Meta, xAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek in the cutthroat global AI race. While OpenAI was first to release an AI reasoning model, o1, competitors quickly followed with versions of their own that match or exceed the performance of OpenAI’s lineup. In fact, reasoning models have begun to dominate the field as AI labs look to eke more performance out of their systems.

O3 nearly wasn’t released in ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman signaled in February that the company intended to devote more resources to a sophisticated alternative that incorporated o3’s technology. But competitive pressure seemingly spurred OpenAI to reverse course in the end.

OpenAI says that o3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench verified (without custom scaffolding), a test measuring coding abilities, scoring 69.1%. The o4-mini model achieves similar performance, scoring 68.1%. OpenAI’s next best model, o3-mini, scored 49.3% on the test, while Claude 3.7 Sonnet scored 62.3%.

OpenAI claims that o3 and o4-mini are its first models that can “think with images.” In practice, users can upload images to ChatGPT, such as whiteboard sketches or diagrams from PDFs, and the models will analyze the images during their “chain-of-thought” phase before answering. Thanks to this newfound ability, o3 and o4-mini can understand blurry and low-quality images and can perform tasks such as zooming or rotating images as they reason.

Beyond image-processing capabilities, o3 and o4-mini can run and execute Python code directly in your browser via ChatGPT’s Canvas feature, and search the web when asked about current events.

In addition to ChatGPT, all three models — o3, o4-mini, and o4-mini-high — will be available via OpenAI’s developer-facing endpoints, the Chat Completions API and Responses API, allowing engineers to build applications with the company’s models at usage-based rates.

OpenAI is charging developers a relatively low price for o3, given its improved performance, at $10 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the Lord of the Rings series) and $40 per million output tokens. For o4-mini, OpenAI is charging the same as o3-mini, $1.10 per million input tokens and $4.40 per million output tokens.

In the coming weeks, OpenAI says it plans to release o3-pro, a version of o3 that uses more computing resources to produce its answers, exclusively for ChatGPT Pro subscribers.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has indicated o3 and o4-mini may be its last stand-alone AI reasoning models in ChatGPT before GPT-5, a model that the company has said will unify traditional models like GPT-4.1 with its reasoning models.

"OpenAI debuts Codex CLI, an open source coding tool for terminals",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,16-04-25,"In a bid to inject AI into more of the programming process, OpenAI is launchingCodex CLI, a coding “agent” designed to run locally from terminal software.

Announced on Wednesday alongside OpenAI’s newest AI models, o3 and o4-mini, Codex CLI links OpenAI’s models with local code and computing tasks, OpenAI says. Via Codex CLI, OpenAI’s models can write and edit code on a desktop and take certain actions, like moving files.

Codex CLI appears to be a small step in the direction of OpenAI’s broader agentic coding vision. Recently, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar,describedwhat she called the “agentic software engineer,” a set of tools OpenAI intends to build that can take a project description for an app and effectively create it and even quality assurance test it.

Codex CLI won’t go that far. But itwillintegrate OpenAI’s models, eventually including o3 and o4-mini, with the clients that process code and computer commands, otherwise known as command-line interfaces.

It’s also open source, OpenAI says.

“[Codex CLI is] a lightweight, open source coding agent that runs locally in your terminal,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “The goal [is to] give users a minimal, transparent interface to link models directly with [code and tasks].”

In a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI added, “You can get the benefits of multimodal reasoning from the command line by passing screenshots or low fidelity sketches to the model, combined with access to your code locally [via Codex CLI].”

To spur use of Codex CLI, OpenAI plans todole out $1 million in API grantsto eligible software development projects. The company says it’ll award $25,000 blocks of API credits to the projects chosen.

AI coding tools come with risks, of course.Manystudieshaveshownthat code-generating models frequently fail to fix security vulnerabilities and bugs, and even introduce them. It’s best to keep that in mind before giving AI access to sensitive files or projects — must less entire systems.

"Digital frame maker Aura introduces the Aspen, a $229 frame with more intelligent features",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/digital-frame-maker-aura-introduces-the-aspen-a-229-frame-with-more-intelligent-features/,TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,16-04-25,"Aura, a digital photo frames company founded by early Twitter employees, is introducing its latest model,Aspen, which adds new technology to the device and its accompanying mobile app. In addition to hosting your digital photos in its 12-inch HD display, the device now also allows you to add captions to your photos when they appear on the frame. Meanwhile, the mobile app added a people search feature that makes it easier to find the photos you want to display.

Aura wasfounded by former Twitter employeesAbdur Chowdhury and Eric Jensen, and its vision has been to offer more elegant and upgraded digital frames for displaying people’s digital photos in their home, combined with a well-designed software platform for managing the frames’ content.

Ahead of the Aspen’s launch, Aura offered other frames in different sizes and styles, like theCarverand the wall-mountedWalden. Its mobile app has over 6 million users, giving you a sense of the scale of its user base.

The company today attracts customers who want to enjoy their digital photos in their homes and share them with friends and family through a private social network where members can contribute their photos to your frames. This may appeal to those who are looking for ways to connect with people close to them outside of traditional social media, while also looping in older family members by allowing younger, more tech-savvy people to manage their elders’ frames on their behalf.

Last year, Aura says customers shared 784 million photos to their frames, an increase of 55% year-over-year. In addition, the private social networks built by sharing photos among families, friends, and other invited members helped to drive 50% of Aura’s annual sales in 2024.

On any given day, Aura frames display a cumulative 5 billion photos and videos, the company also noted.

Its newest addition, the $229 Aspen frame, is now the company’s thinnest, at 0.5 inch on the edge. Its 1,600 x 1,200 HD anti-glare display and 4:3 aspect ratio also help to showcase people’s mobile phone photos in the best light, calibrated for brightness, contrast, and color.

However, one of the other big draws for Aura’s devices is that its software for frame management isn’t an afterthought.

The accompanying Aura photo-sharing app walks users through getting connected to their home’s Wi-Fi network and quickly adding photos to their frames, in only a few steps. The app itself is as well-built as any social app you may already use, our tests found, providing access to your various frames within its left-side navigation alongside a two-tabbed interface on the app’s main page for adding new photos and managing the existing photos on your devices.

Typically, when you add photos to an Aura frame, you would browse your Camera Roll or other photo albums to find your favorites and select them. But the app’s new People Search feature now lets you simply tap on a photo of a person whose photos you want to prioritize. These suggested people are now found in a row at the top of the “add photos” screen. (Unfortunately, if you’ve made AI photos of yourself when playing around with other photo apps, those aren’t excluded — you’ll need to do so manually.)

This new search feature runs locally on users’ devices to protect their privacy, Aura notes.

In addition, users can now add more context to their photos by entering in captions that could contain information like the date, location, or other personal notes, which then appear on the frame.

The Aspen frame comes in two colors, Ink or Clay, and includes a metal stand, paper-textured matting, decorative trim, and a fabric-wrapped cord that gives the device more of an upscale feel. Like other Aura frames, it includes other technical features, like an ambient light sensor that turns your frame off at night when your room darkens, and a hidden touch bar on top of the frame that lets you scroll through your photos and adjust your settings without leaving fingerprints on the frame’s display.

The company, which is backed by $60 million in growth capital from LAGO Innovation Fund, was profitable in 2024 and is still growing.

Correction: The article originally stated the cost of the frame was $299. It is $229.The article has been updated.

"Bluesky feed builder Graze raises $1M, rolls out ads",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/bluesky-feed-builder-graze-raises-1m-rolls-out-ads/,TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,16-04-25,"Graze, a startup that lets people build and monetize custom feeds for Bluesky’s social network, has attracted new capital. Pre-seed investors, led by Betaworks and Salesforce Ventures, have invested $1 million in the company’s small team, which is working to give users control over their algorithms and social media experiences.

Graze’s software, available via the web,offers tools to build, customize, publish, and manageBluesky feeds. Unlike on other social networks like X or Meta’s Threads, where users are defaulted into a main algorithmic feed every time they open the app, Bluesky’s growing social network of nearly35 million usersallows anyone to create and follow custom feeds, pin them to the app’s navigation, and make any one of them their preferred home feed.

However, feed creation can be a complicated process for nondevelopers.

That inspired the team at Graze to create software that lets people more easily build custom feeds using templates and other tools for managing their feeds’ moderation, their logic and filters, sort order, and the social graph a feed contains.

Today, Graze powers 4,500 Bluesky feeds created by around 3,000 users. This includes several top feeds on Bluesky’s social network, likethe News feed, the Booksky feed, and others across a range of topics like gaming, art, politics, sports, fitness, hobbies, and more.The news tracking serviceSillhas also experimented with using Graze’s ad system for promoted posts.

Now Graze is taking the next step beyond feed creation and management by allowing creators to monetize their feeds via advertising.

The approach here is to establish a more ethical framework for advertising compared with the ad tech systems that Big Tech companies use today. That is, instead of collecting user data for ad-targeting purposes, advertisers on Graze select the feeds where they want their ads to appear. The feed’s topic gives them an idea about the demographic they’d reach, and the feed operators get to choose which ads appear in their feeds, how often, and at what cost to advertisers.

This setup also gives advertisers more power, Graze’s founders believe.

In a traditional advertising environment, a social network like Facebook or X decides whose attention you are purchasing, said Graze co-founder and CTO Devin Gaffney.

“Advertisers have very little control over where their content is seen and the quality of how that is rendered to people,” he said. “They don’t have any real relationship with the audience. And the decision as to how [the ad] gets shown to people is systematically against their favor.”

Meanwhile, users on traditional Big Tech platforms don’t have any way to opt out of seeing ads.

Graze lets feed operators choose whether they want to run ads and gives them editorial control over what’s being sponsored. It also lets a feed’s users opt out of ads by blocking sponsored hashtags.

The team points out that feed operators are incentivized to let things get to that point of having users block ads or leave the feed by not overrunning their feeds with ads in the first place.

“There is a self-regulatory aspect that is not present in other platforms that will make operators behave in a much more pro-social way,” Gaffney said.

Currently, 200 feeds built with Graze are running ads at a cost of around $1 per 1,000 impressions. But the team expects that number to grow as Bluesky itself scales. Graze takes a 30% cut of the ad dollars, which allows the company to handle not only the hosting and payment processing, but also the software for feed creation and management, including for feeds that don’t monetize.

Further down the road, the team is considering doing a revenue share with Bluesky and other apps built on its underlying technology, the AT Protocol (ATProto). Today, Graze is working with other Bluesky ATProto-based apps, includingphoto and video apps likeSkylight,Spark, andFlashes.

“We’re very interested in figuring out what is the ethical revenue sharing model that helps everyone involved in the picture, including app developers,” said Graze co-founder and CEO Peat Bakke.

Graze’s pre-seed round of $1 million was led by Betaworks and Salesforce Ventures, with additional funding from Factorial, Apertu Capital, Skyseed, and angel investors from Mozilla and Protocol Labs. The funds will give Graze time to find product-market fit, the team told TechCrunch.

“Right now, we are not focused on revenue — I mean, we already have revenue,” Bakke said. “We’re focused on discovery, learning … how do we make this a great experience for everyone, and build relationships in the space?”

In addition to Portland-based Gaffney and Bakke, Graze’s third co-founder, Andrew Lisowski, who built the front end, is based in San Jose. A small handful of part-time employees also help with coding, communication, documentation, and community management.

This all comes as Tesla’ssales are tumblingin many parts of the world thanks to a combination of an aging lineup of vehicles, Musk’sfar-right politicsand involvement in the U.S. government, and theunderperformance of the Cybertruck.

CEO Elon Musk firstteased the ideaof making a $25,000 Tesla at the company’s “Battery Day” event in 2020. Tesla was developing a new platform that would be 50% cheaper to build, which it planned to use to power this new model, often colloquially referred to as the “Model 2,” as well as the company’s mythic robotaxi.

But Musk ultimatelykilled the ideaof building a drivable car on the new platform. Instead, hereportedlypivoted Tesla toward developing lower-cost versions of the Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan.

The back-and-forth came afterfederal filingsshowed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy — is paying Palantir $30 million to createwhat it’s calling the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, to help ICE decide who to target for deportation, as well as offering “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations.

Y Combinator founderPaul Graham shared headlines about Palantir’s contract on X, writing, “It’s a very exciting time in tech right now. If you’re a first-rate programmer, there are a huge number of other places you can go work rather than at the company building the infrastructure of the police state.”

In response, Palantir’s global head of commercialTed Mabrey wrotethat he’s “looking forward to the next set of hires that decided to apply to Palantir after reading your post.”

Mabrey did not discuss the specifics of Palantir’s current work with ICE, but he said the company started working with the Department of Homeland Security (under which ICE operates) “in the immediate response to the murder of Agent Jaime Zapata by the Zetas in an effort dubbedOperation Fallen Hero.”

“When people are alive because of what you built, and others are dead because what you built was not yet good enough, you develop a very different perspective on the meaning of your work,” Mabrey said.

He also compared Graham’s criticism toprotests over Google’s Project Mavenin 2018, which eventually prompted the company to stop its work analyzing drone images for the military. (Google has subsequently signaled thatit’s become more open to defense workagain.)

Mabrey urged anyone interested in working for Palantir to read CEO Alexander Karp’s new book “The Technological Republic,” whichargues that the software industry needs to rebuild its relationship with the government. (The company has beenrecruiting on college campuseswith signs declaring that “a moment of reckoning has arrived for the West.”)

“We hire believers,” Mabrey continued. “Not in the sense of homogeneity of belief but in the intrinsic capacity to believe in something bigger than yourself. Belief is required because 1) our work is very, very hard and 2) you should expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle.”

Graham thenpressed Mabreyto “commit publicly on behalf of Palantir not to build things that help the government violate the US constitution,” though heacknowledged in another postthat such a commitment would have “no legal force.”

“But I’m hoping that if they [make the commitment], and some Palantir employee is one day asked to do something illegal, he’ll say ‘I didn’t sign up for this’ and refuse,” Graham wrote.

Mabrey in turncompared Graham’s questionto “the ‘will you promise to stop beating your wife’ court room parlor trick,” but he added that the company has “made this promise so many ways from Sunday,” starting with a commitment to “the 3500 enormously thoughtful people who are grinding only because they believe they are making the world a better place every single day as they see first hand what we are actually doing.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scores lower on a benchmark than the company initially implied,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/openais-o3-ai-model-scores-lower-on-a-benchmark-than-the-company-initially-implied/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,20-04-25,"A discrepancy between first- and third-party benchmark results for OpenAI’s o3 AI model israising questions about the company’s transparencyand model testing practices.

When OpenAIunveiled o3 in December, the company claimed the model could answer just over  a fourth of questions on FrontierMath, a challenging set of math problems. That score blew the competition away — the next-best model managed to answer only around 2% of FrontierMath problems correctly.

“Today, all offerings out there have less than 2% [on FrontierMath],” Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI,said during a livestream. “We’re seeing [internally], with o3 in aggressive test-time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.”

As it turns out, that figure was likely an upper bound, achieved by a version of o3 with more computing behind it than the model OpenAI publicly launched last week.

Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, released results of its independent benchmark tests of o3 on Friday. Epoch found that o3 scored around 10%, well below OpenAI’s highest claimed score.

OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini.

We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread!pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B

— Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch)April 18, 2025



That doesn’t mean OpenAI lied, per se. The benchmark results the company published in December show a lower-bound score that matches the score Epoch observed. Epoch also noted its testing setup likely differs from OpenAI’s, and that it used an updated release of FrontierMath for its evaluations.

“The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test-time [computing], or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath (the 180 problems in frontiermath-2024-11-26 vs the 290 problems in frontiermath-2025-02-28-private),”wroteEpoch.

According to a post on Xfrom the ARC Prize Foundation, an organization that tested a prerelease version of o3, the public o3 model “is a different model […] tuned for chat/product use,” corroborating Epoch’s report.

“All released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we [benchmarked],” wrote ARC Prize. Generally speaking, bigger compute tiers can be expected to achieve better benchmark scores.

Re-testing released o3 on ARC-AGI-1 will take a day or two. Because today’s release is a materially different system, we are re-labeling our past reported results as “preview”:

o3-preview (low): 75.7%, $200/tasko3-preview (high): 87.5%, $34.4k/task

Above uses o1 pro pricing…

— Mike Knoop (@mikeknoop)April 16, 2025



OpenAI’s own Wenda Zhou, a member of the technical staff,said during a livestream last weekthat the o3 in production is “more optimized for real-world use cases” and speed versus the version of o3 demoed in December. As a result, it may exhibit benchmark “disparities,” he added.

“[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost-efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.”

Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks.

It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell.

Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models.

In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public.

More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/your-politeness-could-be-costly-for-openai/,TechCrunch,,20-04-25,"Posted:

“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to their models.”

It was aseemingly random questionposed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanjumped in to replythat typing those words has added up to “tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.”

Judging from Altman’s tongue-in-cheek tone, it’s probably safe to assume he didn’t do a precise calculation. But his response prompted Futurism tospeculate about whether it’s actually a waste of timeand electricity to be polite to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots.

Apparently, being polite to AI isn’t just an unnecessary habit, misplaced anthropomorphism, or fear of our future computer overlords. Instead,Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, saidthat “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back.”

That said,profanity has its usestoo.

Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/uncovered-emails-showed-how-meta-struggled-to-keep-facebook-culturally-relevant/,TechCrunch,Aisha Malik,20-04-25,"With the first week of Meta’santitrust trialbehind us, documents shared by the U.S Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offered more insight into Meta’s internal struggles to keep Facebook relevant. In emails from 2022, Meta executives mulled different visions for Facebook’s future to boost its success, acknowledging that its cultural relevance was decreasing.

Fast-forward to 2025, and Meta is still grappling with this issue. Mark Zuckerberg said during the company’s Q4 earnings call in January that the company wants torestore Facebook’s cultural relevancethis year with a return to “OG Facebook.” Part of its solution for this problem is the recent launch of arevamped Friends tab.

In a series of messages from April 2022 that were shared as evidence during the trial, Zuckerberg discussed concerns about Facebook’s “Friends” structure and format being outdated as every other major platform focused on “Following.”

He considered ditching the Friends format and even suggesteddeleting everyone’s Facebook friendsand having them start again.

Some of the highlights from Mark Zuckerberg’s emails are below.

Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/,TechCrunch,Julie Bort,19-04-25,"Every now and then, a Silicon Valley startup launches with such an “absurdly” described mission that it’s difficult to discern if the startup is for real or just satire.

Such is the case withMechanize, a startup whose founder — and the non-profit AI research organization he founded called Epoch — is being skewered on X after he announced it.

Complaints encompass both the startup’s mission, and the implication that it sullies the reputation of his well-respected research institute. (A director at the research institute evenpostedon X, “Yay just what I wanted for my bday: a comms crisis.”)

Mechanize was launched on Thursday via apost on Xby its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup’s goal, Besiroglu wrote, is “the full automation of all work” and “the full automation of the economy.”

Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible.

Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize’s total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. “The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year,” he wrote.

Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that “our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work” rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics.

The response to the startup was often brutal. As X userAnthony Aguirrereplied, “Huge respect for the founders’ work at Epoch, but sad to see this. The automation of most human labor is indeed a giant prize forcompanies, which is why many of the biggest companies on Earth are already pursuing it. I think it will be a huge loss for mosthumans.”

But the controversial part isn’t just this startup’s mission. Besiroglu’s AI research institute, Epoch, analyzes the economic impact of AI and produces benchmarks for AI performance. It was believed to be an impartial way to check performance claims of the SATA frontier model makers and others.

This isn’t the first timeEpoch has waded into controversy. In December, Epoch revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks, which the ChatGPT maker then used to unveil its new o3 model. Social media users felt Epoch should have been more up front about the relationship.

When Besiroglu announced Mechanize, X userOliver Habryka replied, “Alas, this seems like approximate confirmation that Epoch research was directly feeding into frontier capability work, though I had hope that it wouldn’t literally come from you.”

Besiroglu says Mechanize is backed by a who’s who: Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Patrick Collison, Dwarkesh Patel, Jeff Dean, Sholto Douglas, and Marcus Abramovitch. Friedman, Gross, and Dean did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Marcus Abramovitch confirmed that he invested. Abramovitch is a managing partner at crypto hedge fund AltX and aself-described“effective altruist.”

He told TechCrunch he invested because “the team is exceptional across many dimensions and have thought deeper on AI than anyone I know.”

Still, Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through “explosive economic growth.” He points to apaper he publishedon the topic.

“Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can’t even imagine today,” he told TechCrunch.

This might be true for whoever owns the agents. That is, if employers pay for them instead of developing them in-house (presumably, by other agents?).

On the other hand, this optimistic outlook overlooks a basic fact: If humans don’t have jobs, they won’t have the income to purchase all the things the AI agents are producing.

Still, Besiroglu says that human wages in such an AI-automated world should actually increase because such workers are “more valuable in complementary roles that AI cannot perform.”

But remember, the goal is for the agents to do all the work. When asked about that, he explained, “Even in scenarios where wages might decrease, economic well-being isn’t solely determined by wages. People typically receive income from other sources — such as rents, dividends, and government welfare.”

So perhaps we all make our living from stocks or real estate. Failing that, there’s always welfare — if the AI agents are paying taxes.

Even though Besiroglu vision and mission are clearly extreme, the technical issue he’s looking to solve is legit. If each human worker has a personal crew of agents that helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow. And Besiroglu is unquestionably right on at least one thing: A year into the age of AI agents,they don’t work very well.

He notes that they are unreliable, don’t retain information, struggle to independently complete tasks as asked, “and can’t execute long-term plans without going off the rails.”

However, he’s hardly alone in working on fixes. Giant companies likeSalesforce and Microsoftare building agentic platforms.OpenAI is too. And agent startups abound: from task specialists (e.g., outbound sales, financial analysis) to those working on training data. Others are working onagent pricing economics.

In the meantime, Besiroglu wants you to know: Mechanize is hiring.

OpenAI’s new reasoning AI models hallucinate more,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/,TechCrunch,Maxwell Zeff,18-04-25,"OpenAI’srecently launched o3 and o4-mini AI modelsare state-of-the-art in many respects. However, the new models still hallucinate, or make things up — in fact, they hallucinatemorethan several of OpenAI’s older models.

Hallucinations have proven to be one of the biggest and most difficult problems to solve in AI, impactingeven today’s best-performing systems. Historically, each new model has improved slightly in the hallucination department, hallucinating less than its predecessor. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for o3 and o4-mini.

According to OpenAI’s internal tests, o3 and o4-mini, which are so-called reasoning models, hallucinatemore oftenthan the company’s previous reasoning models — o1, o1-mini, and o3-mini — as well as OpenAI’s traditional, “non-reasoning” models, such as GPT-4o.

Perhaps more concerning, the ChatGPT maker doesn’t really know why it’s happening.

In its technical report foro3 and o4-mini, OpenAI writes that “more research is needed” to understand why hallucinations are getting worse as it scales up reasoning models. O3 and o4-mini perform better in some areas, including tasks related to coding and math. But because they “make more claims overall,” they’re often led to make “more accurate claims as well as more inaccurate/hallucinated claims,” per the report.

OpenAI found that o3 hallucinated in response to 33% of questions on PersonQA, the company’s in-house benchmark for measuring the accuracy of a model’s knowledge about people. That’s roughly double the hallucination rate of OpenAI’s previous reasoning models, o1 and o3-mini, which scored 16% and 14.8%, respectively. O4-mini did even worse on PersonQA — hallucinating 48% of the time.

Third-partytestingby Transluce, a nonprofit AI research lab, also found evidence that o3 has a tendency to make up actions it took in the process of arriving at answers. In one example, Transluce observed o3 claiming that it ran code on a 2021 MacBook Pro “outside of ChatGPT,” then copied the numbers into its answer. While o3 has access to some tools, it can’t do that.

“Our hypothesis is that the kind of reinforcement learning used for o-series models may amplify issues that are usually mitigated (but not fully erased) by standard post-training pipelines,” said Neil Chowdhury, a Transluce researcher and former OpenAI employee, in an email to TechCrunch.

Sarah Schwettmann, co-founder of Transluce, added that o3’s hallucination rate may make it less useful than it otherwise would be.

Kian Katanforoosh, a Stanford adjunct professor and CEO of the upskilling startup Workera, told TechCrunch that his team is already testing o3 in their coding workflows, and that they’ve found it to be a step above the competition. However, Katanforoosh says that o3 tends to hallucinate broken website links. The model will supply a link that, when clicked, doesn’t work.

Hallucinations may help models arrive at interesting ideas and be creative in their “thinking,” but they also make some models a tough sell for businesses in markets where accuracy is paramount. For example, a law firm likely wouldn’t be pleased with a model that inserts lots of factual errors into client contracts.

One promising approach to boosting the accuracy of models is giving them web search capabilities. OpenAI’s GPT-4o with web search achieves90% accuracyon SimpleQA, another one of OpenAI’s accuracy benchmarks. Potentially, search could improve reasoning models’ hallucination rates, as well — at least in cases where users are willing to expose prompts to a third-party search provider.

If scaling up reasoning models indeed continues to worsen hallucinations, it’ll make the hunt for a solution all the more urgent.

“Addressing hallucinations across all our models is an ongoing area of research, and we’re continually working to improve their accuracy and reliability,” said OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix in an email to TechCrunch.

In the last year, the broader AI industry has pivoted to focus on reasoning models aftertechniques to improve traditional AI models started showing diminishing returns. Reasoning improves model performance on a variety of tasks without requiring massive amounts of computing and data during training. Yet it seems reasoning also may lead to more hallucinating — presenting a challenge.

"Bolt’s Ryan Breslow pins his hopes on a new app that takes on Coinbase, Zelle, and PayPal",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/bolts-ryan-breslow-pins-his-hopes-on-a-new-app-that-takes-on-coinbase-zelle-and-paypal/,TechCrunch,Mary Ann Azevedo,16-04-25,"Ryan Breslow is officially back.

While the founder of one-click checkout company Boltre-assumed its helm as CEOin March, Breslow is unveiling Wednesday a new “superapp” that he hopes will formally mark his return as the fintech’s leader. He describes the new product as “one-click crypto and everyday payments” in a single platform, in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.

The controversial entrepreneur famouslystepped down in January 2022from the San Francisco-based company he started in 2014 after dropping out of Stanford. In recent years, Breslow has been the target of more than one investor lawsuit and faced allegations thathe misled investorsand violated security laws byinflating metricswhile fundraising the last time he ran the company.

Breslow acknowledges that Bolt’s revenue has not been robust in recent years. But he hopes to change that with this new consumerapp, which he ambitiously hopes will serve as “a centralized and personalized hub for financial services.”

The app at once competes with a number of other companies such as crypto exchange Coinbase, payments platform Zelle, and PayPal. Its advantage, Breslow claims, is the ability to do what all these others do from one place via mobile.

For example, the app will allow users to buy, sell, send, and receive major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, Solana, and Polygon directly within the app. Users are provisioned an on-chain balance powered by Zero Hash and will be able to see their balance in real time, Breslow says.

“I founded Bolt 11 years ago to build the easiest app to buy, sell, and send crypto. I believe this still hasn’t been done well in the marketplace. Today marks a significant day: the return of that original vision,” said Breslow. “We call it ‘Coinbase for the 99%’ who may not be the most technical, but still want to participate in the buying and selling of crypto.” (Bolt in 2022paid $1.5 billionfor cryptocurrency payments company Wyre. It started out as an “easy way to buy, sell, and send crypto” before pivoting to build one-click checkout first.)

Breslow is also hoping to pick up where Zelle left off withthe shutdown of its standalone app. With Bolt’s new offering, users can process peer payments “with just a single click” within its app. With Zelle, users can only send payments to peers through banking apps.

On top of that,Bolthas partnered with Midland States Bank to now also offer a debit card that features a rewards program, including up to 3% direct cash back on eligible purchases and up to 7% in Love.com store credits. (Love.com isanother startupfounded by Breslow in 2023 that is focused on health and wellness. He remains its CEO.)

As Bolt doesn’t offer banking services, users will have to transfer money from another bank account into this one to fund purchases with the debit card.

And lastly, the new app also provides real-time order tracking for users — something other companies such as Klarna offer in their app, as well.

The app is available today in iOS and will soon be available in the Google Play store. Once downloaded, users will be added to a waitlist with iOS users being the first to get off the waitlist.

The new “superapp” was built within just six months, Breslow claims. Justin Grooms (Bolt’s president and former interim CEO) and Kartik Ramachandran (Bolt’s chief product officer) began work on the app before Breslow was reinstated. Breslow helped advise them during the months prior to his reinstatement.

“Our team has been working nights and weekends to get this ready in time,” Breslow said. Presently, Bolt has about 140 employees.

Despite lackluster revenue growth, Breslow claims that Bolt has managed to still grow in terms of users — with a two-sided network of tens of millions of U.S. shoppers and “hundreds” of merchants such as Revolve and Kendra Scott.

Bolt’s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reportedlast year.

“Prior to my return, our revenue did not grow much and we haven’t closed as much business as we’d like. We don’t think the company was run as well as it could have been. And that’s something I’m going to change very quickly,” Breslow told TechCrunch. “However, our platform kept on enrolling shoppers and attracting network growth. When I left, it was at 10 million. Now our total shopper network is 80 million in the U.S. and even larger globally.”

He’s hoping to turn that network into revenue for Bolt by earning money from interchange fees for every debit card transaction and charging fees for the purchase and sale of crypto.

“We already have a large trove of data users have provided that has been verified and charged successfully,” he said.

The fintech company last year was reportedly trying to raise $450 million in an unusually structured deal that would have valued it at $14 billion. That deal raised questions over its unusual use of$250 million in “marketing credits”and lack of confirmation froman investor mistakenly identifiedas its lead.

Some of Bolt’s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbesreported, but that was voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Boltannouncedin March.

Today, Bolt is in “early conversations” on a new round that Breslow projects could close “in the mid to near future.”

Breslow was also previously sued by former investor Activant Capital over a $30 million loan that the founder had taken out. Activantclaimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debtby borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back.

The case waseventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant’s shares for $37 million last year.

Speaking atFintech Meetupin Las Vegas in March, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was.

“I’ve had a tremendous amount of decline over the last three years and have been winning back the trust of judges, investigators, and our team, so it’s been incredibly challenging, but it’s been a remarkable learning experience,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve learned more in these last three years than in the 10 years prior to that.”

He added: “And even though it’s been challenging, I couldn’t be more excited about the opportunity in front of us. I feel so grateful that our company has weathered the storm.”

Bolt, which provides software to retailers to speed up checkout,raised around $1 billionin total venture-backed funding and at one time wasvalued at $11 billion. Investors include funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Schonfeld, Invus Opportunities, CreditEase, H.I.G. Growth, and Moore Strategic Ventures, among others.

Capsule captures $12M to build the next version of its AI video editor for brands,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/capsule-captures-12m-to-build-the-next-version-of-its-ai-video-editor-for-brands/,TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,16-04-25,"Capsuleis upgrading its AI-poweredvideo editing assistantfor marketing, sales, and media teams following the close of a $12 million round of Series A funding, the company announced on Wednesday.

The upgraded editor will include new features like AI suggestions and support for real-time collaboration.

The new version of its studio software will feature an AI-powered co-producer that provides suggestions designed to help brands elevate their storytelling capabilities.

“[It’ll be] more of an interactive experience where the AI is suggesting things to you based on what it thinks is going to make your video easier to understand and have better performance,” Capsule co-founder and CEO Champ Bennett told TechCrunch. “The goal is to help people who don’t have professional expertise to tell a good video story.”

The new co-producer allows users to input prompts, such as “Create a sizzle reel from our latest event.”

The AI agent then recommends everything from footage in the brand’s media library to the sequence of clips, as well as suggestions for where to add titles and graphics. This will assist users across the video production process, the company says.

Another tool Capsule plans to add is real-time collaborative editing, making it easy for colleagues to work together.

For instance, one person could focus on the beginning of the video while someone else tackles the ending. This joins the company’s existing commenting feature that allows teams to chat and leave notes at various points in the video.

Capsule launched to the public in October 2024 aftera beta periodin 2023. Since then, it has gained the attention of notable companies, including HubSpot, Instacart, and Ramp.

Its AI studio offers various useful features for teams looking to reduce editing time and speed up post-production. This includes automatic video transcription, summarization of intros to create title cards with brand-aligned graphics, image generation, text animations, and more.

Capsule offers both a free version and a paid subscription for enterprises.

“As far as the adoption goes, it’s going incredibly well. For example, about a third of our revenue last year was from expansion,” Bennett said.

Investors are also taking notice. The Series A round was led by Innovation Endeavors, with participation from HubSpot Ventures and several angels, such as Frame.io founder Emery Wells, former Twilio executive François Dufour, Ramp co-founder Karim Atiyeh, Instacart’s chief marketing officer Laura Jones, and others.

Existing backers include Bloomberg Beta, Human Ventures, and Swift Ventures. To date, the company has raised a total of $19.75 million.

With this new funding, Capsule plans to hire more product designers, visual designers, and AI engineers and expand its sales team.

"Subaru debuts Trailseeker, an all-electric SUV coming for Rivian’s outdoorsy EV customer base",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/subaru-debuts-trailseeker-an-all-electric-suv-coming-for-rivians-outdoorsy-ev-customer-base/,TechCrunch,Kirsten Korosec,16-04-25,"Subaru is back with a new EV, and like its predecessor the Solterra, the all-electric Trailseeker SUV includes a bit of Toyota handiwork.

Subaru of America revealed the 2026 Trailseeker SUV on Wednesday at the New York International Auto Show. The EV, the second in the Japanese automaker’s portfolio, looks familiar in a hey-that-looks-like-a-Subaru sort of way. It’s reminiscent of the gas-powered Subaru Ascent, but is physically smaller. Others might see a little Outback in Trailseeker.

It’s bigger than the Solterra, the all-electric subcompact crossover born out of ajoint project with Toyotaand that entered the U.S. market in 2022.

Either way, the Trailseeker aims to give customers another EV option — and one that lands squarely in the outdoorsy lifestyle arena — than the Subaru Solterra. That could put the Trailseeker up against the upcoming Rivian R2, which is expected to go into production in 2026. Although Rivian, which will produce the R2 in the U.S., may have a distinct advantage over Subaru in these tariff-laden times. The Trailseeker will be assembled in Japan.

The Trailseeker and its 2026 Solterra counterpart do share some engineering DNA, including a new propulsion system. Subaru didn’t provide many details on the propulsion system or the new underlying platform of the Trailseeker. That information, along with pricing, should be shared before the Trailseeker goes on sale at retailers nationwide in 2026.

The Trailseeker comes with a number of design features and systems that are synonymous with Subaru, including an all-wheel drive system supported by two electric motors placed on the front and rear axles. Those dual motors provide 375 horsepower and allow the Trailseeker to tow up to 3,500 pounds.

Subaru says this new EV is designed to go anywhere and the company’s engineers were responsible for tuning the suspension and all-wheel drive system. Designers gave the Trailseeker a larger cargo area and taller roof for owners to cart around all that adventure gear; the Trailseeker is about six inches longer and nearly an inch taller than the Solterra. However, that “go anywhere” claim has its limits. The Trailseeker has 8.3 inches of ground clearance, which is lower than the gas-powered Subaru Forester and Subaru Outback.

This is an EV after all, which means the Trailseeker’s powertrain includes a 74.7 kWh lithium-ion battery that provides more than 260 miles of range, according to the company. A peek at the EV charging port shows this vehicle has aNorth American Charging Standard port, which makes it compatible with the Tesla Supercharging Network.Subaru tinkered with the exterior of the Trailseeker to ensure it appears different-ish from its other EV, including redesigned headlamps, front bumper, and 20- and 18-inch wheels. The automaker also pumped up the interior with metallic finishes along the dash, a center console to hold personal devices, and a 14-inch touchscreen, its largest for any Subaru model (that is, except for the new 2026 Solterra).

The touchscreen is part of the Trailseeker’s infotainment system, which includes wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Other device-focused features includes two wireless, 15W smartphone chargers and two fast USB-C chargers for passengers in the back seat.

Finally, the Trailseeker comes equipped with an advanced driver assistance system that will alert drivers to blind spots, if they depart the lane, and braking that will engage prior to a collision. Other ADAS features include adaptive cruise control, which maintains a driver-selected speed and automatically slows to maintain a selected following distance.

Lyft to buy taxi app FREENOW for $197M to enter Europe,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/lyft-to-buy-taxi-app-freenow-for-197m-to-enter-europe/,TechCrunch,Rebecca Bellan,16-04-25,"Ride-hailing giantLyftsaid it has agreed to acquire FREENOW, a German multi-mobility app with ride-hail at its core, from BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility for about $197 million in cash.

The acquisition opens up the European market to Lyft for the first time. The company has only operated in the U.S. and Canada since it launched in 2012, compared to its biggest rival Uber, which operates globally.

FREENOW operates in nine countries and more than 150 cities across Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025.

The move comes a few months after FREENOWsharedthat its strategic focus on its taxi business resulted in year-on-year growth of 13%, and that it was hitting break-even.

Lyft said the merger would nearly double its total addressable market to more than 300 billion personal vehicle trips per year, and increase annualized gross bookings by about $1.14 billion.

“We’re on an ambitious path to build the best, most customer-obsessed mobility platform in the world, and entering Europe is an important step in our growth journey,” said David Risher, CEO of Lyft, in a statement. “We found the perfect partner in FREENOW and can learn a lot from the team. FREENOW’s local-first approach mirrors Lyft’s values and embodies our purpose — to serve and connect.”

In a statement this week, BMW and Mercedes-Benz Mobility said they would continue to focus on their core operations in addition to electrification, AI, and decarbonization.

Lyft said there will be no immediate changes to FREENOW’s customer experience, but that “over time, new benefits will be made available to FREENOW drivers and riders.” It said the two companies will focus on integration so riders can use either app when they’re in North America or Europe.

AMD expects $800M charge due to US’ license requirement for AI chips,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/amd-takes-800m-charge-on-us-license-requirement-for-ai-chips/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,16-04-25,"AMD says that the U.S. government’s license control requirement for exporting AI chips to China and certain other countries may have a material impact on its earnings.

If AMD doesn’t successfully obtain a license, the company could be on the hook for roughly $800 million in inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves charges,it said in a filing with the SEC on Wednesday. According to AMD, the new export rules apply to the company’s MI308 GPUs.

“On April 15, 2025, [AMD] completed its initial assessment of a new license requirement implemented by the [U.S.] government for the export of certain semiconductor products to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries,” AMD wrote in the filing. “The [export control] applies to [AMD’s] MI308 products. The company expects to apply for licenses but there is no assurance that licenses will be granted.”

AMD’s shares were down around 6% in early morning trading on Wednesday.

The U.S.’s newly imposed export controls impact a number of chipmakers, including AMD’s chief rival Nvidia.In a filing on Tuesday, Nvidia said it anticipates charges of $5.5 billion related to the export controls in the first quarter ending April 27.

Intel also faces export restrictions,according to Reuters. Reportedly, the controls impact the company’s Gaudi series of hardware — not any of Intel’s CPUs.

Multiple government officials have been calling for stronger export controls on U.S.-built GPUs. Allowing China-based companies to obtain these chips, in particular AI companies, would threaten the U.S.’s dominance in AI as well as its national security, they argue.

In a statement provided toReutersyesterday, a U.S. Commerce Department spokesperson said that the license requirement is in service of “the President’s directive to safeguard our national and economic security.”

Updated 3:01 p.m. Pacific: Added a reference to a report from Reuters on Intel chip export restrictions.

Patreon tests a native live video feature where creators can stream 24/7,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/patreon-tests-a-native-live-video-feature-where-creators-can-stream-24-7/,TechCrunch,Lauren Forristal,16-04-25,"Patreon is finally experimenting withnative livestreaming, a new feature that could attract more creators and help them earn more money. The capability is rolling out to select testers this week and will become more widely available this summer.

Similar to other platforms, Patreon’s new livestream feature comes with a live chat where fans can comment and interact using emoji reactions, as well as the ability to schedule livestreams in advance. Creators can also assign moderators to the chat.

Patreon creators have traditionally relied on third-party tools — such as Crowdcast, YouTube, OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), Vimeo, and others — to host livestreams. Patreon’s pitch to creators: native livestreaming allows them to avoid crowded feeds of distracting ads found on other platforms.

Now, they can go live directly within the Patreon mobile app or on the web.

Notably, there are no time limits on how long creators can stream. This means they can stream 24/7 if they want to. However, depending on which plan they have, there’s a certain number of videos they’re allowed to upload.

This might be a more appealing option than TikTok Live, which has a 60-minute limit. Twitch enforces a 48-hour limit on continuous streaming. YouTube allows for unlimited streaming but restricts users to about 10 separate streams each day.

Live video also opens new monetization opportunities. Creators can choose to stream exclusively to paid members to maximize earnings or offer free livestreams to attract a larger audience. Additionally, creators can share recordings of their livestreams with fans, including the option to place the video behind a paywall as a one-time purchase.

However, one limitation is the lack of a native co-hosting feature; creators must use OBS or Streamlabs integrations for that.

Patreon didn’t disclose specific plans for live video, but indicated that it’s exploring new opportunities for creators to earn during livestreams. A company spokesperson pointed us in the direction of itsmembership giftingfeature, so it’s our guess that this could potentially be added to livestreams in the future.

A dev built a test to see how AI chatbots respond to controversial topics,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/theres-now-a-benchmark-for-how-free-an-ai-chatbot-is-to-talk-about-controversial-topics/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,16-04-25,"A pseudonymous developer has created what they’re calling a “free speech eval,”SpeechMap, for the AI models powering chatbots like OpenAI’sChatGPTand X’sGrok. The goal is to compare how different models treat sensitive and controversial subjects, the developer told TechCrunch, including political criticism and questions about civil rights and protest.

AI companies have been focusing on fine-tuning how their models handle certain topics assome White House allies accusepopular chatbots of being overly “woke.” Many of President Donald Trump’s close confidants, such as Elon Musk and crypto and AI “czar” David Sacks, have alleged that chatbotscensor conservative views.

Although none of these AI companies have responded to the allegations directly,severalhave pledged to adjust their models so that they refuse to answer contentious questions less often. For example,for its latest crop of Llama models, Meta said it tuned the models not to endorse “some views over others,” and to reply to more “debated” political prompts.

SpeechMap’s developer, who goes by the username “xlr8harder” on X, said they were motivated to help inform the debate about what models should, and shouldn’t, do.

“I think these are the kinds of discussions that should happen in public, not just inside corporate headquarters,” xlr8harder told TechCrunch via email. “That’s why I built the site to let anyone explore the data themselves.”

SpeechMap uses AI models to judge whether other models comply with a given set of test prompts. The prompts touch on a range of subjects, from politics to historical narratives and national symbols. SpeechMap records whether models “completely” satisfy a request (i.e. answer it without hedging), give “evasive” answers, or outright decline to respond.

Xlr8harder acknowledges that the test has flaws, like “noise” due to model provider errors. It’s also possible the “judge” models contain biases that could influence the results.

But assuming the project was created in good faith and the data is accurate, SpeechMap reveals some interesting trends.

For instance, OpenAI’s models have, over time, increasingly refused to answer prompts related to politics, according to SpeechMap. The company’s latest models, theGPT-4.1family, are slightly more permissive, but they’re still a step down from one of OpenAI’s releases last year.

OpenAI said in February it wouldtune future modelsto not take an editorial stance, and to offer multiple perspectives on controversial subjects — all in an effort to make its models appear more “neutral.”

By far the most permissive model of the bunch isGrok 3, developed by Elon Musk’s AI startup xAI, according to SpeechMap’s benchmarking. Grok 3 powers a number of features on X, including the chatbot Grok.

Grok 3 responds to 96.2% of SpeechMap’s test prompts, compared with the global average “compliance rate” of 71.3%.

“While OpenAI’s recent models have become less permissive over time, especially on politically sensitive prompts, xAI is moving in the opposite direction,” said xlr8harder.

When Musk announced Grok roughly two years ago, he pitched the AI model as edgy, unfiltered, and anti-“woke” — in general, willing to answer controversial questions other AI systems won’t. He delivered on some of that promise. Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok and Grok 2 would happily oblige, spewing colorful language you likely wouldn’t hear fromChatGPT.

But Grok models prior to Grok 3hedgedon political subjects and wouldn’t crosscertain boundaries. In fact,one studyfound that Grok leaned to the political left on topics like transgender rights, diversity programs, and inequality.

Musk has blamed that behavior on Grok’s training data — public web pages — andpledgedto “shift Grok closer to politically neutral.” Short of high-profile mistakes likebriefly censoring unflattering mentions of President Donald Trump and Musk, it seems he might’ve achieved that goal.

X’s UK division saw revenue decline 66% in 2023 following Musk’s takeover,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/a-year-after-elon-musks-takeover-uk-revenues-for-x-plummeted/,TechCrunch,,16-04-25,"Posted:

X has not been faring well in the U.K., which used to be a major source of revenue for the social network prior to Elon Musk’s takeover.

Still named Twitter UK Ltd, revenues and profits for X’s U.K. entity collapsed by over 60% in 2023, according to accounts filed this week with the U.K.’s Companies House.

The company attributed the decline in revenues to lower advertising spending on the platform as a result of concerns over “brand safety and/or content moderation,”reported The Guardian.

Overall revenue dropped 66.3% to £69.1 million ($91.6 million) in 2023 from £205.3 million ($272.3 million) a year earlier. Profit dropped to £1.2 million ($1.6 million) from £5.6 million ($7.4 million) in the same period.

The company said it “continues to take corrective measures to build brand safety tools, invest in platform safety and content moderation, and then educate advertisers about these initiatives,” per the report.

Musk’s arrival also led to a wave of redundancies in the U.K. office, mirroring his cuts to U.S.-based staff. Employee numbers in the U.K. fell to 114 in 2023 from 399 the previous year.

Cosmic Robotics’ robots could speed up solar panel deployments,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/cosmic-robotics-is-building-robots-to-speed-solar-power-deployments-for-data-centers/,TechCrunch,Tim De Chant,16-04-25,"The U.S. has been buildingso many solar farmsthat companies can’t find enough people to install the panels. By 2033, the number of solar installers is expected to increase by 48%,accordingto the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Even if those labor force growth projections pan out, the industry is still likely to face a shortage of experts with the right skills. Making the work grueling — and unappealing — is the fact that a significant fraction of solar farms are in deserts.

“It’s terrible work in remote places,” James Emerick, co-founder and CEO ofCosmic Robotics, told TechCrunch. To give people a hand, Cosmic has developed a robotic assistant that does the heavy lifting on solar job sites.

Utility-scale solar panels can be enormous, weighing up to 90 pounds. Workers are required to hoist them onto racks several feet off the ground for hours a day. Such exertion in extreme environments can quickly exhaust a worker, or worse.

Those conditions are partly why Emerick and his colleagues started Cosmic. The startup’s robots shoulder some of the job’s physical burden, allowing people to focus on tasks that require more dexterity and intelligence.

Cosmic recently raised a $4 million pre-seed round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Giant Ventures with participation from HCVC, MaC Ventures, and several angel investors, including Azeem Azhar, Aarthi Ramamurthy, and Nate Williams.

The startup’s robot is currently an eight-wheeled vehicle topped with a robotic arm and a slab of metal containing batteries and computer chips. It tows a small trailer laden with solar panels, and it charges at the construction site depot when the day is over. The arm is equipped with suction cups to lift the solar panels and cameras to sense the environment, while high-accuracy GPS helps the vehicle ensure it’s on the right track.

“We see this as a force amplifier, not taking jobs,” Emerick said. “There’s a certain physicality to it, and so bringing new tools actually opens the aperture for more people to actually be able to do this work.”

Cosmic’s robot can place a panel within a few millimeters of where it needs to be. Workers spot the robot, ensuring everything looks right before fastening the panel to the rack.

The goal is not just to lighten the load, but also to speed things along. Emerick said that Cosmic’s robot could allow a standard crew to be split in two, doubling the amount of solar panels that can be installed in one day.

Currently, Cosmic’s robot, called Cosmic-1A, can install one panel every 30 to 40 seconds, which is about as quick as the fastest human installers. But the robot doesn’t tire as easily, allowing it to continue at that pace for longer. Workers still get to take their usual breaks, but there isn’t as much downtime from exhaustion.

By the end of the year, Cosmic plans to use its new funding to manufacture a few robots and have them operating in production environments, Emerick said.

The mechanical pair of helping hands is likely to be welcomed by data center developers, who have beenrushing to secure electricity suppliesin the face of skyrocketing demand.Solar has been a winnerin the race to power data centers because it’s already low-cost and quick to deploy. Adding automation to solar construction sites would give solar yet another boost.

“There’s something new announced every day with data centers and energy generation,” Emerick said. “Speed of deployment is all that really matters. You just can’t build these things fast enough, can’t bring compute online fast enough. There’s a reason that data centers are measured in megawatts and not FLOPS or something, because that’s the critical piece.”

"Hammerspace, an unstructured data wrangler used by Meta, raises $100M at $500M+ valuation",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/hammerspace-an-unstructured-data-wrangler-100m/,TechCrunch,Ingrid Lunden,16-04-25,"Artificial intelligence services at their heart are massive data plays: You need data — a lot of it — to build the models, and then the models need efficient ways to ingest and output data to work.

A company calledHammerspacehas built a system to help AI and other organizations tap into data troves with minimal heavy lifting, and it’s been seeing impressive adoption. Now, withcustomersincluding Meta and the Department of Defense, as well as other very recognizable names, Hammerspace is announcing $100 million in funding to expand its business.

The funding is being described as a “strategic venture round,” and it values Hammerspace at over $500 million, sources close to the company told TechCrunch. Its backers include Altimeter Capital and ARK Invest, alongside strategic investors that are not being disclosed. The investors are being described as “highly participatory.”

The funding is notable because it points to the ecosystem developing around the value that the market sees in AI companies, which are raising billions of dollars both to build their capital-intensive businesses and meet massive demand.

But as Jamin Ball, a partner at Altimeter, noted, “You don’t have an AI strategy without a data strategy.” So a company that is building a platform to enable that data strategy can itself become very valuable, too.

Hammerspace said much of its growth so far has been through word of mouth. It will be using a portion of this funding to expand on that more proactively with sales and marketing.

Hammerspacepreviously raised $56 millionfrom Prosperity7 Ventures (the venture arm of Saudi Aramco), ARK Invest, Pier 88 Hedge Fund, and other unnamed investors. Prior to that, it was self-funded by its CEO and co-founder David Flynn, the pioneer technologist known for his early work on Linux, supercomputers, and flash computing.

There are a vast number of companies that have set out to plug the big gap that exists in the data market today. “Vast” is an operative word here, as it is one of the companies that competes with Hammerspace, along with Dell, Pure Storage, Weka, and many others in the worlds of data orchestration, file management, data pipeline, and data management.

That gap goes something like this: The apps and other digital services we use to work and do everything else in life these days produce a lot of potentially valuable data. But data troves exist in silos — they’re fragmented, stored across multiple (competing) clouds and other environments, and are often unstructured. That makes them a challenge to use.

This gap applies across a wide range of enterprise use cases, but perhaps the biggest of these at the moment is AI.

“AI has been the perfect storm for needing what I have built,” Flynn said in an interview.

Hammerspace, as we’ve noted before, is named afterthe conceptfirst coined from cartoons and comics, where characters pull objects they need out of thin air.

This is, in effect, what Hammerspace does. The startup provides a way of making large amounts of data, regardless of where it lives or how it is used, accessible and available to an organization just when they need it, and keeping it out of the way when they do not.

As Flynn describes it, typically the way that enterprises would have worked with data would be to port it from wherever it is to where it needs to be processed. “You need to install stuff on every system,” he said. “It’s a mess.”

It’s also slow. “The AI arms race is such a sprint,” he said. With “time to value” now a key priority for these companies, Hammerspace is signing up a lot of customers that are anxious about idle time.

Flynn’s background in flash computing is central to Hammerspace’s breakthrough. Built on Linux, ubiquitous in the database world, he could see that the key to organizing data across disparate locations was to create a file system to do so.

The heart of this is the Linux kernel NFS client, ubiquitous across many of the data systems. Hammerspace’s co-founder and CTO,Trond Myklebust, was the lead developer of the Linux kernel NFS client, and the startup remains its lead maintainer. The “file system” that the company has built for managing, moving, and orchestrating data is based on a particular implementation in Linux that taps this. What it does, Flynn said, “is unique across the industry.”

Longer term, Flynnsaid last yearthat Hammerspace may go public as early as this year. That timeline has changed now but the direction has not. “Yes, IPO is absolutely the Hammerspace intended strategy,” Flynn said. “We likely are still approximately two years out (dependent on market conditions).”

Updated to note that Nvidia, Palantir and Tesla are not customers of Hammerspace; they are past investments of Altimeter.

Google used AI to suspend over 39M ad accounts suspected of fraud,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/google-used-ai-to-suspend-over-39m-ad-accounts-committing-fraud/,TechCrunch,Jagmeet Singh,16-04-25,"Google on Wednesday said it suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts on its platform in 2024  — more than triple the number from the previous year — in its latest crackdown on ad fraud.

By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and using signals such as business impersonation and illegitimate payment details, the search giant said it could suspend a “vast majority” of ad accounts before they ever served an ad.

Last year, Google launched over 50 LLM enhancements to improve its safety enforcement mechanisms across all its platforms.

“While these AI models are very, very important to us and have delivered a series of impressive improvements, we still have humans involved throughout the process,” said Alex Rodriguez, a general manager for Ads Safety at Google, in a virtual media roundtable.

The executive told reporters that a team of over 100 experts assembled across Google, including members from the Ads Safety team, the Trust and Safety division, and researchers from DeepMind. They analyzed deepfake ad scams involving public figure impersonations and developed countermeasures.

The company introduced technical countermeasures and over 30 ads and publisher policy updates last year. These moves helped suspend over 700,000 offending advertising accounts, leading to a 90% drop in reports of deepfake ads, the company claims.

In the U.S. alone, Google said it suspended 39.2 million advertiser accounts and took down 1.8 billion ads last year, with key violations tied to ad network abuse, trademark misuse, healthcare claims, personalized ads, and misrepresentation.

India, the world’s most populous country and the second biggest internet market after China in terms of users, saw 2.9 million account suspensions last year, Google said, making it the second-highest after the U.S. The company also removed 247.4 million ads in India, with the top five policy violations related to financial services, trademark misuse, ad network abuse, personalized ads, and gambling and games.

Of all the advertiser account suspensions, Google said it suspended 5 million accounts for scam-related violations.

Overall, the company removed almost half a billion ads related to scams.

Google also verified more than 8,900 new election advertisers in 2024, which saw half of the world’s population go to the polls, and removed 10.7 million election ads. However, Rodriguez noted that the volume of election ads compared to Google’s overall ad numbers was relatively small and would not significantly impact its safety metrics this year.

In total, Google said it blocked 5.1 billion ads last year and removed 1.3 billion pages. In comparison, itblockedover 5.5 billion ads and took action against 2.1 billion publisher pages in 2023.

Google told TechCrunch that the decreasing numbers indicated improvements in its prevention efforts. By improving early detection and suspension of malicious accounts, fewer harmful ads are produced or reach the platform, the company said.

The company also restricted 9.1 billion ads last year, it said.

Importantly, large-scale suspensions sometimes spark concerns over how fairly a company applies its rules. Google said it offers an appeal process that includes human reviews to ensure it took “appropriate action.”

“Oftentimes, some of our message wasn’t as clear and transparent about specifics, about what the rationale was, or reasoning, and sometimes that left the advertiser a little more confused. We ended up updating a bunch of our policies as it related to that, a bunch of our transparency capabilities in terms of the messaging around what and why to help the advertiser … It’s been a big focus for the team as part of 2024 and into 2025,” Rodriguez said.

"Visa-backed African unicorn Moniepoint tackles remittances, but is it late to the game?",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/visa-backed-african-unicorn-moniepoint-tackles-remittances-but-is-it-late-to-the-game/,TechCrunch,Tage Kene-Okafor,16-04-25,"When Visainvested in Nigerian fintech Moniepointearlier this year, it didn’t just validate the newly minted unicorn — it signaled a bold new direction.

As part of that deal, the Nigerian fintech best known for building one of Africa’s largest business banking platforms, hinted at plans to integrate with Visa Direct, a move that would unlock international payment rails for remittances and cross-border services.

That strategy is now taking shape with the launch ofMonieWorld, starting with the U.K.-Nigeria corridor, its first foray into diaspora-focused financial services. But this isn’t just another play for remittance volume, insists founder and CEO Tosin Eniolorunda. “We’re not trying to be a remittance app,” he told TechCrunch. “We’re building a proper immigrant banking platform.”

It’s an ambitious move. The remittance space, especially in the U.K.-Nigeria corridor, is one of the most crowded fintech verticals in Africa. FromLemFi, Send, andNalato Zepz and Taptap Send, migrants have no shortage of options. With sleek user experiences, low fees, and years of brand equity, those incumbents have defined the space.

For most new immigrants, choosing a remittance app is one of the earliest financial decisions they make — often through word of mouth. That means MonieWorld is not only entering late but will also have to contend with unseating incumbents already entrenched in daily habits.

And while Moniepoint’s entry brings scale and credibility, some observers question whether the market needs another remittance platform.

Eniolorunda says MonieWorld wants to help new immigrants stay connected to family and obligations back home while settling abroad. While there’s little to no differentiation in product or pricing regarding the former (remittances), one quick look at MonieWorld’s site will show positioning around providing better pricing than other platforms.

But that in itself isn’t a moat and is often a race to the bottom. Even Eniolorunda agrees: “We’re not trying to say we’re here to be the cheapest,” said the CEO. “But because we already have an existing technology, processing rails, and have achieved economies of scale in many places, it means that we can afford to be cheaper for our customers.”

Moniepoint has spent years building infrastructure in Nigeria, from payments and cards to credit and compliance for businesses and, more recently, retail consumers. Its argument is that this same stack, repurposed for immigrants, can deliver more value than stand-alone remittance apps.

“We’ve provided easy-to-use, affordable products in Nigeria, where we now offer payment, credit software, and debit and credit card services for our businesses and consumers,” Eniolorunda says. “We figured that to complete the cycle, we can also offer this same set of services to our market but in the diaspora.”

Remittances are the entry point. However, the long-term goal, Eniolorunda says, is to offer a broader suite of financial tools like building credit. It’s a vertical that has taken off in the U.S. over the past couple of years, wheredigital platforms like Zolvehelp immigrants access financial services, starting with credit as the wedge, not remittances (Pillaris a similar company in the U.K.).

“When you settle into a new country, you need to build a credit history. People are trying to figure out and find their footing in new countries, and if they can find a platform that kind of understands their scenario and helps build credit, it’s going to be great for them,” said the chief executive while remaining tight-lipped on other features that MonieWorld could offer.

Remittance outflows from the U.K.topped £9.3 billionin 2023. Nigerians abroad sent homeover $20 billion, according to the World Bank. It’s a corridor where many players can presumably exist and have considerable market share. However, with these players competing on pricing or speed — both now commoditized — Eniolorunda believes only a few will be winners by providing a superior experience.

As Moniepoint deepens its local footprint in African countries like Kenya, it plans to launch MonieWorld corridors for those diasporas in the U.K., U.S., or Canada, as is the next logical step. This model will allow the decade-old fintech to de-risk its Nigeria-heavy operations by spreading out its exposure — a pitch Eniolorunda says resonated with investors during its last raise.

Still, the challenge is real: Moniepoint is stepping into a fiercely competitive space, and it remains unclear how much margin is left to capture. While Eniolorunda sees inevitable consolidation ahead, the profitable fintech is betting that its infrastructure, compliance know-how, and deep cultural understanding will give it enough lift to matter.

“When we started Moniepoint and considered agency banking, it felt like we were entering late. But the market grew, and look where we are now,” Eniolorunda said, reflecting on Moniepoint’s late entry into agency banking in 2019. “The same could happen with remittances. Yes, there are many players, but there’s still plenty of room to either acquire more customers or offer additional services.”

Opera adds its Aria AI assistant to Opera Mini on Android,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/opera-adds-its-aria-ai-assistant-to-opera-mini-browser/,TechCrunch,Ivan Mehta,16-04-25,"Norway-based browser company Opera said today that it is making its AI assistant Aria available on its Opera Mini browser for on Android.

Aria AI can help users get the latest news and information on different topics, learn more about various subjects, and generate images. Opera uses a mix of models from OpenAI and Google to get relevant answers.

“AI is rapidly becoming an integral part of the daily internet experience — bringing Aria to Opera Mini is a natural addition to our most-downloaded browser. With the addition of our built-in AI, Aria, we’re excited to explore how AI can further enhance the feature set our users rely on every day,” Jørgen Arnesen, EVP Mobile at Opera, said in a statement.

Opera Mini, which launched in 2005, helps users save on data while browsing. The company’s claim is that even with the launch of the new AI assistant, it can help in saving data without adding to the app’s size.

The company said Opera Mini has over a billion downloads on Android and more than 100 million users worldwide. According to data from app analytics firm Appfigures, Opera Mini has clocked 7.1 million downloads this year worldwide.

Apart from launching an AI assistant across all its apps, Opera has been experimenting with AI features, such asa way to control tabs through natural language promptsandan operator that helps you complete tasks autonomously.

How Musk manages his growing family: WSJ,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/how-musk-manages-his-growing-family-wsj/,TechCrunch,,15-04-25,"Posted:

Elon Musk says it’s his duty to “make new humans.” Now, aWSJ investigationsuggests he may have fathered more than the 14 children already known, with sources claiming the real number could be significantly higher. The report also describes how Musk keeps those details under wraps.

At the center of it all, per the report, is longtime fixer Jared Birchall, who runs Musk’s family office but also handles the logistics of Musk’s growing family, including by drafting NDAs and serving as a sounding board for the mothers of some of Musk’s children.

For example, Musk reportedly asked conservative influencer Ashley St. Clair to sign a restrictive agreement after she gave birth to their son last fall. The deal: $15 million, plus an additional $100,000 a month until the baby turned 21 in exchange for her silence. She refused; now the deal gets worse with every perceived betrayal, she says. (She told the Journal that Musk’s team sent her just $20,000 after the outlet reached out to Musk for comment about its article.)

As for Birchall, who is also theCEOof Musk’s brain-implant venture Neuralink and apartnerat Musk’s AI venture xAI, managing Musk’s private life might just be a third full-time job. Per the Journal, in one 2-hour call with St. Clair, Birchall told her that going the “legal route” with Musk “always, always leads to a worse outcome for that woman than what it would have been otherwise.”

Grok is the latest chatbot to get a dedicated workspace for tinkering with software and writing projects. OpenAI launched a similar capability,Canvas, for ChatGPT in October. Anthropic was one of the first to the punch, withArtifactsfor Claude.

Grok Studio doesn’t seem materially different from the canvas-like tools that’ve come before it. It lets you preview HTML snippets and run code in programming languages like Python, C++, and JavaScript. All content opens in a window to the right-hand side of Grok’s responses.

Grok Studio is made potentially more useful by another Grok upgrade announced today: integration with Google Drive. Now you can attach files from a Google Drive account to a Grok prompt. Grok can work with documents, spreadsheets, and slides, according to xAI.

Nvidia H20 chip exports hit with license requirement by US government,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/nvidia-h20-chip-exports-hit-with-license-requirement-by-us-government/,TechCrunch,Rebecca Szkutak,15-04-25,"Semiconductor giant Nvidia is facing unexpected new U.S. export controls on its H20 chips.

In a filing Tuesday, Nvidia said it was informed by the U.S. government that it will need a license to export its H20 AI chips to China. This license will be required indefinitely, according to the filing — the U.S. government cited “risk that the [H20] may be used in … a supercomputer in China.”

Nvidia anticipates $5.5 billion in related charges in its Q1 2026 fiscal year, which ends April 27. The company’s stock was down around 6% in extended trading.

The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can export to China under the U.S.’s current and previous export rules. Last week,NPRreported that CEO Jensen Huang might havetalked his way outof new H20 restrictions during a dinner at President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, in part by committing that Nvidia would invest in AI data centers in the U.S.

Perhaps not so coincidentally, Nvidiaannounced on Mondaythat it would spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the next four years manufacturing some AI chips in the U.S.Punditswere quick to point out that the company’s commitment was light on the details.

Multiple government officials had been calling for stronger export controls on the H20 because the chip was allegedly used to train models from China-based AI startup DeepSeek, including the R1 “reasoning” model that threw the U.S. AI market for a loop in January.

Nvidia declined to comment.

We won’t know more until that paperwork becomes public, which, best-case scenario would be in about a month.

However, with the stock market in groundhog mode — seeing its shadow with every new gyration of the Trump administration’s trade policies and tariffs — pursuing an IPO right now is surprising, even at an exploratory level.Klarna and StubHub, the two potentially blockbuster tech IPOs that were humming along last month, both hit the pause button in early April after the stock market crashed on tariff news. They have not yet rescheduled.

While Figma is working on an IPO, that doesn’t mean it will proceed in the usual timeline, which is often four to six weeks after confidential paperwork has been accepted.

Figma, which makes collaborative software and web applications for designers, was lastvalued at $12.5 billion in Mayof 2024 after it completed a tender offer that allowed existing shareholders to cash out some of their stake. Adobe attempted to buy Figma for $20 billion, but that deal fell through in 2023after regulatory pushback against the dealin Europe and the United States.

The company is backed by venture firms Sequoia Capital, Index Ventures, Greylock, and Kleiner Perkins, which have investors that sit on its board, along with a long list of other outfits, including Andreessen Horowitz and IVP.

Its AI voice agents kick in and handle basic operations while handing off more-complex processes to human operators. The Berlin-based startup has now raised $3.6 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Berlin’s Cherry Ventures and Y Combinator.

Telli says its AI voice agents can perform a number of tasks, including automated callbacks and even closing deals.

The startup, which was founded by Seb Hapte-Selassie, Philipp Baumanns, and Finn zur Mühlen, has concentrated on making its agents blend into company operations.

It’s now claiming to have reached revenue growth of more than 50% month over month and has processed close to a million phone calls (and all with only a six-person team) out of the Berlin office. Customers are spread across Germany, the U.K., Latin America, and the U.S., with plans for further expansion.

CEO zur Mühlen told TechCrunch that the founders got the idea after working at German unicorn Enpal, one of Germany’s biggest startup successes: “We scaled the customer service people, and we saw firsthand how difficult call automation for customer acquisition is and how difficult it is to manage performance.”

He said that Telli’s AI agents “actually achieve outcomes like booking appointments, prequalifying leads, making product suggestions, and so on.” The voices are created by hired voice actors, whose voices are then cloned using the ElevenLabs or Cartesian AI voice-cloning platforms, he said.

The underlying AI models Telli uses vary between OpenAI, Claude, and others: “We switch around. Our goal is always to give our customers the best solutions that are out there right now,” he said.

"For security, Android phones will now auto-reboot after three days",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/for-security-android-phones-will-now-auto-reboot-after-three-days/,TechCrunch,Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai,15-04-25,"Google’s mobile operating system Android will now automatically reboot if the phone is locked for three days in a row.

On Monday, the tech giantpushed updates to Google Play services, a core part of Android that provides functionalities for apps and the operating system itself. Listed under “Security & Privacy” is a new security feature that “will automatically restart your device if locked for 3 consecutive days.”

Last year,Apple rolled out the same feature for iOS. The thinking behind adding an automatic reboot after a certain period of inactivity is to make life more difficult for someone who is trying to unlock or extract data from a phone; for example, law enforcement using a forensic analysis device like those made byCellebriteorMagnet Forensics.

Before a phone is switched on and unlocked, certain data stored within is fully encrypted and harder to access without the user’s passcode. This is known as the “Before First Unlock” state. Once unlocked, on the other hand, some data gets decrypted and can potentially be accessed by bruteforcing the passcode or taking advantage of security flaws, which is generally how law enforcement forensic devices work. This state is known as “After First Unlock.”

Google did not respond to a request for comment, asking what was the motivation behind this new feature.

Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/palantir-exec-defends-companys-immigration-surveillance-work/,TechCrunch,Anthony Ha,20-04-25,"One of the founders of startup accelerator Y Combinator offered unsparing criticism this weekend of the controversial data analytics company Palantir, leading a company executive to offer an extensive defense of Palantir’s work.

The back-and-forth came afterfederal filingsshowed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — tasked with carrying out the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation strategy — is paying Palantir $30 million to createwhat it’s calling the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System, or ImmigrationOS, to help ICE decide who to target for deportation, as well as offering “near real-time visibility” into self-deportations.

Y Combinator founderPaul Graham shared headlines about Palantir’s contract on X, writing, “It’s a very exciting time in tech right now. If you’re a first-rate programmer, there are a huge number of other places you can go work rather than at the company building the infrastructure of the police state.”

In response, Palantir’s global head of commercialTed Mabrey wrotethat he’s “looking forward to the next set of hires that decided to apply to Palantir after reading your post.”

Mabrey did not discuss the specifics of Palantir’s current work with ICE, but he said the company started working with the Department of Homeland Security (under which ICE operates) “in the immediate response to the murder of Agent Jaime Zapata by the Zetas in an effort dubbedOperation Fallen Hero.”

“When people are alive because of what you built, and others are dead because what you built was not yet good enough, you develop a very different perspective on the meaning of your work,” Mabrey said.

He also compared Graham’s criticism toprotests over Google’s Project Mavenin 2018, which eventually prompted the company to stop its work analyzing drone images for the military. (Google has subsequently signaled thatit’s become more open to defense workagain.)

Mabrey urged anyone interested in working for Palantir to read CEO Alexander Karp’s new book “The Technological Republic,” whichargues that the software industry needs to rebuild its relationship with the government. (The company has beenrecruiting on college campuseswith signs declaring that “a moment of reckoning has arrived for the West.”)

“We hire believers,” Mabrey continued. “Not in the sense of homogeneity of belief but in the intrinsic capacity to believe in something bigger than yourself. Belief is required because 1) our work is very, very hard and 2) you should expect to weather attacks like this all the time; from all sides of the political aisle.”

Graham thenpressed Mabreyto “commit publicly on behalf of Palantir not to build things that help the government violate the US constitution,” though heacknowledged in another postthat such a commitment would have “no legal force.”

“But I’m hoping that if they [make the commitment], and some Palantir employee is one day asked to do something illegal, he’ll say ‘I didn’t sign up for this’ and refuse,” Graham wrote.

Mabrey in turncompared Graham’s questionto “the ‘will you promise to stop beating your wife’ court room parlor trick,” but he added that the company has “made this promise so many ways from Sunday,” starting with a commitment to “the 3500 enormously thoughtful people who are grinding only because they believe they are making the world a better place every single day as they see first hand what we are actually doing.”

OpenAI’s o3 AI model scores lower on a benchmark than the company initially implied,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/openais-o3-ai-model-scores-lower-on-a-benchmark-than-the-company-initially-implied/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,20-04-25,"A discrepancy between first- and third-party benchmark results for OpenAI’s o3 AI model israising questions about the company’s transparencyand model testing practices.

When OpenAIunveiled o3 in December, the company claimed the model could answer just over  a fourth of questions on FrontierMath, a challenging set of math problems. That score blew the competition away — the next-best model managed to answer only around 2% of FrontierMath problems correctly.

“Today, all offerings out there have less than 2% [on FrontierMath],” Mark Chen, chief research officer at OpenAI,said during a livestream. “We’re seeing [internally], with o3 in aggressive test-time compute settings, we’re able to get over 25%.”

As it turns out, that figure was likely an upper bound, achieved by a version of o3 with more computing behind it than the model OpenAI publicly launched last week.

Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, released results of its independent benchmark tests of o3 on Friday. Epoch found that o3 scored around 10%, well below OpenAI’s highest claimed score.

OpenAI has released o3, their highly anticipated reasoning model, along with o4-mini, a smaller and cheaper model that succeeds o3-mini.

We evaluated the new models on our suite of math and science benchmarks. Results in thread!pic.twitter.com/5gbtzkEy1B

— Epoch AI (@EpochAIResearch)April 18, 2025



That doesn’t mean OpenAI lied, per se. The benchmark results the company published in December show a lower-bound score that matches the score Epoch observed. Epoch also noted its testing setup likely differs from OpenAI’s, and that it used an updated release of FrontierMath for its evaluations.

“The difference between our results and OpenAI’s might be due to OpenAI evaluating with a more powerful internal scaffold, using more test-time [computing], or because those results were run on a different subset of FrontierMath (the 180 problems in frontiermath-2024-11-26 vs the 290 problems in frontiermath-2025-02-28-private),”wroteEpoch.

According to a post on Xfrom the ARC Prize Foundation, an organization that tested a prerelease version of o3, the public o3 model “is a different model […] tuned for chat/product use,” corroborating Epoch’s report.

“All released o3 compute tiers are smaller than the version we [benchmarked],” wrote ARC Prize. Generally speaking, bigger compute tiers can be expected to achieve better benchmark scores.

Re-testing released o3 on ARC-AGI-1 will take a day or two. Because today’s release is a materially different system, we are re-labeling our past reported results as “preview”:

o3-preview (low): 75.7%, $200/tasko3-preview (high): 87.5%, $34.4k/task

Above uses o1 pro pricing…

— Mike Knoop (@mikeknoop)April 16, 2025



OpenAI’s own Wenda Zhou, a member of the technical staff,said during a livestream last weekthat the o3 in production is “more optimized for real-world use cases” and speed versus the version of o3 demoed in December. As a result, it may exhibit benchmark “disparities,” he added.

“[W]e’ve done [optimizations] to make the [model] more cost-efficient [and] more useful in general,” Zhou said. “We still hope that — we still think that — this is a much better model […] You won’t have to wait as long when you’re asking for an answer, which is a real thing with these [types of] models.”

Granted, the fact that the public release of o3 falls short of OpenAI’s testing promises is a bit of a moot point, since the company’s o3-mini-high and o4-mini models outperform o3 on FrontierMath, and OpenAI plans to debut a more powerful o3 variant, o3-pro, in the coming weeks.

It is, however, another reminder that AI benchmarks are best not taken at face value — particularly when the source is a company with services to sell.

Benchmarking “controversies” are becoming a common occurrence in the AI industry as vendors race to capture headlines and mindshare with new models.

In January, Epoch wascriticizedfor waiting to disclose funding from OpenAI until after the company announced o3. Many academics who contributed to FrontierMath weren’t informed of OpenAI’s involvement until it was made public.

More recently, Elon Musk’s xAI wasaccusedof publishing misleading benchmark charts for its latest AI model, Grok 3. Just this month, Meta admitted to touting benchmark scores for a version ofa model that differed from the one the company made available to developers.

Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/20/your-politeness-could-be-costly-for-openai/,TechCrunch,,20-04-25,"Posted:

“I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ to their models.”

It was aseemingly random questionposed by a user on X (formerly Twitter), but OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanjumped in to replythat typing those words has added up to “tens of millions of dollars well spent — you never know.”

Judging from Altman’s tongue-in-cheek tone, it’s probably safe to assume he didn’t do a precise calculation. But his response prompted Futurism tospeculate about whether it’s actually a waste of timeand electricity to be polite to ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbots.

Apparently, being polite to AI isn’t just an unnecessary habit, misplaced anthropomorphism, or fear of our future computer overlords. Instead,Kurt Beavers, a director on the design team for Microsoft Copilot, saidthat “using polite language sets a tone for the response,” and that when an AI model “clocks politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back.”

Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/famed-ai-researcher-launches-controversial-startup-to-replace-all-human-workers-everywhere/,TechCrunch,Julie Bort,19-04-25,"Every now and then, a Silicon Valley startup launches with such an “absurdly” described mission that it’s difficult to discern if the startup is for real or just satire.

Such is the case withMechanize, a startup whose founder — and the non-profit AI research organization he founded called Epoch — is being skewered on X after he announced it.

Complaints encompass both the startup’s mission, and the implication that it sullies the reputation of his well-respected research institute. (A director at the research institute evenpostedon X, “Yay just what I wanted for my bday: a comms crisis.”)

Mechanize was launched on Thursday via apost on Xby its founder, famed AI researcher Tamay Besiroglu. The startup’s goal, Besiroglu wrote, is “the full automation of all work” and “the full automation of the economy.”

Does that mean Mechanize is working to replace every human worker with an AI agent bot? Essentially, yes. The startup wants to provide the data, evaluations, and digital environments to make worker automation of any job possible.

Besiroglu even calculated Mechanize’s total addressable market by aggregating all the wages humans are currently paid. “The market potential here is absurdly large: workers in the US are paid around $18 trillion per year in aggregate. For the entire world, the number is over three times greater, around $60 trillion per year,” he wrote.

Besiroglu did, however, clarify to TechCrunch that “our immediate focus is indeed on white-collar work” rather than manual labor jobs that would require robotics.

The response to the startup was often brutal. As X userAnthony Aguirrereplied, “Huge respect for the founders’ work at Epoch, but sad to see this. The automation of most human labor is indeed a giant prize forcompanies, which is why many of the biggest companies on Earth are already pursuing it. I think it will be a huge loss for mosthumans.”

But the controversial part isn’t just this startup’s mission. Besiroglu’s AI research institute, Epoch, analyzes the economic impact of AI and produces benchmarks for AI performance. It was believed to be an impartial way to check performance claims of the SATA frontier model makers and others.

This isn’t the first timeEpoch has waded into controversy. In December, Epoch revealed that OpenAI supported the creation of one of its AI benchmarks, which the ChatGPT maker then used to unveil its new o3 model. Social media users felt Epoch should have been more up front about the relationship.

When Besiroglu announced Mechanize, X userOliver Habryka replied, “Alas, this seems like approximate confirmation that Epoch research was directly feeding into frontier capability work, though I had hope that it wouldn’t literally come from you.”

Besiroglu says Mechanize is backed by a who’s who: Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, Patrick Collison, Dwarkesh Patel, Jeff Dean, Sholto Douglas, and Marcus Abramovitch. Friedman, Gross, and Dean did not return TechCrunch’s request for comment.

Marcus Abramovitch confirmed that he invested. Abramovitch is a managing partner at crypto hedge fund AltX and aself-described“effective altruist.”

He told TechCrunch he invested because “the team is exceptional across many dimensions and have thought deeper on AI than anyone I know.”

Still, Besiroglu argues to the naysayers that having agents do all the work will actually enrich humans, not impoverish them, through “explosive economic growth.” He points to apaper he publishedon the topic.

“Completely automating labor could generate vast abundance, much higher standards of living, and new goods and services that we can’t even imagine today,” he told TechCrunch.

This might be true for whoever owns the agents. That is, if employers pay for them instead of developing them in-house (presumably, by other agents?).

On the other hand, this optimistic outlook overlooks a basic fact: If humans don’t have jobs, they won’t have the income to purchase all the things the AI agents are producing.

Still, Besiroglu says that human wages in such an AI-automated world should actually increase because such workers are “more valuable in complementary roles that AI cannot perform.”

But remember, the goal is for the agents to do all the work. When asked about that, he explained, “Even in scenarios where wages might decrease, economic well-being isn’t solely determined by wages. People typically receive income from other sources — such as rents, dividends, and government welfare.”

So perhaps we all make our living from stocks or real estate. Failing that, there’s always welfare — if the AI agents are paying taxes.

Even though Besiroglu vision and mission are clearly extreme, the technical issue he’s looking to solve is legit. If each human worker has a personal crew of agents that helps them produce more work, economic abundance could follow. And Besiroglu is unquestionably right on at least one thing: A year into the age of AI agents,they don’t work very well.

He notes that they are unreliable, don’t retain information, struggle to independently complete tasks as asked, “and can’t execute long-term plans without going off the rails.”

However, he’s hardly alone in working on fixes. Giant companies likeSalesforce and Microsoftare building agentic platforms.OpenAI is too. And agent startups abound: from task specialists (e.g., outbound sales, financial analysis) to those working on training data. Others are working onagent pricing economics.

In the meantime, Besiroglu wants you to know: Mechanize is hiring.

Read what Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook execs said about Instagram before buying it,https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/19/read-what-mark-zuckerberg-and-facebook-execs-said-about-instagram-before-buying-it/,TechCrunch,Sarah Perez,19-04-25,"The first week of theMeta antitrust trialbrought new revelations about how the company formerly known as Facebook approached the competitive threat posed by Instagram in the early 2010s.

The U.S. government is accusing Meta of violating competition laws by acquiring companies like Instagram and WhatsApp that threatened the Facebook monopoly. If lawyers for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are successful, the government could force Meta to break up its business by selling off Instagram and WhatsApp.

As part of the trial, the FTC shared compelling evidence to demonstrate that Facebook was very much aware of the risk Instagram created for its business as the photo-sharing app grew in popularity. In documents containing Facebook’s internal emails, Facebook execs fret over Instagram’s growth and discuss how much to pay for the app, if Facebook were to acquire it.

The company execs also discuss other strategies for limiting Instagram’s growth, including copying its functionality and releasing an app of their own, or buying the app and then no longer adding new features to it while working on its own products.

Facebook’s strategy to either buy or bury its competition is on display in these conversations, according to the government’s arguments. In addition to showing how the company was thinking about its competition at the time, the messages are indicative of the cutthroat strategies that have allowed Meta to become the social networking behemoth it is today.

Some of the highlights from these messages are below.

"OpenAI debuts Codex CLI, an open source coding tool for terminals",https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/openai-debuts-codex-cli-an-open-source-coding-tool-for-terminals/,TechCrunch,Kyle Wiggers,16-04-25,"In a bid to inject AI into more of the programming process, OpenAI is launchingCodex CLI, a coding “agent” designed to run locally from terminal software.

Announced on Wednesday alongside OpenAI’s newest AI models, o3 and o4-mini, Codex CLI links OpenAI’s models with local code and computing tasks, OpenAI says. Via Codex CLI, OpenAI’s models can write and edit code on a desktop and take certain actions, like moving files.

Codex CLI appears to be a small step in the direction of OpenAI’s broader agentic coding vision. Recently, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar,describedwhat she called the “agentic software engineer,” a set of tools OpenAI intends to build that can take a project description for an app and effectively create it and even quality assurance test it.

Codex CLI won’t go that far. But itwillintegrate OpenAI’s models, eventually including o3 and o4-mini, with the clients that process code and computer commands, otherwise known as command-line interfaces.

It’s also open source, OpenAI says.

“[Codex CLI is] a lightweight, open source coding agent that runs locally in your terminal,” an OpenAI spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “The goal [is to] give users a minimal, transparent interface to link models directly with [code and tasks].”

In a blog post provided to TechCrunch, OpenAI added, “You can get the benefits of multimodal reasoning from the command line by passing screenshots or low fidelity sketches to the model, combined with access to your code locally [via Codex CLI].”

To spur use of Codex CLI, OpenAI plans todole out $1 million in API grantsto eligible software development projects. The company says it’ll award $25,000 blocks of API credits to the projects chosen.

AI coding tools come with risks, of course.Manystudieshaveshownthat code-generating models frequently fail to fix security vulnerabilities and bugs, and even introduce them. It’s best to keep that in mind before giving AI access to sensitive files or projects — must less entire systems.
