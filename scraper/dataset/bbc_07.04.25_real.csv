Is the world heading into recession?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24q15d9yq0o,BBC,Simon Jack,7/4/2025,"US President Donald Trump's tariffs have ignited wildfires across global stock markets, but does that mean we are heading for a recession?

The first thing to stress is that what happens in the stock market is not the same as what happens in the economy - falling share prices do not always mean economic misery ahead.

But sometimes they do.

Very large falls in stock market values, like these, mean there has been a fundamental reappraisal of future profits for the companies that make up the stock markets of the world.

What markets quite reasonably expect is that increased tariffs will mean that costs will rise and profits will fall.

That doesn't mean that a recession is inevitable but the chances are clearly much higher than they were before Trump announced the most severe and wide-ranging tariffs seen in a century.

An economy is defined as being in recession when the total of everything we and the government spend or export shrinks for two successive three-month periods.

Between October and December last year, the UK economy grew a tiny 0.1% and the latest monthly data showed it shrank by the same amount in January.

The first estimate of how the UK economy fared in February will be released this coming Friday.

So, we are a long way off being able to tell whether we have hit that definition.

However, in the bloodbath of stock market falls, there are some particularly gory and worrying casualties.

Banks are often seen as proxies for economies. As one well respected market watcher told me today: ""The thing that made me catch my breath was the fall in the banks.""

HSBC and Standard Chartered - which operate at the intersection of international trade between east and west - were both down more than 10% overnight before recovering some ground.

Other warning signs are not on stock markets but commodity exchanges.

Copper and oil prices are considered barometers of global economic health.

Both have fallen more than 15% since Trump dropped his tariff bombshell.

There haven't been many truly global recessions.

The 1930s, the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis and the panic around the pandemic are three rare examples of when we saw synchronised downturns in major economies.

It is still considered unlikely that we would see something on that scale this time but the chances of recession in the US, UK and European Union have been significantly upgraded by most economic analysts.

On the plus side for UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the government's borrowing costs are likely to dip by around £5bn to £6bn a year as investors flock to the relative safety of government bonds.

But that will be more than offset by hits to government tax receipts if and when the economy as a whole goes into reverse.

Formula 1 legend Sir Jackie Stewart: 'My wife lives in a new world',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20g16r052o,BBC,Nikki Fox,7/4/2025,"Motor racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart has emotionally recounted the moment his wife forgot who he was, as his charity funds a new dementia blood test.

The three-time F1 champion said Lady Stewart inquired ""where's Jackie?"" while sitting with him.

He said the changes he had seen in his wife were the reason he had founded Race Against Dementia, which is funding a new blood test trial developed by the University of Cambridge.

The study hopes to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia decades before it develops.

Lady Stewart was diagnosed with the same type of dementia in 2014, and Sir Jackie said the behaviour and language changes he had witnessed were ""horrendous"".

""Just the other day it was time for dinner, she's getting up and I'm sitting close by, and she says, 'Where's Jackie?' That's the first time that's happened and that's only a few weeks ago,"" he said.

""A bad feeling came over me,"" he added, describing Lady Stewart's mind as being in ""a new world"".

Sir Jackie, who lives in Buckinghamshire but is from Scotland, described how his wife of more than 60 years had been diagnosed with dementia after she lost control of her small car and it landed on its roof.

No-one had been hurt, he said, but the incident had led to an ""awareness that something wasn't right"".

A decade later, Sir Jackie said the progression of the disease was such that Lady Stewart could no longer walk.

""I know that Helen doesn't mean it when she suddenly goes round and hits me, or the [specialist dementia] nurses,"" he said.

""She can hit somebody quite often, she uses language that she's never ever said in her life and it comes like that [clicks his fingers] and I say 'darling, darling, don't say that'.

""She says 'Why?' And she'll give me a row for doing that. That's usually after 17:00.""

'""Sundowning""is a common feature of dementia, where the brain tires and a person becomes more agitated later in the day.

Sir Jackie created an accessible home in Switzerland for Lady Stewart without steps or obstacles - and they employ nurses and specialist neurosurgeons.

He said he was aware of the privilege his F1 career had afforded him, and that for many families the only option was residential care.

""I visit homes for people with dementia and I leave in tears because people are completely lost,"" he said.

One in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, which Sir Jackie describes as a ""disaster"".

He said friends and a former secretary had also been diagnosed and understanding the brain was ""bigger than going to the moon"".

Research progress had been ""very slow"", with the medical profession ""failing so far"" and diseases like cancer being prioritised, he said.

His charity is now funding the development of a new blood test trial to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia 10 to 20 years before it is diagnosed.

Dr Maura Malpetti, senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said the ON-FIRE study was looking at the type of frontotemporal dementia that was not genetic - where diagnoses could not necessarily be predicted.

Dr Malpetti said people with frontotemporal dementia were often misdiagnosed.

""It is confused with psychiatric conditions because of the behavioural changes or the language problems,"" she said.

Her team is looking at how the presence of certain proteins in the blood could indicate the likelihood of future inflammation in the brain.

Changes in the blood could be present decades before the onset of physical symptoms and they were usually only picked up by scans, which took longer to carry out and required specialist equipment.

A major problem facing trials for new dementia drugs is that they often involve patients who have already received a diagnosis.

It means they are already showing symptoms - but by this time, it may be too late for the drugs to make a difference.

Identifying individuals decades before they show symptoms allows researchers to trial drugs to see if they reduce the risk of dementia.

Three hundred patients were being recruited at 20 centres across England and Dr Malpetti said the trial would eventually be rolled out to 1,000 participants.

The study is one of a number of dementia blood tests being developed in the UK, including one at theUniversity of Oxford.

Dr Malpetti said they hoped to see ""tremendous"" developments in the next five years because of the number of inflammation studies.

""I think there's been a revelation in the field of blood tests because this allows us to use more accessible and scalable tests,"" she said.

Dr Malpetti said they would freeze the samples so that if a new inflammation marker was discovered, they could go back and test that in the blood.

She added an earlier diagnosis would empower families, allowing them to contribute to research to find a cure.

""The earlier we understand the changes in the brain, maybe we can stop or slow down the symptoms while the person is still well,"" she said.

Sir Jackie said Formula One brought funding and business acumen to health research.

The most recent fundraiser was theOne Lap Challengeahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.

""When you have a problem in Formula One [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they're also changing it [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm, and they see the results,"" he said.

Dr Malpetti said she hoped charities like Race against Dementia could transform research, helping it to progress faster.

Sir Jackie said he hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime.

""I want this to happen just as much as I wanted to be world champion,"" he said. ""It's terribly important.""

Dozens die after torrential rain hammers Congolese capital,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr782rgn8x4o,BBC,"Natasha Booty, Emery Makumeno",7/4/2025,"Torrential rains and floods have killed at least 33 people in Kinshasa - the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo - according to officials.

""The republic will not abandon you,"" President Félix Tshisekedi promised victims on Monday, saying he had called a government crisis meeting.

Desperate residents are trying to flee the floodwaters by wading, swimming or paddling to safety in homemade canoes.

The city ishome to 17 million peopleand sits on the Congo river, which is one of the biggest in the world and stretches across the country.

Flooding is common - the river recently reached its highest level in six decades.

Parts of the capital are prone to soil erosion and in recent years the Congolese president haswarned that the climate crisis is making flooding worse.

Many homes in west Kinshasa were swept away following flooding overnight from Friday into Saturday.

About half of the city's 26 districts are affected in total, according to the capital's mayor, who says search and rescue teams have been sent out.

Worst affected are the city's outskirts as well as some of its poorest neighbourhoods.

""The water has reached 1.5 metres high. We have just managed to save ourselves, the rest is trapped in our homes,"" Christophe Bola who lives in the Ndanu area told the AFP news agency.

Other local residents have told reporters they are angry with the authorities, accusing them of being too slow to react and not sending enough help.



The floods have also left people across much of Kinshasa struggling with water shortages, after water treatment pumps in the city were themselves inundated.

The city's busiest road, which connects the centre with the international airport, is impassable, as is some of the motorway that connects the capital to the country's main port, Matadi.

At least one tributary leading off the Congo river - the N'djili river - has burst its banks, trapping many residents there, said Deputy President Jacquemain Shabani in a statement on Sunday.

It is said to be one of the more polluted riverswhich Congolese scientists say contains high levels of fecal matterand other waste.

Sewage maintenance is poor in many areas of Kinshasa, and there is little evidence of town planning.

Last year the government announced plans to tackle this long-standing problem.

Further heavy downpours are expected in Kinshasa in the coming weeks, as well as in the eastern city of Goma which was seized by rebel forces earlier this year.

The national meteorological agency also warns of heavy rains elsewhere, especially in the north and north-east of the country.

Meghan's divisiveness may well work to her advantage,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz79wq00425o,BBC,Daniela Relph,6/4/2025,"Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?

Listen to Daniela read this article

""The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam."" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.

As an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.

When I first spoke to her about this - long before ""Megxit"" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. ""Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?"" she told me.

Seven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. ""As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.""

Only not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)

Her recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either.

Despite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).

This was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, £11 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of £21.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters — with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.

Now, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: ""I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities."" But the question now is how will this be received.

And, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative?

Or could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?

It has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.

As the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.

The printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.

It was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.

Someone who attended the service that day described it to me as ""deeply uncomfortable"".

The friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.

According to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: ""Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.""

Mark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through ""the royal lens"". ""Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?""

There have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.

One source who has worked with them described this as ""brave and idiotic"".

With that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: ""She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.""

Much of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, ""is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family"", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. ""That connection shapes how everything she does is received.""

Early indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.

Some critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an ""unerring instinct for getting it wrong"".

On the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: ""Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.""

Other criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.

""High on gloss, low on human connection,"" said British Vogue. ""Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,"" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an ""exercise in narcissism"".

Royal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. ""What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,"" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran.

""It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?""

And yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.

And there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. ""Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,"" points out Mr Crawford.

""Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.""

With Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair.

""I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,"" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. ""A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.""

What's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to.

Existing Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing.

""In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,"" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.

The wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: ""You guys I'm scared for Meghan,"" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note.

""Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,"" the note reads. ""Don't be. This is the fun part — let's enjoy it.""

Likewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.

In an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: ""I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever."" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: ""Do you understand this?"" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.

It was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.

Away from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.

Meghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.

When the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. ""Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,"" says Mr Vij.

""They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,"" he adds. ""They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.""

Yet for every positive story comes a negative one – with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.

""The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,"" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.

More recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission.

Insiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.

But though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.

The question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. ""They keep trying new things,"" argues Ms Peele. ""Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.""

Mr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.

""They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,"" he says. ""But you can only ride that train for so long… She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.""

However their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. ""Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?""

With a pause she adds: ""He's now a spare to his wife.""

And yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. ""It's never too late to turn things around,"" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals.

""But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.""

What that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)

""She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,"" argues Ms Peele. ""She has evolved."" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.

But Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals.

""While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.

""That's where they really have impact and stand out.""

"Chemical burns, assaults, electric shocks - Gazans tell BBC of torture in Israeli detention",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7vje365rno,BBC,Alice Cuddy,7/4/2025,"Warning: This article contains distressing content

Palestinian detainees released back to Gaza have told the BBC they were subjected to mistreatment and torture at the hands of Israeli military and prison staff, adding to reports of misconduct within Israel's barracks and jails.

One man said he was attacked with chemicals and set alight. ""I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out [on my body],"" said Mohammad Abu Tawileh, a 36-year-old mechanic.

We have conducted in-depth interviews with five released detainees, all of whom were arrested in Gaza in the months after Hamas and other groups killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage. The men were held underIsrael's Unlawful Combatants Law, a measure by which people suspected of posing a security risk can be detained for an unspecified period without charge, as Israel set out to recover the hostages and dismantle the proscribed terror group.

The men say they were accused of having links with Hamas and questioned over the location of hostages and tunnels, but were not found to be involved in the 7 October 2023 attacks -a condition Israel had set for anyone released under the recent ceasefire deal.

Some of those freed under the deal were serving sentences for other serious crimes, including the killing of Israelis, but that was not the case for our interviewees. We also asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Prison Service (IPS) if there were any convictions or accusations against the men but they did not respond to that question.

In the men's testimony:

We have seen reports by a lawyer who visited two of the men in prison, and have spoken to medical staff who treated some of them on their return.

The BBC sent a lengthy right of reply letter to the IDF which laid out in detail the men's allegations and their identities.

In its statement, the IDF did not respond to any of the specific allegations, but said it ""completely rejects accusations of systematic abuse of detainees"".

It said some of the cases raised by the BBC would be ""examined by the relevant authorities"". It added that others ""were brought without sufficient detail, without any detail regarding the identity of the detainees, making them impossible to examine"".

It continued: ""The IDF takes any… actions which contradict its values very seriously… Specific complaints about inappropriate behaviour by detention facility staff or insufficient conditions are forwarded for examination by the relevant authorities and are dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, disciplinary actions are taken against the staff members of the facility, and criminal investigations are opened.""

The IPS said it was not aware of any of the claims of abuse described in our investigation, in its prisons. ""[A]s far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,"" it added.

Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said the treatment the men described was ""entirely inconsistent with both international law and Israeli law"", and in some cases would ""meet the threshold of torture"".

""Under international law, the law of armed conflict requires you to treat all detainees humanely,"" he said. ""The obligations relating to the basic needs of detainees are unaffected by any alleged wrongdoing.""

The five Palestinians interviewed in depth were returned earlier this year under the ceasefire deal with Hamas - the group that led the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.

They were among about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees exchanged for 33 Israeli hostages, eight dead and 25 living, some of whom havedescribed being abused, starved and threatenedby their Hamas captors.

Female hostages previously released havedetailed physical and sexual assaults in captivity.

Israel says forensic tests showsome of the dead hostages returned in the ceasefire, including children, were killed by Hamas,though the group denies this.

The five released Palestinian detainees all described the same pattern - being arrested in Gaza, taken into Israel to be detained first in military barracks before being moved on to prison, and finally released back to Gaza months later.

They said they had been abused at every stage of the process.

More than a dozen other released detainees, whom the BBC spoke to more briefly as they arrived home in Gaza, also gave accounts of beatings, hunger and disease.

These, in turn, align with testimony given by othersto Israeli human rights group B'Tselemand the United Nations, which in July detailed reports from returning detainees that they had been stripped naked, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burned with cigarettes, and had dogs set on them.

A further reportby UN experts last monthdocumented cases of rape and sexual assault, and said using this as a threat was ""standard operating procedure"" for the IDF. Israel responded to say it ""categorically rejects the unfounded allegations"".

As Israel does not currently allow international journalists free access to Gaza, our interviews were conducted by phone call and text message, and also in person by our contracted freelancers in the territory.

All five men told us their abuse had begun at the moment of their arrest - when they said they had been stripped, blindfolded and beaten.

Mechanic Mohammad Abu Tawileh told us he had been tortured for days.

He was taken by soldiers to a building not far from the location of his arrest in March 2024, he said, and held in a room - the sole detainee there - for three days of interrogation by troops.

Warning: Graphic image below

Soldiers mixed chemicals used for cleaning into a pot, he told us, and dunked his head in them. The interrogators then punched him, he said, and he fell to the rubble-strewn floor, injuring his eye. He said they then covered his eye with a cloth, which he said ""worsened his injury"".

They also set him alight, he told us.

""They used an air freshener with a lighter to set my back on fire. I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out. It spread from my neck down to my legs. Then, they repeatedly hit me with the bottoms of their rifles, and had sticks with them, which they used to hit and poke me on my sides,"" he said.

They then ""continued pouring acid on me. I spent around a day and a half being washed with [it],"" he told us.

""They poured it on my head, and it dripped down my body while I was sitting on the chair.""

Eventually, he said, soldiers poured water on his body, and drove him into Israel where he received medical treatment in hospital, including skin grafts.

Most of his treatment, he said, took place at a field hospital at Sde Teiman barracks, an IDF base near Beersheba in southern Israel. He said he was cuffed naked to a bed and given a nappy instead of access to a toilet. Israeli doctors at this hospital have previously told the BBCshackling patients and forcing them to wear nappies is routine.

When the BBC interviewed Mr Abu Tawileh shortly after his release, his back was covered in red welts. The residual pain from his burns still woke him up, he said, and his vision had been affected.

The BBC was not able to speak to anyone who witnessed an attack on Mr Abu Tawileh, but a specialist eye doctor who treated him on his return to Gaza confirmed that he had suffered a chemical burn to the eye, damaging the skin around it. He also said Mr Abu Tawileh's vision was weakening, due to either the chemicals or other trauma.

We showed images of his injuries and gave details of his testimony to several UK doctors, who said they appeared consistent with his account, though they noted there were limitations to what they could assess by looking at photos.

The BBC gave extensive details of this account to the IDF, giving it five days to investigate. It did not respond directly to Mr Abu Tawileh's allegations but said it took any actions ""which contradict its values very seriously"".

It said it would ""examine"" some of the cases, but did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this included Mr Abu Tawileh.

Others we interviewed also described abuse at the point of arrest.

""They cuffed us and hit us. No-one would give me a drop of water,"" said Abdul Karim Mushtaha, a 33-year-old poultry slaughterhouse worker, who told us he was arrested in November 2023 at an Israeli checkpoint while following evacuation orders with his family. A report filed by a lawyer who later visited Mr Mushtaha noted he had been ""subjected to severe beatings, humiliation, degradation and stripping during his arrest until he was transferred to prison"".

Two said they had then been left outside in the cold for hours, and two said Israeli soldiers stole their belongings and money.

The BBC gave details of the allegations of theft to the IDF, which described it as ""contrary to the law and IDF values"". It said it would ""thoroughly"" examine the cases if more details were provided.

All our interviewees, including Mr Mushtaha, said they were transferred to the Israeli barracks of Sde Teiman, where Mr Abu Tawileh also said he received treatment in its field hospital.

One interviewee told us he was mistreated on the way there. He asked for his name not to be published for fear of reprisals, so we are calling him ""Omar"".

He said Israeli soldiers stood and spat on him, and others with him, calling them ""sons of pigs"" and ""sons of Sinwar"" - referring to the Hamas leader and architect of the 7 October attacks, killed by Israel five months ago.

""They made us listen to a voice recording that said: 'What you did to our children, we will do to your children',"" said the 33-year-old, who worked for an electrical cable company.

Sde Teiman has been the focus of previous serious complaints in the wake of the October 2023 attacks. Several soldiers stationed there were charged in February after they were filmed assaulting a detainee, resulting in his hospitalisation for a torn rectum and a punctured lung. In a separate case, a soldier at the base was sentenced after headmitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza.

Three of the men we spoke to alleged that dogs were used to intimidate detainees at Sde Teiman and other facilities.

""We would get beaten up when they took us from the barracks to the medical clinic or the interrogation room - they'd set [muzzled] dogs on us, tighten our cuffs,"" said Mr Abu Tawileh who was held in general detention in the barracks, as well as being treated there.

The BBC asked the IDF to respond to allegations it frequently used dogs to intimidate and attack detainees. It said: ""The use of dogs to harm detainees is prohibited.""

It also said there were ""experienced terrorists considered to be very dangerous among the detainees held in IDF detention facilities"" and that ""in exceptional cases there is extended shackling during their detention"".

Several detainees said they had been forced to assume stress positions, including having their arms lifted above their heads for hours.

""We would be sitting on our knees from 5am until 10pm, when it was time to sleep,"" said Mr Abu Tawileh.

Hamad al-Dahdouh, another interviewee, said beatings at the barracks ""targeted our heads and sensitive areas like the eyes [and] ears"".

The 44-year-old, who worked as a farmer before the war, said he had suffered temporary back and ear damage as a result, and his rib cage had been fractured.

The IDF did not respond to this allegation.

Mr Dahdouh and some of the other released detainees said electric shocks were also used during interrogations or as punishment.

""The oppression units would bring dogs, sticks and stun guns, they would electrocute and beat us,"" he said.

They would be subjected to beatings and intimidation every time they were moved, Mr Abu Tawileh added.

During these interrogations they had been accused of links with Hamas, the men added.

""Anyone who was imprisoned… they said: 'You are a terrorist',"" said Mr Mushtaha. ""They always tried to tell us that we had taken part in 7 October. They all had a grudge.

""I told them: 'If I am Hamas or anyone else, would I be moving through the safe passage? Would I have listened to your calls to leave?'""

He said interrogations would go through the night.

""For three nights, I couldn't sleep because they were torturing me. Our hands were tied and put above our heads for hours, and we weren't wearing anything. Any time you would say 'I'm cold'… they would fill a bucket with cold water, pour it on you and switch on the fan.""

Mr Dahdouh said their interrogators told them that whoever is from Gaza ""is affiliated with terrorist groups"", and when detainees asked if they could challenge this in court they were told there was no time for that.

He said he was not given access to a lawyer. The IDF told the BBC: ""Israeli law grants the right to judicial review in a civil district court, legal representation by an attorney, and the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.""

""Omar"" said he was taken for three days of interrogation when he first arrived at Sde Teiman.

He said the detainees were dressed in thin overalls and held in a freezing room, with loud speakers playing Israeli music.

When the questioning was over, the men said they were led back to the barracks blindfolded.

""We didn't know if night had come or morning had come. You don't see the sun. You don't see anything,"" said Omar.

The IDF said it had ""oversight mechanisms"", including closed-circuit cameras, ""to ensure that detention facilities are managed in accordance with IDF orders and the law"".

Omar and Mr Mushtaha said they were then transferred to Ketziot prison, where they described a ""welcoming ceremony"" of beatings and other abuse.

Omar said he witnessed sexual assault at Ketziot.

""They took the clothes off some of the guys and would do shameful acts… They forced guys to perform sex acts on each other. I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't penetrative sex. He would tell one guy to suck another guy. It was obligatory.""

The BBC did not receive any other reports of this nature, but the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which tracks conditions of Palestinians in Israeli jails, described sexual abuse of detainees held in Ketziot as a ""common occurrence"". This ranged from rape and sexual harassment to the beatings of genitals, it said.

The group said that while it had not received testimony of forced sexual acts between detainees, it had been told some had been made to look at each other naked and had been thrown on top of each other naked.

A report by B'Tselem has also gathered allegations of sexual violence, including from one prisoner who said guards attempted to rape him with a carrot.

The BBC put the allegation that prisoners were forced to perform sexual acts on each other to the Israel Prison Service (IPS). It replied that it was ""not aware"" of the sexual abuse claim or any of the other claims made about treatment and conditions at Ketziot and other prisons that the BBC had gathered.

It said: ""IPS is a law enforcement organisation that operates according to the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the state comptroller and many other official critiques.

""All prisoners are detained according to the law. All basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards. We are not aware of the claims you described and, as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.

""Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.""

Omar said they were also hit with batons at Ketziot prison.

""After we got tortured, I was in pain all night - from my back to my legs. The guys would carry me from my mattress to the toilet. My body, my back, my legs - my whole body was blue from beatings. For nearly two months I couldn't move.""

Mr Mushtaha described having his head slammed into a door, and his genitals hit.

""They would strip us naked. They would Taser us. They would hit us in a sensitive place. They would tell us 'We will castrate you',"" he said.

He said beatings were ""meant to break your bones"", and that detainees would sometimes be grouped together and have hot water poured over them.

""The amount of torture was enormous,"" he added.

Both he and Omar also described incidents of what they said amounted to medical negligence.

""My hands were all blisters and swollen,"" said Mr Mushtaha.

""If people could have seen my legs they would have said they needed to be amputated from the inflammation… [Guards] would just tell me to wash my hands and legs with water and soap.

""But how was I meant to do this, when there was only water for one hour a day [between us], and as for soap, every week they would bring [only] a spoon of shampoo,"" he added.

Mr Mushtaha said he was told by guards that: ""As long as you have a pulse you are in good shape. As long as you are standing, you're in good shape. When your pulse is gone, we will come to treat you.""

A report by a lawyer who visited both Mr Mushtaha and Omar in Ketziot last September said of Mr Mushtaha: ""The prisoner, like the rest of the prisoners, suffers from pain due to boils on his hands, feet and buttocks, and there is no cleanliness and he is not provided with any kind of treatment.""

Mr Mushtaha also provided the BBC with a report compiled by a doctor in Gaza, which confirmed he was still infected with scabies on the day of his release.

Omar said detainees were beaten for requesting medical care.

The lawyer noted that Omar needed attention for ""pimples spreading on the skin - in the groin and buttocks due to the harsh prison conditions"" including lack of toiletries and polluted water. ""The prisoner says that even when it is his turn to shower he tries to avoid it because the water… causes itching and inflammation.""

All the detainees added they had been given limited access to food and water while in detention at various facilities - several reported losing significant amounts of weight.

Omar said he lost 30kg (4st 10lb). The lawyer said Omar told him food was ""almost non-existent"" in the first few months, though conditions later ""improved a little"".

Mr Mushtaha described food there being left outside their caged compounds for cats and birds to eat from first.

Another of our interviewees, Ahmed Abu Seif, said he was taken to a different prison - Megiddo, near the occupied West Bank, after being arrested on his 17th birthday.

He said Israeli authorities would regularly storm their cells there and spray them with tear gas.

""We would feel suffocated and unable to breathe well for four days after each tear gas attack,"" according to Ahmed, who said he had been held in the prison's youth wing.

""There was no consideration of us being children, they treated us like the militants of 7 October.""

During interrogations he had his nails pulled out, he told us. When the BBC filmed him the day after his release, he showed us how several of his toenails were still affected, as well as scars on his hands he said had been caused by handcuffs and dog scratches.

The IPS did not respond to this allegation.

Two of the men said they had witnessed the deaths of fellow detainees in Sde Teiman and Ketziot - one through beatings, including the use of dogs, and one through medical negligence.

The names and dates they gave of the incidents match media reports and accounts from human rights groups.

At least 63 Palestinian prisoners - 40 of them from Gaza - have died in Israeli custody since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian Prisoners Society told the BBC.

The IPS did not respond to questions about deaths of Palestinians in custody, while the IDF said it was ""aware of cases of detainee deaths, including those who were detained with pre-existing illness or injury resulting from combat"".

""According to procedures, an investigation is opened by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) into every detainee death,"" it added.

The abuse continued right up to the moment they were freed in February, some of the men said.

""On the release day, they treated us brutally. They tightened the handcuffs and when they wanted to make us move they put our hands above our heads and pulled us,"" Mr Mushtaha said.

""They said: 'If you interact with Hamas or work with Hamas, you will be targeted.' They said: 'We will send a missile directly to you.'""

Ahmed, 17, also said conditions worsened after the ceasefire deal was signed in January. ""The soldiers intensified the aggression against us knowing we were getting released soon.""

It was only once the detainees were transferred to the Red Cross bus for transportation back to Gaza that they felt ""safe"", Omar said.

Footage showed some being returned in sweatshirts with the Star of David on them and the words: ""We do not forget and we do not forgive"" written in Arabic.

An official at Gaza's European Hospital, which assessed the conditions of returned detainees, said skin conditions, including scabies, were common, and medics had observed many cases of ""extreme emaciation and malnutrition"" and ""the physical effects of torture"".

Legal expert Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne told us: ""Certainly the use of chemicals to burn the detainee and submerge their head would meet the threshold of torture, as would the use of electric shocks, removal of toenails, and severe beatings. These, or comparable acts, have all been recognised to constitute torture by international bodies,"" as have the use of stress positions and loud music.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which conducts interviews with returning detainees, said it could not comment on individuals' conditions due to privacy concerns.

It added that it was eager to be granted access to those still detained - something which has not been allowed since the 7 October attacks.

""The ICRC remains deeply concerned about the wellbeing of detainees and emphasises the urgent need for it to resume visits to all places of detention. We continue to request access in bilateral and confidential dialogue with the parties,"" it told the BBC.

Fifty-nine hostages are still being held in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. The ICRC has never been granted access to them in their 18 months in captivity, and their loved ones have grave concerns over their wellbeing.

For many of the released Palestinian detainees, returning to Gaza was both a moment of celebration and of despair.

Mr Abu Tawileh said his family was shocked by his appearance when he was released, and added he was still affected by his experience.

""I am unable to do anything because of my injury, because my eye hurts, and it tears and feels itchy, and all of the burns on my body feels itchy as well. This is bothering me a lot,"" he said.

Teenager Ahmed said he now wants to leave Gaza.

""I want to emigrate because of the things we saw in detention, and because of the mental torture of fearing the bombs falling on our heads. We wished for death but couldn't find it.""

Trump asks US Supreme Court to block order to return deported man,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5xvjj9j1o,BBC,Kayla Epstein,7/4/2025,"President Donald Trump's administration has asked the Supreme Court to block lower court rulings requiring that a man deported to El Salvador be returned to the US.

A federal judge in Marylandordered the governmentto bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back by Monday night. The order was upheld by an appeals court on Monday.

The government has said Mr Garcia was deported on 15 March due to an ""administrative error"", although they also maintain he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.

In their emergency appeal to America's highest court, the administration argued the Maryland judge lacked authority to issue the order and that US officials cannot compel El Salvador to return Mr Garcia.

US Solicitor General D John Sauer wrote in his court filing: ""The United States does not control the sovereign nation of El Salvador, nor can it compel El Salvador to follow a federal judge's bidding.""

He added: ""The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal.""

Mr Garcia had been in the US illegally, although a judge granted him protection from deportation in 2019.

"Apple's encryption row with UK should not be secret, court rules",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn1lz3v4no,BBC,"Tom Singleton, Liv McMahon",7/4/2025,"A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.

The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.

At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a ""backdoor"" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.

The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.

In February,Apple pulled ADP from the UKand in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.

The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the ""bare details of the case"".

In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.

""It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,"" it states.

""For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,"" it later adds.

In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its ""first priority is to keep people safe.""

""There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,"" it added.

It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.

Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.

They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.

""This is bigger than the UK and Apple,"" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.

""The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.""

The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.

Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is ""effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case"".

""The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,"" she adds.

Apple declined to comment.

In a previous statement it told the BBC:  ""Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.

""As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.""

ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.

It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the ""key"" necessary to unscramble and access the data.

E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.

It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.

They can request to view information stored with lower levels of protection - but companies such as Apple have no way of allowing them to view files secured with E2EE because they do not possess such a capability.

Campaign group Privacy International said the right of individuals also needed to be protected - and welcomed today's ruling.

""Executive decisions affecting the privacy and security of billions of people globally should be open to legal challenge in the most transparent way possible"", it said.

Formula 1 legend Sir Jackie Stewart: 'My wife lives in a new world',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20g16r052o,BBC,Nikki Fox,7/4/2025,"Motor racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart has emotionally recounted the moment his wife forgot who he was, as his charity funds a new dementia blood test.

The three-time F1 champion said Lady Stewart inquired ""where's Jackie?"" while sitting with him.

He said the changes he had seen in his wife were the reason he had founded Race Against Dementia, which is funding a new blood test trial developed by the University of Cambridge.

The study hopes to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia decades before it develops.

Lady Stewart was diagnosed with the same type of dementia in 2014, and Sir Jackie said the behaviour and language changes he had witnessed were ""horrendous"".

""Just the other day it was time for dinner, she's getting up and I'm sitting close by, and she says, 'Where's Jackie?' That's the first time that's happened and that's only a few weeks ago,"" he said.

""A bad feeling came over me,"" he added, describing Lady Stewart's mind as being in ""a new world"".

Sir Jackie, who lives in Buckinghamshire but is from Scotland, described how his wife of more than 60 years had been diagnosed with dementia after she lost control of her small car and it landed on its roof.

No-one had been hurt, he said, but the incident had led to an ""awareness that something wasn't right"".

A decade later, Sir Jackie said the progression of the disease was such that Lady Stewart could no longer walk.

""I know that Helen doesn't mean it when she suddenly goes round and hits me, or the [specialist dementia] nurses,"" he said.

""She can hit somebody quite often, she uses language that she's never ever said in her life and it comes like that [clicks his fingers] and I say 'darling, darling, don't say that'.

""She says 'Why?' And she'll give me a row for doing that. That's usually after 17:00.""

'""Sundowning""is a common feature of dementia, where the brain tires and a person becomes more agitated later in the day.

Sir Jackie created an accessible home in Switzerland for Lady Stewart without steps or obstacles - and they employ nurses and specialist neurosurgeons.

He said he was aware of the privilege his F1 career had afforded him, and that for many families the only option was residential care.

""I visit homes for people with dementia and I leave in tears because people are completely lost,"" he said.

One in three people will develop dementia in their lifetime, which Sir Jackie describes as a ""disaster"".

He said friends and a former secretary had also been diagnosed and understanding the brain was ""bigger than going to the moon"".

Research progress had been ""very slow"", with the medical profession ""failing so far"" and diseases like cancer being prioritised, he said.

His charity is now funding the development of a new blood test trial to detect signs of frontotemporal dementia 10 to 20 years before it is diagnosed.

Dr Maura Malpetti, senior research fellow at the University of Cambridge, said the ON-FIRE study was looking at the type of frontotemporal dementia that was not genetic - where diagnoses could not necessarily be predicted.

Dr Malpetti said people with frontotemporal dementia were often misdiagnosed.

""It is confused with psychiatric conditions because of the behavioural changes or the language problems,"" she said.

Her team is looking at how the presence of certain proteins in the blood could indicate the likelihood of future inflammation in the brain.

Changes in the blood could be present decades before the onset of physical symptoms and they were usually only picked up by scans, which took longer to carry out and required specialist equipment.

A major problem facing trials for new dementia drugs is that they often involve patients who have already received a diagnosis.

It means they are already showing symptoms - but by this time, it may be too late for the drugs to make a difference.

Identifying individuals decades before they show symptoms allows researchers to trial drugs to see if they reduce the risk of dementia.

Three hundred patients were being recruited at 20 centres across England and Dr Malpetti said the trial would eventually be rolled out to 1,000 participants.

The study is one of a number of dementia blood tests being developed in the UK, including one at theUniversity of Oxford.

Dr Malpetti said they hoped to see ""tremendous"" developments in the next five years because of the number of inflammation studies.

""I think there's been a revelation in the field of blood tests because this allows us to use more accessible and scalable tests,"" she said.

Dr Malpetti said they would freeze the samples so that if a new inflammation marker was discovered, they could go back and test that in the blood.

She added an earlier diagnosis would empower families, allowing them to contribute to research to find a cure.

""The earlier we understand the changes in the brain, maybe we can stop or slow down the symptoms while the person is still well,"" she said.

Sir Jackie said Formula One brought funding and business acumen to health research.

The most recent fundraiser was theOne Lap Challengeahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix.

""When you have a problem in Formula One [clicks his fingers] it's fixed... they're also changing it [technology] all the time, because they have enthusiasm, and they see the results,"" he said.

Dr Malpetti said she hoped charities like Race against Dementia could transform research, helping it to progress faster.

Sir Jackie said he hoped a cure could be found in his lifetime.

""I want this to happen just as much as I wanted to be world champion,"" he said. ""It's terribly important.""

King and Queen arrive in Italy for state visit,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70ze48nel8o,BBC,Sean Coughlan,7/4/2025,"King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived in Rome to begin their state visit to Italy, which will see a mix of soft-power diplomacy, greeting the crowds and also romance, as the trip coincides with the couple's 20th wedding anniversary.

They flew into Ciampino airport, stepping out into late afternoon sunshine, with Italian government officials and a guard of honour to greet them.

The UK's ambassador to Italy, Lord Llewellyn, part of the welcoming party, said this was an ""historic"" moment and such visits had an ""intangible but priceless"" impact.

Against a backdrop of international uncertainty, the visit is part of the UK's post-Brexit ""reset"" in reinforcing links with European allies.

""This state visit comes at a key moment,"" said Lord Llewellyn, ""as we reset our relations with our European partners"".

There had already been reports of ""royal fever"" and the Italian public valued the King and Queen's enthusiasm for their history, culture and cooking, said Lord Llewellyn, speaking to reporters ahead of the visit.

""Their love for Italy... and all things Italian resonate deeply here,"" said the ambassador, predicting a warm welcome ahead of the trip to Rome and the historic city of Ravenna.

The state visit was originally intended to include the Vatican, where the King had been due to attend events including a service in the Sistine Chapel, but that had beenpostponed because of the ill-health of Pope Francis.

The Pope seems to be recovering,appearing in St Peter's Squareat the weekend, but so far there are no plans for a private meeting, although there has been speculation it might be something that would appeal to both sides if possible.

State visits, carried out on behalf of the UK government, are an eclectic mix of elaborate ceremony, charming the crowds, flying the flag for business, trying local food and addressing serious international diplomacy.

It will be pizza, pasta and policy.

The visit comes at a time of economic and diplomatic upheaval from US President Donald Trump - and accompanying the King is the UK's Foreign Secretary David Lammy.

There will be an emphasis on the UK's closer military ties with Italy, which Lord Llewellyn said was ""vital in a changing Europe, as both our countries stand steadfast in our support for Ukraine"".

Italy is also the UK's ninth biggest trading partner - and a popular tourist destination, with Rome's historic sights currently overflowing with holidaymakers.

There was a nod to Canada too in the ambassador's comments, saying that a trip to Ravenna would reflect that King Charles was also King of Canada, with tributes to be paid to Canadian forces who helped to liberate Italy 80 years ago during the Second World War.

The King has had a complicated diplomatic balancing act, as head of state of both the UK and Canada, at a time whenCanada has been put under great pressureby the Trump administration.

Scottishwhisky producers, worrying about US tariffs, might also welcome a plug for their produce at a food festival in Ravenna, where it will be paired with parmesan cheese.

Over the next three days, the royal couple will visit the Colosseum, watch a joint Italian and UK airforce flypast and learn about Italian slow food. The King will also meet Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni and become the first UK monarch to give a speech to both houses of Italy's parliament.

The culture-loving royals will also have visits associated with the writers Dante and Lord Byron.

The evening of the King and Queen's wedding anniversary on Wednesday will be spent at the Quirinale Palace for a state banquet. It will be a big personal moment for the couple, but these are also glitzy public events, with celebrities and politicians on the guest list, with a menu that showcases the country's cuisine.

Ahead of the trip, there was anItalian dinner at the King's Highgrove estatein Gloucestershire, attended by guests including film stars Stanley Tucci and Helen Mirren, and former footballer David Beckham.

The state visit is going to be an intensive set of engagements and follows a recent ""bump in the road"" for the King's health.

He had a brief stay in hospital aftersuffering side effects from his cancer treatment, but was well enough to return to a series of engagements last week.

Ambassador Lord Llewellyn said he was confident the trip by the royals - described as ""Carlo and Camilla"" in the Italian press - would leave a ""meaningful and broad legacy"".

Elon Musk's X to clamp down on parody accounts,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g37elkrxdo,BBC,Liv McMahon,7/4/2025,"X is bringing in stricter rules around parody accounts.

From 10 April, accounts which impersonate another user or person must use key words such as ""fake"" or ""parody"" at the start of their account names.

The platform will also require parody account holders to use different images to the X accounts belonging to those they seek to represent.

Some users have complained about confusion caused by parody accounts on the platform, such as those impersonating its owner Elon Musk.

""These changes are designed to help users better understand the unaffiliated nature of PCF accounts and reduce the risk of confusion or impersonation,"" the companysaid in a post on Saturday.

It encouraged affected accounts to update their profiles by the enforcement date.

The changes will also apply for fan and commentary accounts, it said.

""Hopefully this includes all the thousands of fake variations of Elon Musk accounts,""  wrote one user in response to X's post about its policy update.

""About time, I get a fake Elon account contacting me almost once a week,"" wrote another.

There are a number of parody accounts for the platform's owner, identifying themselves as impersonations in various ways.

Posts viewed by the BBC from Elon Musk parody accounts ranged from memes and jokes, to promoting cryptocurrency and car giveaways.

A recent post by one Elon Musk parody account, which has more than one million followers, told users to ""like and comment"" for the chance to win a Tesla.

The post has received 428,000 likes and more than 200,000 replies.

X rolled out labels for parody accounts in January - building onits rules requiringusers engaging in impersonation for the purpose of entertainment to identify themselves as such.

These, and the platform's blue tick verification system, have been cited as tools to prevent misleading impersonation while allowing speech and discussion.

But the effectiveness of such measures have been disputed.

The EU said in July 2024 that the blue ticks breached its online content rules, with its ""verified"" blue tick accountshaving the potential to ""deceive"" users.

Musk called the EU's rules ""misinformation"", in response.

Following his takeover in November 2022, the Tesla chief executive saidaccounts engaging in unlabelled impersonation would be banned.

Many parody accounts on X identify their parody nature in brackets at the end of user names, but this is not a fool-proof measure.

If a parody account's name is particularly long, and only a shortened version appears in feeds or replies, users can unwittingly duped - especially if the account's image matches that of the real person.

Omar Mohammed Saada Rabea, 14, was shot on the outskirts of Turmus Ayya on Sunday evening along with two other 14-year-old boys, one of whom was seriously wounded. The other suffered minor wounds.

The Israeli military said its troops opened fire at three ""terrorists"" who were throwing stones towards a highway and endangering civilians driving on it.

The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called the latest in a ""series of extrajudicial killings"" by Israeli forces.

There was no immediate comment from the US, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due to meet President Donald Trump on Monday to discuss the war in the Gaza Strip, Iran and US tariffs.

There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza.

Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their search-and-arrest raids across the territory, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel.

The mayor of Turmus Ayya said Omar Rabea was shot dead on Sunday near the entrance to the town, which is about 15km (9 miles) north-east of Ramallah and has a sizeable population of Palestinian-Americans.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said one of the two boys was shot in the lower abdomen and the other in the thigh.

AFP news agency cited one of the boys, whom it identified as Abdul Rahman Shehadeh, as saying he was shot by a soldier while collecting fruit.

The father of the third boy, Ayoub Asaad, said he was also a US citizen and that the ambulance transporting him to hospital was stopped by Israeli soldiers at a military checkpoint outside the town, according to AFP.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that during counter-terrorism activity in the Turmus Ayya area its soldiers ""identified three terrorists who hurled rocks toward the highway, thus endangering civilians driving"".

The soldiers fired towards them, ""eliminating one terrorist and hitting two additional terrorists"", it added.

The foreign ministry of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority denounced the ""use of live fire against three children"" by Israeli forces.

""Israel's continued impunity as an illegal occupying power encourages it to commit further crimes,"" it warned.

Last Thursday, the UN human rights chief said the situation in the West Bank was ""extremely alarming"".

Volker Türk told the UN Security Council that Israeli operations in the north had killed hundreds of people, destroyed entire refugee camps and makeshift medical sites, and displaced more than 40,000 Palestinians.

In January, Israel launched a major operation called ""Operation Iron Wall"" against Palestinian armed groups in the northern West Bank, saying it aimed to ""defeat terrorism"".

Türk said his office had verified that Israeli state and settler violence had killed at least 909 Palestinians across the West Bank since 7 October 2023, including 191 children and five people with disabilities. He warned that some of the killings might amount to extrajudicial and other unlawful killings.

Over the same period, 51 Israelis, including 15 women and four children, had been killed in Palestinian attacks or armed clashes in the West Bank and Israel, he said.

Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.

Belgian prince loses bid for benefits on top of £300k royal allowance,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g703x0l14o,BBC,Laura Gozzi,7/4/2025,"A Belgian prince's attempt to claim social security benefits on top of his six-figure royal allowance has been rejected by a court.

Prince Laurent - the younger brother of King Philippe - received €388,000 (£295,850; $376,000) from state funds last year but said that his work entitles him and his family to social security.

He had argued that he was partly self-employed because of the duties he carries out as a royal, as well as running an animal welfare charity for the past decade.

Laurent, 61, said he was acting out of ""principle"" rather than for money. The court disagreed.

""When a migrant comes here, he registers, he has a right to [social security],"" he told Belgian broadcaster RTBF.

""I may be a migrant too, but one whose family established the state in place.""

But on Monday a court in Brussels turned down Laurent's request on the grounds that the prince can be considered neither self-employed nor an employee.

However, according to broadcaster VTM the judge acknowledged that the prince should actually be entitled to a pension - but said gaps in legislation made that impossible and called for the law to be amended.

His lawyer, Olivier Rijckaert, told Belgian newspaper Le Soir that Laurent's request had not been based on a ""whim"" and insisted on its symbolism, saying that social security is ""granted by Belgian law to all residents, from the most deprived to the richest"".

Mr Rijckaert also said that most of the prince's allowance is spent on his assistant's salary and various travel expenses.

This means Laurent is left with about €5000 (£4300; $5500) a month but no social security benefits, such as the right to claim back some medical expenses.

The prince – who has three adult children with British-born wife Claire Coombs – has also expressed his concerns over his family's wellbeing since the royal allowance will be cut when he dies.

Laurent took legal action against the Belgian state after his application for social security was refused. A first hearing was held in November 2024.

According to RTBF, the prince and his legal counsel have not yet decided whether to appeal the court's decision.

Laurentm who is the 15th in the Belgian line of succession, is no stranger to controversy and is sometimes termed theprince maudit- the ""cursed prince"" - in Belgium.

In 2018, the Belgian federal parliament voted todock his monthly allowance for a yearafter he attended a Chinese embassy reception without government permission, in full naval uniform.

He has also racked upseveral speeding finesand has been criticised for attending meetings in Libya when the late Muammar Gaddafi was still in power.

Myanmar fighting continues despite post-earthquake ceasefires,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31wk21zveo,BBC,BBC Burmese,7/4/2025,"Fighting has been reported in Myanmar despite the military junta and a rebel group alliance announcing temporary ceasefires to support earthquake relief.

As of Friday, the military had carried out at least 14 attacks since the ceasefire, according to reports received by the UN Human Rights office.

The military accused two rebel groups in the alliance that declared a ceasefire of carrying out attacks. One group said fighting broke out in response to ""offensives"" by the military.

Maj Gen Zaw Min Tun, military council spokesman, issued a general statement saying ""we will respond if military bases are attacked without reason"". An army spokesman did not respond to BBC Burmese's request for comment.

UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk urged ""a halt to all military operations"" and a focus ""on assisting those impacted by the quake, as well as ensuring unhindered access to humanitarian organisations"" following the 7.7 magnitude quake on 28 March.

A civil war has been ongoing between the junta - which seized power in a 2021 coup - and ethnic militias and resistance forces across the country.

The military councildeclareda 20-day ceasefire on 2 April, after the alliance made up of three rebel groups had announced one.

The official death toll from the earthquake in Myanmar rose to 3,564 on Monday, according to state media. Another 5,012 people were injured and 210 people remain missing.

More than a week after the earthquake, rescue workers were recovering bodies from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Mandalay over the weekend, state media reported.

Rain also fell over the weekend, which aid groups said could hamper relief efforts.

The UN Human Rights office said on Friday that while humanitarian efforts had progressed in areas where access had been granted, ""longstanding limitations imposed by the military on humanitarian operations and access"" meant that multiple badly affected areas ""have remained inaccessible to humanitarian emergency assistance – except for what can be organised locally by residents"".

UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said in a video filmed in Mandalay on Saturday that people ""need food. They need water. They need the power back on. They're telling me that they need shelter"".

Aftershocks continue, with a 4.9 magnitude earthquake recorded over the weekend, and people are ""living with that trauma"", he said.

Before the earthquake, almost 20 million people were already in need in this community, he added.

""So it's a compounding crisis. It's earthquake, on top of conflict, on top of huge existing need,"" he said.

Billionaire Trump backer warns of 'economic nuclear winter' over tariffs,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lzjnj79rdo,BBC,James FitzGerald,7/4/2025,"A billionaire backer of Donald Trump has urged the US president to pause his recently announced trade tariffs, or risk ""a self-induced, economic nuclear winter"".

Amid market turmoil, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said the president should take three months to allow countries to renegotiate their trading relationships with the US.

On Monday, Mr Ackman's warning was echoed by another prominent Wall Street figure, with JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon saying that Trump's tariffs risked pushing up prices for Americans.

Despite the shockwaves, the American president has defended his new import taxes, saying ""sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something"".

He says the move will boost his country with new jobs and investment, but economists warn that prices could rise for Americans and spark a trade war.

Share prices in Europe and Asia continued to plummet on Monday, as markets react to the sweeping, global tariffs announced by Trump last week.

Inhis post on Xon Sunday, Mr Ackman acknowledged the Trump argument that the global trade system had ""disadvantaged"" the US.

But, he wrote, tariffs that Trump had imposed were ""massive and disproportionate"", and did not distinguish between American friends and enemies.

Mr Ackman, the billionaire founder of Pershing Square hedge fund management company, became a high-profile supporter of Trump, a Republican, in July 2024.

He had previously backed the rival Democratic Party, and his intervention was seen as an important electoral endorsement from the world of business.

In his announcements last week, Trump unveiled a 10% ""baseline"" tariff on imports to the US, with higher rates of up to 50% faced by dozens of other countries - including a number of important manufacturing centres in Asia.

Numerous countries have vowed to respond, and China has already retaliated with new tariffs of its own on goods imported from the US.

Trump had launched an ""economic war against the whole world at once"" that risked shattering investor confidence in the US, Mr Ackman commented.

Mr Ackman said the American leader now had ""an opportunity to call a 90-day time out, negotiate and resolve unfair asymmetric tariff deals, and induce trillions of dollars of new investment in our country"".

His post on Sunday indicated that he felt the ball was back in Trump's court - after an earlier message on X which urged leaders of other countries to ""pick up the phone"" to make a deal with Trump.

As stock markets around the world continue their slump on Monday, the head of banking giant JPMorgan Chase offered his own take, warning of ""many uncertainties"" around the new tariffs policy.

In a letter to shareholders, Mr Dimon said the tariffs will ""likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession"".

""The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,"" he wrote.

Trump's officials have downplayed the recession risk. The baseline 10% tariff is already in effect, with the higher rates faced by some countries due to come into effect on Wednesday.

Speaking aboard the presidential plane on a flight back to Washington DC on Sunday, Trump himself said European and Asian countries were ""dying to make a deal"".

US defends tariffs on remote island of penguins and seals,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce84jr5mvnno,BBC,Ottilie Mitchell,7/4/2025,"The US Commerce Secretary has defended the country's decision to impose tariffs on a group of uninhabited islands, which are populated only by penguins and seals.

The imposition of tariffs on the Heard and McDonald islands were meant to close ""ridiculous loopholes"" and would prevent other countries from shipping through the islands to reach the US, Howard Lutnick told the BBC's US partner CBS.

Authorities in Australia reacted with surprise last week when they found out about the tariffs on the island, which sits 4,000km (2,485 mi) from Australia.

Its trade minister Don Farrell told news outlet ABC that the imposition of tariffs was ""clearly a mistake"" indicating a ""rushed process"".

But when asked about the inclusion of the Australian territory on Trump's tariffs list, Lutnick said: ""If you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.""

""The President knows that, he's tired of it, and he's going to fix that.""

Lutnick's interview was one of several given by US government officials to defend the president's new tariffs after all three major stock indexes in the US plunged more than 5% on Friday, inthe worst week for the US stock market since 2020.

Shipping products through one port to another in a process known as transshipment is common in global trade. But Pew Charitable Trusts, a public policy organisation, says this method can also ""enable bad actors to obscure or manipulate data"" around the shipping events.

The NGO estimates thathundreds of millions of dollars of tuna and similar species are illegally moved via this method in the western and central Pacific each year.

It's difficult to get a clear picture on the imports from the Heard and McDonald islands to the US.

According to export data from the World Bank, the islands have, over the past few years, usually exported a small amount of products to the US.

Butin 2022 the US imported US$1.4m (A$2.23m; £1.08m)) from the territory, nearly all of it unnamed ""machinery and electrical"" products.

Also included on Trump's list was the British Indian Ocean territory, which is solely occupied by military personnel and requires a permit to visit. World Bank export data showsthe territory exported US$414,350 to the US in 2022.

'Sometimes you have to take medicine': Trump stands by his trade policies,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2093qgx14po,BBC,Bernd Debusmann Jr,7/4/2025,"US President Donald Trump has defended sweeping tariffs on imports that sent shockwaves through global stock markets, saying ""sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something"".

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late on Sunday, he said jobs and investment would return to the US to make it ""wealthy like never before"".

Trump's top officials stressed that the tariffs - announced last week - would be implemented as planned, playing down recession fears.

Just hours after Trump's comments, stock markets plunged in Asia early on Monday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping by 7.8%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing more than 12%.

On Friday, all three major stock indexes in the US fell more than 5%, while the S&P 500 dropped almost 6% inthe worst week for the US stock market since 2020.

Saudi Arabia's stock exchange - which trades on Sundays - ended nearly 7% lower, its biggest daily loss since the pandemic, state-owned media said.

US banking giant JP Morgan has predicted a 60% chance of a US and global recession following Trump's tariffs announcement.

Speaking aboard the presidential plane on a flight back to Washington DC, Trump said European and Asian countries were ""dying to make a deal"".

He also pushed back against a reporter's inquiry about American consumers' ""pain threshold"" as fears of steep price increases and a market recession grow.

""I think your question is so stupid,"" he told the reporter. ""I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

In a series of TV interviews earlier on Sunday, Trump's top officials also played down recent stock market falls.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told NBC's Meet the Press programme that there was ""no reason"" to expect a recession as a result. ""This is an adjustment process,"" he added.

Bessent also argued that Trump had ""created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation"".

Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News that the 10% ""baseline"" tariff on all imports, which came into effect a day earlier, will definitely ""stay in place for days and weeks"".

Lutnick went on say the steeper reciprocal tariffs were still on track.

Higher custom tariffs on roughly 60 countries, dubbed the ""worst offenders"", are due to come into effect on Wednesday 9 April.

When asked about these tariffs, Lutnick said they were coming. ""[Trump] announced it and he wasn't kidding,"" he said.

Lutnick also defended tariffs imposed ontwo tiny Antarctic islandspopulated only by penguins, saying it was to close ""loopholes"" for countries such as China to ""ship through"".



Elsewhere, Indonesia and Taiwan have said over the weekend that they will not impose retaliatory tariffs after the US announced a 32% levy on imports from both countries.

Vietnam's leader, To Lam, has asked Trump to delay a 46% duty on Vietnamese exports to the US by ""at least 45 days"", according to a letter seen by news agency AFP and the New York Times.

However, China announced on Friday thatit will impose a 34% tariffon all US imports, beginning on Thursday 10 April.

UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer warned on Saturday that ""the world as we knew it has gone"".

Starmer said the UK government would keep pushing for an economic deal with the US that avoided some of the tariffs.

A Downing Street spokesman added Starmer and new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney agreed in a phone call that ""an all-out trade war is in no-one's interest"".

On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to meet Trump for trade talks in Washington DC.

Netanyahu, speaking to reporters as he boarded a plane-bound for the US, said he would be ""the first international leader that is meeting with Trump"" since the new tariffs were introduced.

He said this showed their ""personal connection and the connection between our countries that is so essential in this time"".

Anti-Trump protests were held in cities across the USover the weekend, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January.

Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities, with protesters citing grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues.

Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77njdlvj66o,BBC,Simon Jack,7/4/2025,"The sharp fall in stock markets across the world shows no sign of letting up after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs and many are asking does this qualify as a stock market ""crash"" and what that could mean for them?

The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.

On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls.

That was most definitely a crash.

In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.

By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.

The UK FTSE index has fallen sharply though not by as much.

This is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.

Follow live updates

Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.

A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a ""bear market"" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.

While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types – defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.

That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off – but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a ""safe haven"" along with other assets such as gold.

That is exactly what has happened here.

Government bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.

The closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.

There have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment – and pension savings is a long term game.

It does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.

The markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.

So the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.

Falls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.

But that's not to say this is not a very big moment for the world economy.

This City is Ours: James Nelson-Joyce on the 'Scouse Sopranos',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62gjj774ldo,BBC,Paul Glynn,7/4/2025,"In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.

So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the ""Scouse Sopranos"" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.

Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.

Inconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.

It's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's ""most amazing"" TV experience to date.

""It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,"" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.

""Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,"" he adds. ""It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.""

He believes it is important to show on screen how ""we are allowed to change"".

""Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.

""Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.""

The rising star,who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.

And he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.

He says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as ""a gift"" of a co-star and a ""kind human being"".

Graham is ""so supportive"" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's ownheadline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.

This City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played ""hard men"" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate ""all of the other qualities"" he possesses, until now.

The Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a ""superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties"". Critic Anita Singh noted that it ""doesn't quite live up to"" the Sopranos ""but it comes close"".

Ina four-star review, the Independentsaid Nelson-Joyce's ""conflicted gangster"" and the show's ""moral ambivalence"" elevated it ""above the average boilerplate crime drama"".

The Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting ""the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.""

Butthe Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it ""is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence"".

The show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is ""happy"" with comparisons to the ""brilliant"" New Jersey-based crime show ""because that really is about a family"".

""We haven't got as many cured meats,"" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.

Another reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to ""explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.""

""Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,"" he adds.

Former engineer Butchard was keen to capture the ""vibrancy"" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a ""really handsome"" and ""friendly"" modern world city.

Beautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).

""I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,"" he says.

""Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.""

He says he was was impressed with the ""wonderful"" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.

As for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.

""We want to do a season two"" says the star.

""It would be mad if there wasn't"" offers Dibb.

Both underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.

""Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,"" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would ""not hold back"" in saying so if not.

He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had ""done they city proud"".

The reaction has been ""really lovely"" and ""a bit crazy"" adds Nelson-Joyce.

""It feels like the whole city loves it,"" he says. ""I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.""

His celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was ""[expletive] brilliant"".

Tony Soprano could not have put it better himself.

The tennis prodigy who turned into an international basketball star,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c62x962xd0po,BBC,,7/4/2025,"Josh Ward-Hibbert in the Boys Single at Wimbledon in 2012 and on the basketball court for Great Britain

Few of us sports enthusiasts can claim to have mastered one sport. Josh Ward-Hibbert has conquered two.

The man himself refutes that idea, preferring to describe himself as ""blessed"", but the evidence is clear.

A Grand Slam tennis champion as a junior, Ward-Hibbert has gone on to become a Great Britain international at basketball.

Now 31, Ward-Hibbert is a key part of the Newcastle Eagles basketball team aiming to conquer new ground in Europe, thrilled at what life has given him.

""I feel blessed,"" he told BBC Sport.

Josh Ward-Hibbert joined Newcastle Eagles from London Lions in 2023

""There are lots of super-talented people who play some sports and you hear commentators say, 'That kind of athleticism, they could be good at this or this.'

""My parents and coaches made it possible for me to do both.""

On Tuesday, Ward-Hibbert's sporting journey has him to Bratislava in Slovakia as the Eagles compete in the European North Basketball League Final Four.

Newcastle play Polish side Dziki Warsaw in the semi-final, with the chance to face either Inter Bratislava or Romanian side CSO Voluntari in the final.

Both the Eagles and Ward-Hibbert have a raft of domestic winners' medals, but winning a European trophy is a new frontier, and they are determined to add to their legacy.

It is further proof of how the Mansfield-born athlete has been excelling since he was young.

Growing up, Josh's life was packed with sport. Parents Michael and Shelley would be ferrying him from tennis practice to the basketball court most nights a week.

They did not pressure him to pick one over the other, while coaches worked to accommodate each sport.

He had been part of the England Under-16 basketball team, but when the time came to choose, he opted for tennis.

Liam Broady (left) and Josh Ward-Hibbert after winning the 2012 Australian Open junior doubles title

Close friendships were formed as Ward-Hibbert travelled the world playing tennis, and in 2012 he reached the pinnacle as he teamed up with Liam Broady to win the Australian Open junior doubles title.

Ward-Hibbert turned professional and won one singles title and 13 doubles titles on the ITF Futures circuit, including five with Broady and four with Lloyd Glasspool, another who is now a regular on the main ATP doubles circuit.

But he struggled to progress beyond that, and at 22 he decided to step away from tour life to go to Loughborough University to further his education.

""There were a few things that happened in my personal life, and I had a little injury that kept recurring and was not going away how I wanted it to,"" he said.

""Everything just combined to put me to a tipping point.

""Tennis is a super-tough sport, physically and mentally. You are always travelling, you are constantly living out of a suitcase.

""No matter where it is, you have got to live it. It's difficult, it's very much a lifestyle, 45, 50 weeks of the year.""

But Ward-Hibbert would not be without his tennis career.

""It is an amazing sport. There were so many highs, it taught me so much as a person, and the kind of person I am today is from the journey I had.

""I'm definitely glad I had that journey. It would be remiss not to say I wish I had got to world number one, but that wasn't in my path.

""I got to win a Grand Slam with one of my closest friends still to this day. That is a memory I am never going to forget.""

Ward-Hibbert had not played any basketball for a few years, but while at university, his love was rekindled.

From playing a few games for Derby Trailblazers to getting his eye back in with a friend who had come over from America, he was recruited by the Leicester Riders in the British Basketball League.

""I just wanted to figure out my next move and the basketball thing just fell,"" he said.

""I picked up the ball and just ran with it, and I've been running ever since. I kept having opportunities and big decisions to make and a lot of positive things have happened from that.

""I love basketball the same as I love tennis, so it was going from one love to another love.""

From that point, success and Ward-Hibbert, who measures 6ft 5in (1.96m) in height, have gone hand in hand.

He picked up seven trophies with the Riders and then three more from a stint with London Lions before heading north to join the Eagles in 2023.

""I always believed in myself as a basketball player,"" he said.

""I believed I had good ability, kept working hard and doing the best thing I could whilst also studying, and a lot of great things happened.

""I've represented my country, I've got a lot of accolades and trophies in the British game, and hopefully there are plenty more to add, too.""

Josh Ward-Hibbert is aiming to deliver a first European trophy for Newcastle Eagles

In January, Ward-Hibbert helped Newcastlewin the SLB Trophy, beating Bristol Flyers in the final for the club's first piece of silverware since 2021.

It was a 28th trophy for the most successful British club, but now they want European glory.

And with the city's football team endinga 70-year waitto win a cup final at Wembley last month, the basketball team are determined to ride that wave.

""The legacy of Newcastle Eagles doesn't need to be spoken about, it's massive,"" added Ward-Hibbert.

""But we feel as a team, we are trying to establish our own legacy. We are paving the way this season, winning the cup, adding another trophy to the organisation.

""We've won the group in the European North Basketball League, the first British team to ever top a group in a European competition.

""We're already setting legacies in that regard, but to come away with the trophy is something that we are striving to get to.

""All the players and staff want to come back to Newcastle and say we won that trophy.

""We want to bring something back, the same way the football team did.""

Ward-Hibbert's love for both sports is clear. And when basketball takes a break in the summer, he will still be tempted to pick up a tennis racket and send down a few serves.

But which is better? Winning as an individual or being part of a winning team?

""Winning something amazing and celebrating in the locker room with all the guys in basketball is an unbelievable feeling,"" he said.

""That is special, but then you have a long, gruelling tennis match and the second after winning that last point to win the match, that feeling is pretty unrivalled.

""Tennis is an individual sport but there is so much camaraderie in it with your coach, physio, strength and conditioning coach, other players you are travelling with.

""Regardless of what was happening, if I wasn't playing, I always wanted to see my friends do well and I am pretty sure it was vice versa.

""There was so much camaraderie and a real team aspect to it. It's the same with basketball, but on the flip side, a lot of players have probably been on teams where there is not a lot of camaraderie and felt solo and isolated.

""It's an interesting debate, but for me it's completely situational.""

Mother of man shot dead by UK police hopes TV drama will 'show world the truth',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9lnw9ywp5o,BBC,Adina Campbell,6/4/2025,"The 80-year-old mother of a man shot dead in a Tube station by police who mistook him for a terror suspect says she will continue to fight for him and ""show the world the truth"".

Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes was shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder by two police marksmen in Stockwell underground station on 22 July 2005.

His family have flown to London ahead of a new Disney+ four-part UK TV drama  which looks at the events surrounding the 27-year-old's death.

The Metropolitan Police says the shooting is a matter of very deep regret. ""Our thoughts remain with his family and we reiterate our apology to them.""

Ahead of the 20th anniversary of her son's death, Maria de Menezes told BBC News she never wants to see other mothers suffer in the way she has.

She hopes the drama series will portray her son's true character and shed light on his story.

""I was reassured that the truth was being told,"" she says. ""They were going to be truthful about the story unlike other media outlets and other reports previously which told lies.""

She says she wanted the real story portrayed after incorrect initial reports that he jumped the barriers and hit police.

""It really annoys me because I know him. He came from me... My son was educated, civilised, who always respected law and order.""

The drama series is told from multiple perspectives and examines what happened to the Brazilian electrician before, during and after he was pinned down by officers and shot in the head.

His brother, Giovani da Silva, says their family were consultants during the making of the series and believe the full story will now become clear to the world.

""We are very happy that the truth about my brother's life is being told. The life of struggle, his roots in rural Brazil and how he moved to another country in search of a better life.""

Mr de Menezes was killed the day after failed bombing attempts on the London transport network, two weeks after the 7/7 bombings in central London.

No officers were prosecuted for the killing but the Met was fined for breaching health and safety laws.

In 2016, the family lost a human rights challenge over the decision not to charge any police officer for the fatal shooting.

The Metropolitan Police says the circumstances around his death ""came at a time of unprecedented terrorist threat to London"".

A spokesperson said the force had been subject to numerous public inquiries, including two separate reports by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (now the IOPC).

""No officer sets out on duty intent on ending a life. Our sole purpose is the complete opposite – the protection and preservation of life – and we have taken extensive action to address the causes of this tragedy.""

Shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes

The drama has been written and executively produced by Jeff Pope who says it's been five years in the making.

""It's taken an awful long time and there's a reason for that, because it's a huge responsibility and wasn't something that you could short-circuit.

""It was an incredibly difficult piece to wrangle and understand what you wanted to say. It was enormously important to speak to as many people as possible and to do the research. Every last detail.""

The family says the loss of Jean still echoes in their hearts. His cousin Vivian Figueiredo, who breaks down in tears during the interview, says Jean's mother will never give up.

""It's just the obligation that she feels to fight for justice for him. She's 80, she just left this small town in Brazil, the other side of the world, to come here just to fight for him.

""The police should really be careful, not just suspect and kill because a life is priceless.""

Towards the end of the interview, Vivian looks at her aunt and tells her she's brave. Maria hugs her and says: ""It's not about being brave. It's about fighting, fighting to live.""

Suspect: The Shooting of Jean Charles De Menezes is available on Disney+ from 30 April, 2025.

N Korea holds first international marathon in six years,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq7l09z5e5o,BBC,Kelly Ng,7/4/2025,"North Korea has held the Pyongyang International Marathon for the first time in six years, welcoming some 200 foreign runners to the streets of the reclusive country's capital.

The marathon, which was launched in 1981, took place annually in April to celebrate the birth of its founding leader Kim Il Sung.

Before Sunday's marathon, the race was last held in 2019, wherein 950 foreigners participated. North Korea sealed itself off the following year, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit.

North Korea has been slow to reopen since, allowing only Russian tourists into its capital since last year.

Runners have had to enter the country as part of an organised tour group, as was the case before the pandemic.

Koryo Tours, a Beijing-based travel agency listed as an ""exclusive partner"" on the event website, offers six-day marathon tours at 2,195 euros ($2,406) including flights to and from Beijing.

""The Pyongyang Marathon is an extremely unique experience as it provides an opportunity to interact with locals,"" the agency wrote on its website.

Sunday's marathon route took participants past landmarks across the city, including the Kim Il Sung stadium, the Arch of Triumph built to commemorate Kim Il Sung's role in resisting Japanese rule, and the Mirae Future Scientists' Street said to be a residential district for scientists and engineers.

Pictures online show the stadium - where runners start and finish their race - filled with spectators, many of them cheering and waving gold-coloured paper flags.

Pak Kum Dong, a North Korean runner, told Reuters news agency: ""The eyes of our people on me helped me to bear the difficulties whenever I feel tired.""

There is no publicly available information on race results.

North Korea had only statred to scale back Covid-19 restrictions in the middle of 2023.

In Feburary, it allowed some Western tourists into the remote, eastern city Rason, butsuspended those toursjust weeks after.

This City is Ours: James Nelson-Joyce on the 'Scouse Sopranos',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62gjj774ldo,BBC,Paul Glynn,7/4/2025,"In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.

So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the ""Scouse Sopranos"" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.

Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.

Inconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.

It's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's ""most amazing"" TV experience to date.

""It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,"" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.

""Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,"" he adds. ""It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.""

He believes it is important to show on screen how ""we are allowed to change"".

""Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.

""Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.""

The rising star,who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.

And he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.

He says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as ""a gift"" of a co-star and a ""kind human being"".

Graham is ""so supportive"" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's ownheadline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.

This City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played ""hard men"" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate ""all of the other qualities"" he possesses, until now.

The Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a ""superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties"". Critic Anita Singh noted that it ""doesn't quite live up to"" the Sopranos ""but it comes close"".

Ina four-star review, the Independentsaid Nelson-Joyce's ""conflicted gangster"" and the show's ""moral ambivalence"" elevated it ""above the average boilerplate crime drama"".

The Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting ""the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.""

Butthe Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it ""is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence"".

The show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is ""happy"" with comparisons to the ""brilliant"" New Jersey-based crime show ""because that really is about a family"".

""We haven't got as many cured meats,"" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.

Another reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to ""explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.""

""Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,"" he adds.

Former engineer Butchard was keen to capture the ""vibrancy"" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a ""really handsome"" and ""friendly"" modern world city.

Beautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).

""I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,"" he says.

""Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.""

He says he was was impressed with the ""wonderful"" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.

As for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.

""We want to do a season two"" says the star.

""It would be mad if there wasn't"" offers Dibb.

Both underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.

""Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,"" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would ""not hold back"" in saying so if not.

He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had ""done they city proud"".

The reaction has been ""really lovely"" and ""a bit crazy"" adds Nelson-Joyce.

""It feels like the whole city loves it,"" he says. ""I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.""

His celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was ""[expletive] brilliant"".

Tony Soprano could not have put it better himself.

This City Is Ours airs on BBC One on Sundays at 21:00 BST. All eight episodes are available now on iPlayer.

Thousands attend funeral of songwriter Amadou Bagayoko,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0zq4elez9o,BBC,Mark Savage,7/4/2025,"Thousands of people gathered in Mali on Sunday for the funeral of musician Amadou Bagayoko, of the world-renowned duo Amadou & Mariam.

Friends, relatives, fans and fellow artists flocked to the ceremony in the capital, Bamako - including musician Salif Keita and former prime minister Moussa Mara.

One of the most successful African musical acts of the 2000s, husband and wife duo Amadou & Mariam achieved global fame by combining West African influences with rhythm and blues.

Their breakthrough album, 2004's Dimanche à Bamako, sold half a million copies worldwide and led to collaborations with Blur's Damon Albarn, as well as appearances at the Glastonbury and Coachella festivals.

Mali's culture minister, Mamou Daffé, said on state TV that Bagayoko had died on Friday in Bamako at the age of 70.

The musician's family confirmed the news, adding that he ""had been ill for a while"".

No further information was given on the cause of death, but his widow, Mariam Doumbia, described her husband's last moments.

""I took his hand and tried to make some movements with it, but it didn't move,"" she said.

""I said, 'Amadou, don't do this, speak to Mariam... but he didn't speak any more.""

The musician was taken to hospital, where he subsequently died.

""I thought that, if Amadou went just like that, then me, I'm alone,"" Doumbia added.

""I was alone and I will remain alone in life.""

Franco-Spanish star Manu Chao, who produced Dimanche à Bamako, led tributes to Bagayoko in a post on Instagram, saying: ""We will always be together... Wherever you go.

""Mariam, Sam, the whole family, your pain is my pain. I love you,"" he added.

Young Malian singer Sidiki Diabate lamented ""another immense loss for Malian music"".

Youssou N'Dour said he considered Amadou & Mariam to be ""the ambassadors of African music almost everywhere in the world"".

Speaking to France's TV5 Monde, he said Bagayoko had pursued his career with ""a dignity and a way of life that inspired us all... and encouraged us in what we were doing"".

Born in Bamako in 1954, Bagayoko went blind when he was 15 because of a congenital cataract.

He subsequently enrolled at Mali's Institute for the Young Blind, where he met his future wife, Mariam, who had lost her vision at the age of five after contracting measles.

They formed a band called Mali's Blind Couple in 1980, and moved to the neighbouring Ivory Coast in 1986, having realised that Mali's under-developed music industry would be a hindrance to their career.

There, they recorded a series of cassettes, pairing Doumbia's soulful voice with Bagayoko's powerful guitar style, inspired by British acts like Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd.

The aim, Bagayoko said, was to ""find a link between them and our Bambara culture"". He christened the sound ""Afro-rock"".

Their lives were changed when Manu Chao heard one of their songs on the radio and offered to produce their next album.

He ended up co-writing and singing on the record, adding eccentric rhythmical touches to their brand of desert blues.

The result was Dimanche à Bamako, which won both the Victoire de la Musique - France's equivalent to a Grammy Award - and the BBC Radio World Music Award in 2005.

Their follow-up, 2008's Welcome to Mali, was nominated for best contemporary world music album at the Grammys.

That record was produced by Albarn, who had invited the duo to take part in his Africa Express project in 2007, and invited them to tour with Blur during their 2009 reunion shows.

Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters was also a fan, and took Amadou & Mariam on the road with his band in 2012.

""What they do hearkens back to classic rock and real musicianship,"" he told the Times as the tour kicked off.

""Now with all bands, when you're playing live, everybody's got backing tracks going on. Everyone's working with a net. They are a proper old-school rock band.""

In 2009, they played in Oslo as Barack Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; and in 2011 staged a series of concerts in the dark to show audiences how they experienced music.

A year later, they decided to record two versions of their sixth album Folila - one in New York and one with traditional musicians in Bamako.

The idea was to release each separately but, in the end, the duo decided to combine the recordings, mixing different takes of the same song together in a third studio in Paris.

Featuring contributions from Santigold, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV On The Radio, it earned the group a second Grammy nomination in 2012.

2017's La Confusion, addressed the political turmoil in their homeland, where Islamic extremists had imposed Sharia law and banished music.

Songs like Bofou Safou offered messages of strength, resistance and optimism amidst the turmoil. Bagayoko said he hoped the music was universal

""We started to work on the things that were happening in our homeland, but then realised that they could be applied to a lot of other countries in the world,""he told OkayAfrica.

""There is a confusion all over the world, and it's time to communicate, to talk and share ideas for a better future and understanding.""

The duo had been due to go on a European tour in May and June, including UK dates in Cheltenham in Brighton.

Bagayoko's final performance came at the closing ceremony of the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games.

He is survived by his wife and a son, Sam, also a musician.

Bagayoko ""will be buried in family intimacy in the courtyard of his home"", his spokesman Djiby Sacko told the AFP news agency.

Mali accuses Algeria of sponsoring terror after downing drone,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c045zp1l3nko,BBC,Chris Ewokor,7/4/2025,"Mali has accused neighbouring Algeria of being a sponsor and exporter of terrorism after Algeria shot down a Malian drone close to their common border last week.

A strongly worded statement from Mali's foreign ministry on Sunday challenged Algeria's earlier explanation that the unmanned surveillance aircraft had violated its airspace.

The statement described the downing of the drone as a ""hostile premeditated action"". Algeria has not responded to the accusation.

Mali's armed forces are fighting ethnic Tuareg separatists in the north. They have a stronghold in the town of Tinzaoutin, which straddles the Mali-Algeria border.

The shooting down of the drone marks a significant escalation of diplomatic tension, as Mali, along with its allies Niger and Burkina Faso, have recalled their ambassadors from Algiers.

Last year, the three junta-led countries formed a regional bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States, known by its French acronym AES.

In their joint statement condemning Algeria, they said the shooting down of the drone ""prevented the neutralisation of a terrorist group that was planning terrorist acts against the AES"".

Mali has also summoned the Algerian ambassador in Bamako over the incident, declaring that it would file a complaint with ""international bodies"". It also withdrew from a regional security grouping that includes Algeria.

Last Wednesday, Algeria acknowledged that it had shot down an ""armed reconnaissance drone"" close to Tinzaoutin saying it had ""penetrated our airspace over a distance of 2km"".

But the junta in Bamako denied that the drone had violated Algeria's airspace. It said that the aircraft's wreckage was found 9.5km inside its borders.

Mali regularly accuses Algeria of giving shelter to Tuareg armed groups.

The north African country once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali and the separatists. Their relations have soured since 2020 after the military took power in Bamako.

Algeria recently deployed troops along its borders to prevent the infiltration of militants and weapons from jihadist groups who operate in Mali and other countries in West Africa's Sahel region.

It's only early April and north India is bracing for extreme heat,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn741gg73o,BBC,Nikita Yadav,7/4/2025,"India's weather department has warned of high temperatures in parts of northern India, including capital Delhi, for this week.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said northern and central states - including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat - can expect maximum temperatures to cross 40C.

It has issued a yellow alert which means that the heat is tolerable for the general public but can cause moderate health concerns for infants, the elderly and people with chronic diseases.

Northern India usually sees heatwaves between April and June, but in recent years, global warming and climate change have caused extreme temperatures to arrive earlier and last longer.

According to the IMD forecast, the highest temperature in Delhi is expected to hit 41C on Monday afternoon. The average temperature for the city last year was 37C.

People have been advised to avoid heat exposure, wear lightweight and breathable cotton clothing and cover their heads with a cloth or umbrella outdoors.

The capital recorded a maximum temperature of 38.2C on Sunday.

Last week, IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said most parts of India wouldexperience an intense heatwavethis summer, with above-normal temperatures expected across most of the country.

States like Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mr Mohapatra said.

""From April to June, most parts of north and east India, central India and the plains of north-west are expected to experience two-to-four more heatwave days than normal,"" he added.

Heatwaves usually start occurring in northern India from the end of April, but we are seeing that their occurrence has recently been exacerbated by climate change, says Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology and climate change at weather forecasting company Skymet.

""We go straight from winter to summer; the spring season in northern India is shrinking,"" he said.

""In the coming days, we will see wind speeds slowing down with clear skies. This naturally leads to a rise in temperature,"" Mr Palawat added.

Last year, India recorded its hottest day ever at 50.5C in Rajasthan state. More than 40,000 suspected cases of heatstroke were also reported.

One weather station in Delhi in May recordeda maximum temperature of 52.9C, although the government later said it was due to a sensor error andrevised it downby 3C.

Nearly 150 people died due to the heatwave in 2024, according to official data but independent researchers said the toll was much higher.

Outcry over emir's summons prompts U-turn from Nigerian police,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w0nl2y80o,BBC,Mansur Abubakar,7/4/2025,"Nigerian police have withdrawn a summons issued to one of the country's most respected traditional leaders after it was widely condemned.

The emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi, is engaged in a tussle for the crown with his cousin Aminu Ado Bayero, who is said to enjoy the support of the national government.

Prior to the recent Eid al-Fitr celebration, police in Kano banned the annual horse parade, or durbar, fearing trouble between supporters of the rival claimants.

However, Sanusi chose to ride on horseback after Eid prayers, accompanied by local vigilantes.

This led to clashes between rivals groups which saw one man stabbed to death, prompting the police to order Sanusi to appear at the national police headquarters in the capital, Abuja.

However, this prompted an outcry with many Nigerians saying it showed a lack of respect to the emirate, which is one of the oldest institutions in the country.

Traditional leaders in Nigeria hold few constitutional powers but are able to exert significant influence as they are seen as custodians of both religion and tradition.

In response to the strong reaction against the summons and following the intervention of ""respected stakeholders"", Nigeria's police chief said that officers would instead go to Kano to obtain Sanusi's statement.

The emir has not commented on the summons.

Sanusi returned to the Kano throne last year after he was ousted in 2020 for ""insubordination'' to the then Kano state government under Abdullahi Ganduje.

Sanusi, a former head of Nigeria's central bank, was reappointed by Kano's current Governor Abba Kabir Yusuf last May, and Bayero was sacked after four years as emir.

However, some of Bayero's supporters have gone to court, maintaining he is the rightful emir.

While Sanusi is living in the emir's official residence, Bayero is residing in one of the emirate's smaller palaces.

A year later, they decided to record two versions of their sixth album Folila - one in New York and one with traditional musicians in Bamako.

The idea was to release each separately but, in the end, the duo decided to combine the recordings, mixing different takes of the same song together in a third studio in Paris.

British woman in Netflix's Con Mum charged in Singapore,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14xn65vg2yo,BBC,Kelly Ng,7/4/2025,"The British woman at the centre of a Netflix documentary on how she allegedly duped her son and left him in debt to fund her champagne-sipping lifestyle has been charged with fraud in Singapore.

Alleged victims of Dionne Marie Hanna, 84, filed police reports after watching Con Mum, local media report.

They accuse the Singapore resident of taking their money with the promise that  they would be reimbursed through her inheritance from Brunei's royal family.

The ploy is similar to the one she allegedly used against London pastry chef Graham Hornigold, after she contacted him in 2020, claiming to be his long-lost mother.

A DNA test later proved that Ms Hanna was indeed Mr Hornigold's mother.

Ms Hanna, who was charged with five counts of fraud, appeared before a district court on Saturday via video link. She was seen lying on a hospital bed, accompanied by an investigating officer, Singapore's Channel NewsAsia reported.

She is accused of deceiving three men in Singapore and France into transferring money to her accounts, claiming the funds were needed as legal fees and for the opening of new bank accounts.

Ms Hanna sought their sympathy by saying she was terminally ill and vouched to reimburse them through inheritance, claiming that she is part of the Brunei royal family. Her son questions these claims in the documentary.

In exchange for their money, she also made promises to donate millions of dollars to a mosque and a Muslim non-profit organisation in Singapore, the court heard.

It is unclear how much money her alleged victims lost, but Singapore police said preliminary investigations show she is involved in at least five cases of cheating with losses amounting to more than S$200,000 ($149,000; £115,400).

If convicted, Ms Hanna faces up to 20 years in jail and a fine.

Con Mum, which was released on Netflix on 25 March, follows Mr Hornigold's reunion with Ms Hanna in the UK during the pandemic.

She presented herself as a wealthy, illegitimate daughter of the sultan of Brunei, initially showering Mr Hornigold, his then-partner Heather Kaniuk and his friends with lavish gifts, from cars to homes.

Though initially sceptical, Mr Hornigold, who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants and founded Longboys Doughnuts, quickly developed a close relationship with his mother.

Over time however, Ms Hanna began to leave Mr Hornigold and his friends to foot her escalating bills - Mr Hornigold said in the film that he lost £300,000 - while she disappeared.

The film suggests that Ms Hanna had previously been convicted in the UK for shoplifting and fraud.

Mali accuses Algeria of sponsoring terror after downing drone,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c045zp1l3nko,BBC,Chris Ewokor,7/4/2025,"Mali has accused neighbouring Algeria of being a sponsor and exporter of terrorism after Algeria shot down a Malian drone close to their common border last week.

A strongly worded statement from Mali's foreign ministry on Sunday challenged Algeria's earlier explanation that the unmanned surveillance aircraft had violated its airspace.

The statement described the downing of the drone as a ""hostile premeditated action"". Algeria has not responded to the accusation.

Mali's armed forces are fighting ethnic Tuareg separatists in the north. They have a stronghold in the town of Tinzaoutin, which straddles the Mali-Algeria border.

The shooting down of the drone marks a significant escalation of diplomatic tension, as Mali, along with its allies Niger and Burkina Faso, have recalled their ambassadors from Algiers.

Last year, the three junta-led countries formed a regional bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States, known by its French acronym AES.

In their joint statement condemning Algeria, they said the shooting down of the drone ""prevented the neutralisation of a terrorist group that was planning terrorist acts against the AES"".

Mali has also summoned the Algerian ambassador in Bamako over the incident, declaring that it would file a complaint with ""international bodies"". It also withdrew from a regional security grouping that includes Algeria.

Last Wednesday, Algeria acknowledged that it had shot down an ""armed reconnaissance drone"" close to Tinzaoutin saying it had ""penetrated our airspace over a distance of 2km"".

But the junta in Bamako denied that the drone had violated Algeria's airspace. It said that the aircraft's wreckage was found 9.5km inside its borders.

Mali regularly accuses Algeria of giving shelter to Tuareg armed groups.

The north African country once served as a key mediator during more than a decade of conflict between Mali and the separatists. Their relations have soured since 2020 after the military took power in Bamako.

Algeria recently deployed troops along its borders to prevent the infiltration of militants and weapons from jihadist groups who operate in Mali and other countries in West Africa's Sahel region.

Cabrera returns to Masters for first time since prison,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c8rgkddm63ko,BBC,Peter Scrivener,7/4/2025,"Cabrera won the 36-hole James Hardie Pro Football Hall of Fame Invitational by two shots from KJ Choi

Former Masters champion Angel Cabrera is set to compete at Augusta National for the first time in six years following his release from prison.

The Argentine was found guilty in 2021 of numerous charges that included assault, theft and illegal intimidation against former girlfriends.

He was released in August 2023 after serving 30 months in South American prisons.

All Masters champions receive lifetime exemptions to play in the tournament but Cabrera, who also won the 2007 US Open, was unable to take up his playing privilege in 2024 because of visa issues.

Despite the convictions, Masters chairman Fred Ridley, speaking before the 2024 tournament, called Cabrera ""one of our great champions"", adding: ""He has been unable to participate in the Masters the last couple of years due to legal issues.

""We certainly wish him the best of luck with that, and we'll definitely welcome him back if he's able to straighten out those legal issues.""

Cabrera, according to a report inSports Illustrated,,externaldid not touch a golf club for three years but on his release from prison was taken a set by his long-time coach, mentor and friend Charlie Epps.

The 81-year-old Epps said ""golf is all he has left"".

On Sunday the 55-year-old won his first strokeplay title since being freed. He also triumphed in a matchplay event on the Legends Tour in England in June 2024.

""It's emotional after everything that I've gone through,"" said Cabrera after winning the James Hardie Pro Football Hall of Fame Invitational, a PGA Tour-sanctioned seniors event in Florida.

Cabrera, who won a play-off to win the Green Jacket in 2009 and also lost one in 2013 to Adam Scott, last played in the Masters in 2019.

He will also return to the annual Champions Dinner on Tuesday at Augusta National, which sees all past winners gather for a meal whose menu is chosen by the defending champion.

Host Ben Crenshaw - who won the 1984 and 1995 Masters - said: ""I'm excited to see Angel.

""The focus of the dinner will be on Scottie [Scheffler, the reigning champion], but it'll be great to have Angel back.""

Before last year's Masters, Cabrera told Golf Digest: ""It is my dream to return to that prestigious place.

""I played at Augusta for almost 20 years in a row. It is like a second home to me. It would be a great privilege to return and attend the champions dinner with so many of the world's greatest players.""

Cabrera was arrested in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, in January 2021. He had been on Interpol's Red Notice list, a worldwide request for police to arrest an individual, pending extradition.

He had been fugitive in Argentina since the previous August, after he failed to appear at a prosecutor's office following accusations of domestic violence by his partner, Cecilia Torres Mana.

Following his arrest in Brazil, he was remanded in prison until his extradition to Argentina in June 2021.

He was then convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. In November 2022, he was convicted of a second assault and sentenced to an additional two years and four months in prison.

Earlier this year, Cabrera told the Daily Mail: ""Right now, I'm fine, but I regret everything that I have done wrongly in my past, and I am also frustrated that I dumped very, very important years of my life. I made mistakes.""

The 14-year-old aiming for O'Sullivan's Crucible record,https://www.bbc.com/sport/snooker/articles/c4g2evx3548o,BBC,Sean Kearns,7/4/2025,"Michal Szubarczyk is being tipped for stardom

Michal Szubarczyk. Remember the name.

The 14-year-old is hoping to make history this week by breaking Ronnie O'Sullivan's long-standing record to become the youngest player to qualify for the World Championships at the Crucible.

The Pole has been making waves on the snooker circuit, winning the U16 and U18 European Championship titles in March.

But the teenager really caught the eye by reaching the final of the open age event, which saw him beaten by 34-year-old Liam Highfield.

That remarkable run was enough for Szubarczyk to be offered a two-year card offer on the World Snooker Tour (WST).

His performances earned praise from three-time World Champion Mark Williams, who said the teenager is""not far away"",externalfrom the level of Ronnie O'Sullivan at the same age.

But now Szubarczyk is aiming to break O'Sullivan's 33-year record by qualifying for the 2025 World Championships.

Seven-time winner O'Sullivan is the youngest-ever qualifier at the Crucible, doing so at the age of 16 in 1992. With qualifying held months in advance of the tournament proper, he was then 17 years and five months old when he made his debut at the event, losing 10-7 to Alan McManus.

2023 Champion Luca Brecel holds the record for the youngest player at the Crucible's main event, playing at the age of 17 years and 45 days in 2012.

Szubarczyk can comfortably beat both of those records as he heads into qualifying at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield on 8 April, with final round matches being played on 15 April.

The Pole faces Scotland's Dean Young in the first round, with the winner of the best-of-19-frames tie going through to face Stan Moody.

The teenager needs to win four consecutive matches to earn a spot at the Crucible.

But a victory against Young would see Szubarczyk become the youngest player to ever win a qualifying match at the World Championships, beating the record previously held by Liam Davies, who was 15 years and 277 days old when he beat Aaron Hill in 2022.

144 players enter the qualifying event at the English Institute of Sport for the World Championships.

They are hoping to secure one of the 16 places on offer at the 32-player tournament, with 16 players already automatically qualified via their ranking.

There are four qualifying rounds and players begin their campaigns at different points defending on their world ranking.

Ex-Wales fly-half Biggar to retire at end of season,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c807ye7v271o,BBC,,7/4/2025,"Dan Biggar played his final game for Wales in the 2023 Rugby World Cup quarter-final defeat against Argentina

Former British and Irish Lions and Wales fly-half Dan Biggar will retire as a player at the end of the season.

Biggar will finish his 18-year career with French club Toulon, who he joined in November 2022.

The 35-year-old won 112 caps for Wales in a 15-year Test career and scored more than 600 points. His final appearance was at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

He won three Six Nations titles and a Grand Slam with Wales and was captain during the Wayne Pivac era.

Biggar went on two British and Irish Lions tours, making three Test appearances in South Africa in 2021.

""There comes a point where you just know, not because of anything in particular, but someone once said to me 'when you know, you'll know',"" Biggar said as he announced his decision on social media.

""Rugby has given me everything. I threw myself into this game at 17 and it's given me a life that I could never have imagined.

""I've lived out my childhood dreams for the best part of two decades and I'm so, so grateful for that.""

Biggar started his youth career at Gorseinon RFC and Gowerton Comprehensive in Swansea before playing a season for Swansea RFC in the Welsh Premiership.

He made his senior Ospreys debut in 2008 and during an 11-year spell made 221 appearances and scored 2,203 points, making him the region's record points scorer.

Biggar was also instrumental in securing two Pro12 titles in 2010 and 2012 and paid tribute to a former Ospreys coach in his retirement address.

""A special mention has to go to Sean Holley, who took a chance on a young, cocky 17-year-old when public opinion told him to do otherwise. Who knows if things would have turned out if you hadn't, so thank you Sean,"" he said.

Northampton came calling in 2018 and Biggar made 69 appearances for Saints, helping them to lift the Premiership Rugby Cup and reach the league knock-out stages in his first season.

Before his contract at Franklin's Gardens expired, Biggar took an opportunity to sign for French giants Toulon, where he will see out the remainder of the 2024-2025 season.

Reflecting on his career, Biggar said there had been moments in rugby he would never forget, including winning his first cap for Wales in 2008, becoming a Test centurion in 2022 and a Lion the previous year.

But he says those are not been his greatest achievements.

""The thing I'm most proud about is being able to give my family opportunities in life, that's what means the most to me and what I'm most proud of,"" Biggar said.

""To my amazing wife Alex and my two beautiful boys I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me. You were always there to pick me up when things were low and have been by my side through everything when I've needed it. I'm very lucky.""

Biggar also remembered his late mother, who he described as his ""biggest fan"".

""The one person who isn't here to say thank you to is my mum, who sadly passed away four years ago,"" he said.

""Everything I've done over the last 18 years is because of her.""

Biggar admitted wearing the prestigious 10 shirt for Wales ""hasn't always been plain sailing and easy"", but it helped to make him a stronger person and player.

He also reflected on a difficult past year at Toulon.

""I also know that the last 12 months haven't quite gone as I'd hoped with Toulon, it's been tough and setbacks teach you a lot more about yourself and over the last 12 months I've learned a huge amount,"" he said.

""There's no real perfect moment to walk away, but this does feel like the right one.

""I'm choosing to retire, which a lot of sportspeople don't get to do when they're healthy and I feel very grateful and excited about what's coming next.

""Rugby will always be a part of me, but now it's time to give a little bit of time back to my family in this beautiful part of the world and see what challenges come next.""

Biggar finished by thanking the game of rugby itself, the people, the memories and  lessons.

""I can honestly say I gave it everything I had and now it's time for something new,"" he said.

""Thank you, diolch, merci.""

Gambler Key plays the odds in naming Brook captain,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c2lzjdl5znlo,BBC,Matthew Henry,7/4/2025,"Harry Brook is the third England captain Rob Key (left) has appointed since taking the helm at the top of England's men's cricket

Rob Key once played poker until 3am with the late great Shane Warne.

Next week he will celebrate three years in the role of managing director of England men's cricket - a period during which he has rarely been averse to a gamble.

A fiery all-rounder picked as captain, a Test coach appointed who had never led in the red-ball game and a host of youngsters given their debuts despite limited domestic records.

However, Key has played the odds in appointing Harry Brook as white-ball captain. There is a reason you are told to never risk more than you can afford to lose.

Giving the job to Ben Stokes, asKey suggested he might,would have been the equivalent to carefully building a profit across a night at the roulette table, only to throw your earnings on a lucky number with closing time in sight.

England have been building for this winter's Ashes series ever since Key and Stokes took post.

Key has wisely decided that, with the first Test in Perth seven months away, adding the white-ball captaincy to his injury-ravaged talisman's workload was one risk he was not willing to take.

Once he did so, Brook was always the obvious choice to replace Jos Buttler.

Batter Brook named England white-ball captain

'Nonsense to make Stokes white-ball captain'

Get cricket news sent straight to your phone

Domestic captains outside of the current XI, the likes of Sam Billings or James Vince, were considered but a captain must be worth their place in the team.

Joe Root was not interested, others not secure enough in their position. In some ways, Brook was the only option.

In the 26-year-old Yorkshireman, England will get another captain in the image of Stokes and Brendon McCullum - their all-format, all-powerful coach.

The similarities are in style - Brook has been a leading disciple of the pair's Test revolution - and in Brook's grounding too.

His cricket education was finished at Sedbergh School but, rather than the public-school system, he learned the game at Burley-in-Wharfedale's Hodson Park - where there is a bench bearing his late grandfather's name.

Brook, like Stokes and McCullum, is street-smart - hardened by playing in Yorkshire's tough men's leagues by the age of 13 - and rough around the edges.

He is straight-talking, often a man of few words in interviews - some might say a classic Yorkshire trait.

At the Indian Premier League he said he was happy to ""shut up"" local fans who had been ""slagging him off"" and, when standing in as England skipper last year, said ""who cares?""in response to criticism of English dismissals.

Key has said England's players have been guilty of ""talking rubbish"" in the media during their recent poor run. Honesty may be what this struggling England white-ball team needs but Brook must be wary of the scrutiny that comes with leadership.

Before Brook's debut he was described as ""dumb"" by Stokes, something for which the all-rounder later apologised.

His answers may be brief but do not mistake that for a lack of cricket brain.

Brook's 317 against Pakistan last year may take the headlines but one of his best innings was in the drawn 2023 Ashes series at Headingley, when he hit 75 in a chase which had to be managed with the urn on the line.

Brook, like Stokes, is a remarkably hard worker.

He was the chubby kid at Sedbergh, told he would not make a county cricketer because he was not fit enough in the field.

Brook corrected that by running in the Cumbrian fells and last year he used a break, because of the death of his grandmother, to shed pounds and became the leading fielder in the England team.

That is one area in which England's white-ball teams are trailing the best teams in the world.

The sample size is small - five matches against Australia and one season with Northern Superchargers in The Hundred - when it comes to assessing what sort of England captain Brook will be.

Still, do not expect significant change.

""It is very similar to how we want to play in Test cricket. Always looking to put the bowler under pressure and make them change,"" he said during that Australia series, when asked how he wanted the 50-over side to play.

Brook admitted himself he was ""frantic"" at the start of that series but overall, despite England losing 3-2 to the world champions, he largely impressed.

He showed imagination in a win at Chester-le-Street where Cameron Green was caught by a fielder in an unusual position behind the non-striking batter, and bowler Jacob Bethell immediately turned to celebrate in Brook's direction.

Key will also hope captaincy brings the best of Brook the white-ball player.

Brook scored 110 in that win at Durham, which remains his only international white-ball century despite all of his obvious talent.

He was not the only England batter to struggle, but a difficult time in the Champions Trophy and the tour of India that preceded it leaves him with 188 runs across 11 white-ball innings at an average of 17.09 this year.

The biggest negative of appointing Brook is the workload it adds to one of England's busiest players as a Test, 50-over and T20 mainstay.

England's schedule is packed, with 11 Tests, nine one-day internationals and 12 T20s before the end of the Ashes in January.

There is then a T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka to follow in late February and March, where Brook will lead on the global stage for the first time.

For now at least, England's plan is that he will play everything.

There are no direct clashes in fixtures while he is young, does not have children and has had a decent break - having skipped this year's Indian Premier League.

It is not without risk. A burnt-out Brook would hurt England almost as much as an injury to Stokes in Australia.

For Key, though, this one is a gamble worth taking.

"'I'd love team built around him' - who should Man City keep, or sell?",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cy0y5lkw9zko,BBC,Chris Bevan,7/4/2025,"We know Kevin de Bruyne is leaving Manchester City in the summer, but who else might be going - and who should stay?

Their rebuild has already started, with Â£180m spent on four players in January, but a major overhaul of Pep Guardiola's side looks likely at the end of what has been a troubled campaign, with the future of several stars in doubt.

""It feels like there are going to be big changes right through the squad,"" former City goalkeeper Shay Given told BBC Sport.

""City fans must have watched Sunday's Manchester derby and been thinking they have no idea what the future will look like - right now, no-one does.

""They spent a lot in January, and Omar Marmoush has been the stand-out signing from the players they brought in, but the others have struggled a bit.

""Nico Gonzalez and Abdukodir Khusanov are still adjusting to the pace of the Premier League, which shows why this rebuild won't be easy.

""In the past, any City signings under Guardiola have come into a team that was a winning machine, full of confidence and usually top of the league.

""It is a lot easier to join a side that is brimming with confidence and ripping teams apart every week, but Marmoush, Nico, Khusanov and Vitor Reis have joined a different City, with players who look nervous and the team struggling with and without the ball.""

All four of City's midfielders who started Sunday's derby are over 30

City's lack of physicality in midfield has been a key factor in their decline and it is the area of the team that could see the biggest overhaul.

A fit-again Rodri will surely return as the fulcrum of their side when he recovers from his long-term injury, but who will be alongside him is much less certain.

""De Bruyne says he is going, there are doubts over Bernardo Silva and Ilkay Gundogan's future and Jack Grealish has not really had a look in,"" Given explained.

""Bernardo and Gundogan have been such great players and won everything there is to win, but time catches up with everyone - like De Bruyne, they are both in their 30s now.

""It doesn't matter what they have done for City in the past, Guardiola will know he has to freshen things up.""

Bayer Leverkusen's Germany international Florian Wirtz is high on City's list of targets, but Given feels they could have found the answer a lot closer to home.

""There are lots of players who City have let go recently, who they could really do with now,"" he said.

""Cole Palmer is an obvious one but I covered an Aston Villa game the other day and Morgan Rogers would bring all of the things that City need - pace, power and creativity.

""Imagine if he had only been loaned out in 2023, not sold, and there was the possibility of bringing him back in the summer? You would be thinking problem solved, the likes of Gundogan and De Bruyne can go.

""It's not going to be that simple, of course. City sold Rogers to Middlesbrough for about Â£1.5m but think how much he would cost them now?""

Grealish scored City's first goal in Wednesday's 2-0 win over Leicester but was left out of the starting XI at Old Trafford. He replaced Ilkay Gundogan with 16 minutes to go

If there is an overhaul at the Etihad, then it will be with new faces, rather than tactics.

Guardiola is never going to move away from a possession-based playing style and Given feels the old guard can no longer implement an important part of his gameplan.

""A lot of teams City play in the Premier League seem to have more energy, or legs, in the team,"" Given said. ""That's been an issue, because the way they press without the ball is so important to their playing style.

""A big part of their success down the years under Pep was when they won the ball back quickly, high up the pitch, within a few seconds of losing it.

""They would peg teams back and not let them out but now teams are getting through them.

""That needs to be rectified. It's something that will come with fresh legs from the people coming in, but that won't solve all the problems City have, because any new signings have to be the highest quality too.

""With De Bruyne leaving, I would love to see Guardiola build the team around Jack Grealish playing in a central role and dominating games, but it looks like the writing is on the wall for him to go as well.

""For whatever reason, it appears they are not getting on so it does not look good for Jack. He comes in, plays a game or two and then is back out again, no matter how well he does.""

""I'm not just a fan of his, I am his ex-team-mate and friend. It's frustrating to see him being treated this way, because I know he has got so much more to offer the team. He just doesn't get the opportunities, and that is the manager's decision.""

Stones was injured early in City's Champions League defeat by Real Madrid on 19 February and has not played since

City's defensive flaws have not been helped by a series of injuries to their senior centre-halves.

Ruben Dias, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake have all missed chunks of the season - Akanji and Ake are currently sidelined after surgery - while John Stones has been restricted to just six league starts.

Khusanov and Reis, who have only recently turned 21 and 19 respectively, arrived as defensive reinforcements in January but Given would be wary of making sweeping  changes at the back.

""None of the four established centre-halves are near their mid-30s yet,"" Given said. ""Stones is the oldest, and he turns 31 in May, so I still feel they have all got plenty to offer. I'd be reluctant to let any of them go. With Stones, for example, they just have to get him fit.

""If the club considers them all to be injury prone, then that is a problem. But equally you can't just get rid of all that experience, because you need it in that position. A situation next season where Khusanov and Reis are at centre-half would be a bit worrying.""

There is further uncertainty over the futures of Kyle Walker, on loan at AC Milan, and goalkeeper Ederson, who considered a move to Saudi Arabia last year before committing to another campaign at the Etihad.

""The club could get big money for Ederson to fund signings, but then they would have to replace him too,"" Given added.

""There are definitely other positions they should be looking at. Ederson is a brilliant goalkeeper, who is so vital to the way they play out from the back. I don't think there is another keeper in the world who is better with the ball at his feet.

""He is only 31, so he has plenty of years left at the very top level - I was 33 when I joined City, so I would certainly not be rushing him out of the door - they should try to keep hold of him if they can.""

Ederson joined City from Benfica for Â£35m in 2017. He won the Premier League Golden Glove award for most clean sheets in a season for three years running between 2020 and 2022

Whatever City's next step is, they will have a new voice shaping their transfer strategy. Txiki Begiristain is leaving in the summer with Hugo Viana replacing him as director of football.

""I played with Hugo at Newcastle and I am looking forward to meeting him again,"" Given said. ""I am excited to see how he gets on at City but Txiki has left big boots to fill. For a long time City's transfers were brilliant, they hardly put a foot wrong.

""Fixing the squad is part of Hugo's job now but there is a lot of transition going on at the club and there is no guarantee any of it will be smooth.

""We are about to find out what Pep's masterplan is too and it will be fascinating to see how he does next season - he has only known amazing success with Barcelona, Bayern Munich and City and this is the first time in his managerial career that things have not gone his way.

""Can he rebuild City, and come back and win the Premier League again? That is the big question right now, isn't it?""

Cabrera returns to Masters for first time since prison,https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c8rgkddm63ko,BBC,Peter Scrivener,7/4/2025,"Cabrera won the 36-hole James Hardie Pro Football Hall of Fame Invitational by two shots from KJ Choi

Former Masters champion Angel Cabrera is set to compete at Augusta National for the first time in six years following his release from prison.

The Argentine was found guilty in 2021 of numerous charges that included assault, theft and illegal intimidation against former girlfriends.

He was released in August 2023 after serving 30 months in South American prisons.

All Masters champions receive lifetime exemptions to play in the tournament but Cabrera, who also won the 2007 US Open, was unable to take up his playing privilege in 2024 because of visa issues.

Despite the convictions, Masters chairman Fred Ridley, speaking before the 2024 tournament, called Cabrera ""one of our great champions"", adding: ""He has been unable to participate in the Masters the last couple of years due to legal issues.

""We certainly wish him the best of luck with that, and we'll definitely welcome him back if he's able to straighten out those legal issues.""

Cabrera, according to a report inSports Illustrated,,externaldid not touch a golf club for three years but on his release from prison was taken a set by his long-time coach, mentor and friend Charlie Epps.

The 81-year-old Epps said ""golf is all he has left"".

On Sunday the 55-year-old won his first strokeplay title since being freed. He also triumphed in a matchplay event on the Legends Tour in England in June 2024.

""It's emotional after everything that I've gone through,"" said Cabrera after winning the James Hardie Pro Football Hall of Fame Invitational, a PGA Tour-sanctioned seniors event in Florida.

Cabrera, who won a play-off to win the Green Jacket in 2009 and also lost one in 2013 to Adam Scott, last played in the Masters in 2019.

He will also return to the annual Champions Dinner on Tuesday at Augusta National, which sees all past winners gather for a meal whose menu is chosen by the defending champion.

Host Ben Crenshaw - who won the 1984 and 1995 Masters - said: ""I'm excited to see Angel.

""The focus of the dinner will be on Scottie [Scheffler, the reigning champion], but it'll be great to have Angel back.""

Before last year's Masters, Cabrera told Golf Digest: ""It is my dream to return to that prestigious place.

""I played at Augusta for almost 20 years in a row. It is like a second home to me. It would be a great privilege to return and attend the champions dinner with so many of the world's greatest players.""

Cabrera was arrested in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, in January 2021. He had been on Interpol's Red Notice list, a worldwide request for police to arrest an individual, pending extradition.

He had been fugitive in Argentina since the previous August, after he failed to appear at a prosecutor's office following accusations of domestic violence by his partner, Cecilia Torres Mana.

Following his arrest in Brazil, he was remanded in prison until his extradition to Argentina in June 2021.

He was then convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. In November 2022, he was convicted of a second assault and sentenced to an additional two years and four months in prison.

Earlier this year, Cabrera told the Daily Mail: ""Right now, I'm fine, but I regret everything that I have done wrongly in my past, and I am also frustrated that I dumped very, very important years of my life. I made mistakes.""
