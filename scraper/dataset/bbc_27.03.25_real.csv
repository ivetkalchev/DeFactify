"Jeremy Bowen: Zelensky buoyant, but Europe will struggle to guarantee Ukraine's security",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7782kgj8r4o,BBC,Jeremy Bowen,27-03-25,"President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a ""tête à tête dinner"" after the interview.

Macron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.

The French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the ""coalition of the willing"", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.

Zelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to thedressing down he was given by US President Donald Trumpand his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month.

After their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.

It was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration.

He switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.

But even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies.

The evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all.

Most European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States.

American presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.

During the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe – led by the UK, France and Germany – to spend more on defence.

He suggested that in three to five years, ""if everything goes as it is now"", Europe might even catch up with the United States.

At best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.

Europe, Zelensky said, ""has discipline and no chaos"". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.



I asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea.

After Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire.

The most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia.

That decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium.

The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the ""main preconditions"" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was ""the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine"".

Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be ""dragging its feet"" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career.

He told the US cable channel Newsmax that ""I've done it over the years… I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.""



I asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.

""If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land.

""We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone… And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.""

I asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.

""I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.""

Zelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts.

Trump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.

He was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.

""We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.""



That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war.

In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the ""coalition of the willing"" to support Ukraine.

The American said it was a posture and pose, ""a simplistic desire"" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States.

What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.

Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.

""I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives… I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.""

Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.

""He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.""



President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine.

Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.

I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able ""to walk down the street and not have to hide."" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.

""He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.""

Zelensky laughed.

""And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.""

Trump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.

H&M to use digital clones of models in ads and social media,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vwg73xndeo,BBC,Liv McMahon,27-03-25,"Fashion retailer H&M is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to create digital ""twins"" of 30 models.

It says it will use the AI doppelgangers in some social media posts and marketing in the place of humans, if given permission by models.

""We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways – and embrace the benefits of new technology – while staying true to our commitment to personal style,"" said its chief creative officer Jörgen Andersson in a statement.

Despite H&M's claim it would not change its ""human-centric approach"" some fear the move could impact other models, photographers and make-up artists.

American influencer Morgan Riddle called H&M's move ""shameful"" in a post on her Instagram stories.

""RIP to all the other jobs on shoot sets that this will take away,"" she posted.

The Swedish fashion giant, which also operates Arket, Cos, Monki, & Other Stories and Weekday, says it has more than 4,000 stores worldwide across 75 markets.

The initiative was first reported byindustry publication Business of Fashion.

H&M told the outlet that models would retain rights over their digital replicas and their use by the company and other brands for purposes such as marketing.

Its images are likely to be initially used in social media posts, with watermarks that make their AI use clear, it added.

Platforms like Instagram and TikTok require users to disclose the use of AI to create realistic content, and it is labelled as such to inform audiences.

H&M also said models would be compensated for use of their digital twins in a similar way to current arrangements - which sees them paid for use of their images based on rates agreed by their agent.

Paul W Fleming, general secretary of trade union Equity - which represents fashion models in the UK - said models having full control over their likeness and fair pay for its use was ""vital"".

""Whilst we support brands who appear to be moving in this direction, this must be backed up by the widespread adoption of AI protections in union agreements and legislation that protects workers' rights,"" he told the BBC.

Equity, like many other trade unions representing performers and creatives,has been campaigning for better protections for workersamid an explosion of AI-generated content and initiatives online.

""Unfortunately, the current landscape has little to no such protections,"" Mr Fleming added, citing mass, illegal scraping of their model members' work by big tech and AI developers without their consent.

Fashion firms including Hugo Boss and Levi Strauss & Co have also dabbled in using generative AI for product images.

Denim giant Levi'ssaid in 2023it would trial the use of AI-generated model images as a way to ""increase diversity"".

Following criticism, it clarified it would not scale back live photoshoots with models.

Generative AI can create photo-realistic images in response to simple text prompts at high speed and low cost.

Because of this, it has been seized upon by many industries and firms as a way to meet demands for content such as marketing material.

But its use by fashion and beauty brands has sparked backlash amid concerns its increased adoption could reduce job opportunities.

Some fear it may lead to less work for production staff on photoshoots, including photographers, stylists, make-up artists and lighting assistants.

The company says it is working with Swedish tech firm Uncut on the development of the model's AI likenesses.

Uncut says on its website it is ""helping big brands say goodbye to outdated production methods"" and making content creation ""simpler, smarter and more affordable"".

For some models, however, having a so-called ""AI twin"" can allow themto take on more work and avoid travel.

""She's like me, without the jet-lag,"" said model Mathilda Gvarliani in a H&M image shared with Business of Fashion.

Mr Fleming, though, told the BBC that models are still ""being forced to sign unfair contracts which deny them their rights to ownership and fair compensation"".

""This is an abhorrent violation when all of our likenesses are incredibly personal to each of us,"" he added.

'They invited me - now they're attacking me': Signal chat journalist speaks to BBC,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rk7vyg83xo,BBC,Sarah Smith,27-03-25,"When Jeffrey Goldberg published a bombshell story outlining how some of the most senior US officials had mistakenly shared sensitive information with him, he obtained the biggest scoop of the year. The Atlantic editor also became the prime target for every senior Trump administration official in Washington.

In the last couple of days, he's been called a ""loser"" and a ""sleazebag"" by President Donald Trump, as well as a liar and ""scum"" by US National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, who appeared to have mistakenly added Goldberg to a group chat earlier this month.

Before he became a political lightning rod, however, Goldberg watched on his phone as cabinet officials - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, CIA director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - discussed the sensitive details, timings and targets of an upcoming military operation in Yemen. They did not seem to notice his presence.

In an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, he told me it all began when he got a message on his phone, via the publicly available Signal messaging app, which allows users to send each other encrypted messages. It's popular among journalists and government officials. An account under Waltz's name had messaged him, which he assumed was a hoax.

""I wish there was a Le Carré quality here, you know,"" he said, referring to the late British spy novelist. ""But he asked me to talk. I said yes. And next thing I know, I'm in this very strange chat group with the national security leadership of the United States.""



As the fall-out of the episode has engulfed Washington, Waltz has taken responsibility for mistakenly adding Goldberg to the group chat, suggesting that he meant to invite somebody else.

He has insisted that he has never met the editor, saying: ""I wouldn't know him if I bumped into him, if I saw him in a police lineup"".

By Goldberg's account, the two have actually met several times, though he declined to go into detail about their relationship.

""He can say obviously whatever he wants, but I'm not commenting on my relationship or non-relationship,"" Goldberg told me. ""As a reporter, I'm just not comfortable talking publicly about relationships that I may or may not have with people who are news makers.""

Still, one thing is clear: you must already have someone's contact information to reach them on Signal, and so Waltz had Goldberg's phone number. The top security adviser has said he has asked Elon Musk, tech billionaire and the White House's government efficiency czar, to investigate how the mistake happened - a move that was ridiculed by Goldberg.

""Really, you're going to put Elon Musk onto the question of how somebody's phone number ends up in someone's phone? I mean you know, most 8-year-olds could figure it out,"" he said.

The bigger question? ""Should you, as national security officials, be doing this on Signal on your phone?"" Goldberg said.

In his Monday Atlantic story - the first to report his access to the chat - Goldberg withheld the precise details that were shared around the bombing mission that attacked Houthi rebel targets in Yemen on 14 March. But Trump administration officials downplayed the report, calling him a liar and challenging his claims that classified information was shared.

And so two days later, the magazine printed the full text messages, including several from Hegseth that included operational specifics. I asked him if that was a tough decision to make.

""Once Donald Trump said there was nothing to see here, essentially, and once Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe said there was no sensitive information, no classified information, et cetera - we felt like, hm, we disagree,"" he said. ""They're saying that, and we're the ones who have the texts, so maybe people should see them.""

There are text messages in the group chat - sent before the first wave of strikes - detailing exactly when F-18 fighter jets would take off, when the first bombs would drop on Houthi targets and when Tomahawk missiles were going be fired. Hegseth has pushed back, saying they were clearly not ""war plans"" and none of it was classified information.

President Trump expressed his support for Hegseth on Wednesday, saying he was ""doing a great job"" and describing Goldberg as a ""sleazebag"". The White House has also attempted to argue that the information shared was not technically war planning.

Goldberg did not appear swayed by their insults and claims.

""If Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, is texting me, telling me the attack was about to be launched on Yemen - telling me what kind of aircraft are going to be used, what kind of weapons are going to be used, and when the bombs are going to fall two hours after the text is received - that seems sensitive information, war-planning information to me,"" he said.

This isn't the first time that the veteran editor has been on the receiving end of Trump's ire: in 2020 he published a piece in The Atlantic where senior military officials quoted Trump as having referred to fallen American soldiers as ""suckers"" and ""losers"", something the president and his administration have vigorously denied.

I asked him how he felt about the vitriolic personal attacks against him, coming from the very highest levels of the government.

""This is their move. You never defend, just attack,"" Goldberg said. ""So I'm sitting there, minding my own business. They invite me into this Signal chat and now they're attacking me as a sleaze bag, I don't even get it.""



Trump has, so far, been defending his national security team and doesn't seem inclined to sack anyone over what he is calling a press ""witch-hunt"". But Goldberg says there's a widespread feeling in the White House that Waltz made a serious error, as well as deeper concern about how the incident is being handled.

""If you're a Air Force captain, currently working with the CIA and the State Department, and you mishandled sensitive information the way that they've obviously mishandled sensitive information? You'd be fired, you'd be prosecuted,"" Goldberg said.

He said there is now some ""buzz"" among the ranks around the apparently differing accountability standards for leaders in the Trump administration.

Goldberg didn't stick around in the chat for the fallout. He decided the responsible thing to do was to leave the group. Some journalists have expressed incredulity that he would voluntarily exit.

But what happens next will play out in the White House and Congress, where Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans have demanded an investigation.

""There's a part of me that would love to see what else is happening in there. But there's a lot of different issues here related to law and ethics and all kinds of other issues that I really can't go into, "" Goldberg said. ""Believe me when I say that I made that decision with good advice from various parties.""

Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart join Avengers: Doomsday cast,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx208gdj2e0o,BBC,"Helen Bushby, Noor Nanji",27-03-25,"X-Men stars Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart are reprising their roles by joining the cast of Marvel's forthcoming Avengers: Doomsday.

The film is set for release in May 2026, with Robert Downey Jr already announced as playing villain Doctor Doom.

Sir Ian has not appeared as Magneto since 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past. Sir Patrick, meanwhile, last reprised his Professor Charles Xavier role in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in 2022.

Marvel Studios apparently listed the new movie's cast byposting a videoshowing a row of chairs with names on the back.

As well as Sir Ian and Sir Patrick, other names included Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Mackie.

They were joined by Florence Pugh, who plays Yelena Belova, and Simu Liu, who plays Shang-Chi.

There were also chairs for Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Paul Rudd, Wyatt Russell, Tenoch Huerta Mejia, David Harbour and Kelsey Grammer.

Members of this year's upcoming Fantastic Four reboot, including The Last of Us actor Pedro Pascal and The Bear's Ebon Moss-Bachrach, joined them.

Channing Tatum, who appeared as X-Men character Gambit in Deadpool & Wolverine, is also named.

Last summer, Downey Jr was revealedto be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe after five years - but not to the Iron Man role that launched the blockbuster franchise.

At Comic Con in San Diego, Downey Jr appeared on stage concealed behind Doctor Doom's iconic mask and green cloak before unveiling himself to fans.

Speaking to reporters, he said: ""I like playing complicated characters.""

The 59-year-old was instrumental in launching the Marvel movie universe, starring in its first film Iron Man in 2008.

He last appeared in a Marvel film in 2019's Avengers: Endgame.

The US actor won an Oscar for his role in Oppenheimer last year.

"Jeremy Bowen: Zelensky buoyant, but Europe will struggle to guarantee Ukraine's security",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7782kgj8r4o,BBC,Jeremy Bowen,27-03-25,"President Volodymyr Zelensky was in a buoyant mood when I met him in Paris with a panel of three other European journalists. He had interrupted a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace and went back there for what he called a ""tête à tête dinner"" after the interview.

Macron had not just rolled out the red carpet for him. The Eiffel Tower, behind Zelensky in a picture window as we talked in one of Paris's great museums, was lit up in yellow and blue, the colours of the Ukrainian national flag.

The French wanted him to feel as if he was among friends. Zelensky had come to Paris to meet leaders and diplomats from 30 other countries who are working out what they can contribute to the ""coalition of the willing"", the group that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are trying to organise to offer Ukraine security guarantees if there is a long-term ceasefire.

Zelensky's welcome in Paris was a clear contrast to thedressing down he was given by US President Donald Trumpand his vice president JD Vance when he visited the White House last month.

After their verbal attack, Zelensky was unceremoniously turfed out of the White House and not long afterwards Trump ordered the suspension of American military aid and intelligence to Ukraine.

It was restored after Zelensky, advised by the British, the French and other European allies, went out of his way to mend his fences with Trump and his administration.

He switched to the kind of flattering language Trump demands and agreed to an American plan for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire.  He dropped his insistence on US security guarantees first, to underpin any ceasefire.

But even though US military and intelligence assistance is flowing, Trump's ruthless suspension of it, which cost Ukrainian lives, has left a deep sense of unease in Ukraine and among its European allies.

The evidence is piling up that Trump's United States is not a reliable ally. It is getting easier to sketch out scenarios in which it might not be an ally at all.

Most European leaders still try to act publicly as if the 80-year-old alliance with the US is healthy. But the gathering of 30 countries in Paris shows they realise they can no longer rely on the benevolence of the United States.

American presidents going back to Dwight D. Eisenhower in the late 1950s have complained, with good reason, about Europeans getting a free ride from the US security blanket over Europe. Trump has finally pulled it away.

During the interview, Zelensky praised the array of plans that are being formulated in western Europe – led by the UK, France and Germany – to spend more on defence.

He suggested that in three to five years, ""if everything goes as it is now"", Europe might even catch up with the United States.

At best, that is a highly optimistic estimate, less an accurate forecast and more a gesture of appreciation for European allies who unlike the Americans attach very few conditions and strings to support for Ukraine.

Europe, Zelensky said, ""has discipline and no chaos"". That might be seen as an oblique and unflattering comparison with the twists and turns coming out of the Trump White House.



I asked him about the conditions Russia's President Vladimir Putin has attached to the latest small step in the Trump peace initiative, which is a maritime ceasefire in the Black Sea.

After Ukraine and Russia held separate meetings with the Americans in Saudi Arabia, the Kremlin issued a statement that required concessions as Russia's price for a ceasefire.

The most significant demand was for a state-owned Russian bank to be readmitted to the Swift system for international payments. That would open a door back into mainstream global commerce for Russia.

That decision does not depend on Trump, as Swift is based in Belgium.

The European Union foreign affairs spokeswoman responded with a statement saying one of the ""main preconditions"" for lifting or amending sanctions on Russia was ""the end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine"".

Even Trump, reluctant to criticise Putin, suggested that Russia might be ""dragging its feet"" in the negotiations with the US. It reminded him of his own business career.

He told the US cable channel Newsmax that ""I've done it over the years… I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game.""



I asked Zelensky where the push for a ceasefire stood, given Russia's demands. He called for a resolute response from the Americans.

""If America is going to stand strong and not bend to the conditions of the Russians - we stand on our land.

""We are defending it; we have shown our resilience to everyone… And now it's very important that our partners would be resilient and strong, at least at the minimum, as we are.""

I asked whether he believed the Americans would, as he put it, stay strong.

""I hope so. I hope so. God bless they will. But we'll see.""

Zelensky has no choice about stating his faith in Trump's America, even though he must have grave doubts.

Trump's decision to punish Ukraine by cutting off military intelligence about Russia missile launches had an immediate and deadly impact, and Zelensky had to work hard to get Trump to relent. He does not want it to happen again.

He was open about why he had to try to stay close to Trump, even as the US president seemed to be prioritising the restoration of relations with Moscow as he repeated Russian propaganda points, not least the lie that Ukraine started the war.

""We needed to unblock the aid from the US. For us, the exchange of intelligence is very important.""



That did not stop Zelensky rebuking comments made by Steve Witkoff, Trump's super envoy, a real estate billionaire turned diplomat who deals with the Middle East as well as the Russian-Ukraine war.

In an interview last week with Tucker Carlson, a right-wing podcaster in the United States, Witkoff disparaged the drive by the UK's Starmer and France's Macron to create the ""coalition of the willing"" to support Ukraine.

The American said it was a posture and pose, ""a simplistic desire"" to sound like Winston Churchill. His words fit squarely into what seems now to be a settled view in the Trump Administration that their erstwhile allies in Europe are a parasitical burden on the United States.

What if Witkoff was right? Strip away the insults and recognise that Europe's richest nations have chosen, for decades, to spend most of their considerable wealth on matters they consider more pressing than their militaries.

Zelensky said Witkoff and others in the Trump administration, had fallen for Russian propaganda.

""I think that Witkoff often quotes the Kremlin narratives… I can't be ungrateful to the Americans for everything they did, but they are often, unfortunately, under the influence of Russian narratives. And we cannot agree with these narratives.""

Zelensky suggested that Witkoff was better at his old job, developing real estate in Manhattan.

""He doesn't look like a military man. He doesn't look like a general, and he doesn't have such experience. As far as I know, he is very good at selling and buying real estate. And this is a little different.""



President Zelensky, for a man who has lived with immense pressure since Russia's full scale invasion more than three years ago, was remarkably buoyant, clearly pleased by the reception he had in Paris and the efforts that President Macron and Prime Minister Starmer are making to rally European support and to persuade, even cajole,  Trump not to cut intelligence and military support to Ukraine.

Zelensky seemed happy with his new strategy of agreeing to temporary ceasefires to force Putin to show his reluctance to pause the war.

I asked Zelensky how he was dealing with the pressure. His goal, he said, was for his children to be able ""to walk down the street and not have to hide."" And how did he think he'd be remembered; as the man who saved Ukraine, or tried to and failed? Zelensky grimaced slightly. Better, he said, than Putin, who was getting old and feared his own people.

""He will die soon. It is a fact. His reign could end before he finishes his historically insignificant and unsuccessful life. This is what he fears.""

Zelensky laughed.

""And I will do everything I can to defend Ukraine as much as I can. And I am definitely younger than Putin.""

Trump might be hoping for a deal by Easter. Zelensky is still looking to the long haul.

"Germany leads defiance to Trump car tariffs, saying it 'will not give in'",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vjwzv22eo,BBC,Megan Fisher,27-03-25,"Germany has said it ""will not give in"" and that Europe must ""respond firmly"" as US President Donald Trump targets imported cars and car parts with a 25% tax in his latest tariffs.

Other major world economies have vowed to retaliate, with France's president branding the move ""a waste of time"" and ""incoherent"", Canada calling it a ""direct attack"", and China accusing Washington of violating international trade rules.

Carmaker stocks from Japan to Germany dipped. In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%.

Trump has threatened to impose ""far larger"" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as ""economic harm"" to the US.

The fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.

Trump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be ""absolutely no tariff"".

Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.

While the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad.

The firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.

The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (£186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.

Mexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany.

Analysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group.

German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must ""respond firmly"".

""It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,"" he added.

France backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products.

At a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was ""not the time"" for the US to be imposing tariffs.

""Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,"" he said in Paris.

""All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,"" he added, urging Trump to reconsider.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a ""direct attack"" on his country and its car industry, adding it ""will hurt us"", but trade options were being discussed.

In the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was ""not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing"".

Uniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were ""a gift to the Chinese"", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives.

Meanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules.

""There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,"" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said.

There are warnings from Japan that there will be a ""significant impact"" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as ""extremely regrettable"" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption.

In South Korea, a day before the latest levy,Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (£16.3bn) in the USand build a new steel plant in Louisiana.

Trump hailed the investment as a ""clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work"".

Bosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the ""long-term potential"" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there.

The International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a ""significant adverse effect"" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks.

"Six dead and 39 rescued after tourist submarine sinks in Red Sea, says local governor",https://www.bbc.com/news/live/clynd93449kt,BBC,Imogen James,27-03-25,"Imogen JamesLive reporter

At about 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), a tourist submarine sank in the Egyptian Red Sea, off the coast of Hurghada. Our live coverage is ending now, so here's everything we know - and don't know:

What we know:

Six people, all Russian, died after the tourist vessel sank around one kilometre from the coast. The local governor said 39 tourists were rescued, and nobody is missing.

The 45 tourists were from Russia, Norway, Sweden and India, the governor said, along with five Egyptian crew members.

The company in charge, Sindbad, has cancelled upcoming trips and authorities are investigating.

A number of people have got in touch with the BBC to share their experiences on Sindbad submarines -this tourist shared footage from their trip this past weekend.

What we don't know:

We still don't know what caused the sinking.

Speaking to Russian media, a survivor said that as they took their reserved seats, water started ""pouring in"" as two hatches were open. She said it was as if the submarine had fallen off ""whatever it was holding on to"".

(Earlier, we learned that tourists are taken out to the submarine - which is docked at a floating platform - on a regular boat).

But other unconfirmed reports said the vessel hit a reef at 20 metres and lost pressure.

BBC's Mark Lowen deported from Turkey after covering protests,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly34rg5ee5o,BBC,Laura Gozzi,27-03-25,"BBC correspondent Mark Lowen has been deported from Turkey after being arrested in Istanbul on Wednesday, the BBC has said.

Lowen had been in Turkey for several days to report on the ongoing protests that were sparked by the Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu's arrest last week.

Imamoglu - who is being held in jail on corruption charges he denies - is seen as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival.

He has been selected by his party as presidential candidate in the 2028 election.

In a statement issued on Thursday, the BBC said: ""This morning (27 March) the Turkish authorities deported BBC News correspondent Mark Lowen from Istanbul, having taken him from his hotel the previous day and detained him for 17 hours.""

On Thursday morning, he was presented with a written notice that he was being deported for ""being a threat to public order,"" the statement said.

Mark Lowen said: ""To be detained and deported from the country where I previously lived for five years and for which I have such affection has been extremely distressing. Press freedom and impartial reporting are fundamental to any democracy.""

The BBC's CEO of News Deborah Turness added: ""This is an extremely troubling incident and we will be making representations to the Turkish authorities.

""Mark is a very experienced correspondent with a deep knowledge of Turkey and no journalist should face this kind of treatment simply for doing their job. We will continue to report impartially and fairly on events in Turkey.""

Thousands of people across Turkey have turned out for protests which have so far seen more than 1,400 people detained.

The protesters say Imamoglu's arrest is politically motivated, but the justice ministry insists on its judicial independence.

President Erdogan has labelled the demonstrations ""evil"" and blamed the opposition for ""disturbing the peace"".

Several journalists have also been arrested, including a photojournalist from French news agency Agence France Presse and several Turkish reporters. Many were reportedly released on Thursday morning.

Nightly protests have stopped but Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is planning a rally in Istanbul on Saturday.

H&M to use digital clones of models in ads and social media,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vwg73xndeo,BBC,Liv McMahon,27-03-25,"Fashion retailer H&M is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to create digital ""twins"" of 30 models.

It says it will use the AI doppelgangers in some social media posts and marketing in the place of humans, if given permission by models.

""We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways – and embrace the benefits of new technology – while staying true to our commitment to personal style,"" said its chief creative officer Jörgen Andersson in a statement.

Despite H&M's claim it would not change its ""human-centric approach"" some fear the move could impact other models, photographers and make-up artists.

American influencer Morgan Riddle called H&M's move ""shameful"" in a post on her Instagram stories.

""RIP to all the other jobs on shoot sets that this will take away,"" she posted.

The Swedish fashion giant, which also operates Arket, Cos, Monki, & Other Stories and Weekday, says it has more than 4,000 stores worldwide across 75 markets.

The initiative was first reported byindustry publication Business of Fashion.

H&M told the outlet that models would retain rights over their digital replicas and their use by the company and other brands for purposes such as marketing.

Its images are likely to be initially used in social media posts, with watermarks that make their AI use clear, it added.

Platforms like Instagram and TikTok require users to disclose the use of AI to create realistic content, and it is labelled as such to inform audiences.

H&M also said models would be compensated for use of their digital twins in a similar way to current arrangements - which sees them paid for use of their images based on rates agreed by their agent.

Paul W Fleming, general secretary of trade union Equity - which represents fashion models in the UK - said models having full control over their likeness and fair pay for its use was ""vital"".

""Whilst we support brands who appear to be moving in this direction, this must be backed up by the widespread adoption of AI protections in union agreements and legislation that protects workers' rights,"" he told the BBC.

Equity, like many other trade unions representing performers and creatives,has been campaigning for better protections for workersamid an explosion of AI-generated content and initiatives online.

""Unfortunately, the current landscape has little to no such protections,"" Mr Fleming added, citing mass, illegal scraping of their model members' work by big tech and AI developers without their consent.

Fashion firms including Hugo Boss and Levi Strauss & Co have also dabbled in using generative AI for product images.

Denim giant Levi'ssaid in 2023it would trial the use of AI-generated model images as a way to ""increase diversity"".

Following criticism, it clarified it would not scale back live photoshoots with models.

Generative AI can create photo-realistic images in response to simple text prompts at high speed and low cost.

Because of this, it has been seized upon by many industries and firms as a way to meet demands for content such as marketing material.

But its use by fashion and beauty brands has sparked backlash amid concerns its increased adoption could reduce job opportunities.

Some fear it may lead to less work for production staff on photoshoots, including photographers, stylists, make-up artists and lighting assistants.

The company says it is working with Swedish tech firm Uncut on the development of the model's AI likenesses.

Uncut says on its website it is ""helping big brands say goodbye to outdated production methods"" and making content creation ""simpler, smarter and more affordable"".

For some models, however, having a so-called ""AI twin"" can allow themto take on more work and avoid travel.

""She's like me, without the jet-lag,"" said model Mathilda Gvarliani in a H&M image shared with Business of Fashion.

Mr Fleming, though, told the BBC that models are still ""being forced to sign unfair contracts which deny them their rights to ownership and fair compensation"".

""This is an abhorrent violation when all of our likenesses are incredibly personal to each of us,"" he added.

Race to save lives and ancient artefacts in South Korea as wildfires rage,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y214x9lw1o,BBC,Rachel Lee,27-03-25,"Firefighters in South Korea are racing to save lives and ancient artefacts from the largest wildfire in the country's history.

At least 27 people have been killed so far, according to the country's interior ministry - making the blaze also South Korea's deadliest. A further 32 people have been injured, some seriously.

Most of those killed were in their 60s and 70s, local officials say.

It is thought the wildfires, which first broke out in south-eastern Sancheong county nearly a week ago, were started accidentally by local human activities.

Fuelled by strong and dry winds, the fires have spread to several neighbouring counties, including Uiseong - where the largest of all the blazes currently is.

The authorities believe this fire broke out while visitors were tending to a family grave in the hills. Video footage from the gravesite shows a lighter on the ground.

Other fires are presumed to have been started from a welding spark, or burning of rubbish.

The fires have burned though more than 35,810 hectares (88,500 acres) so far - about half the size of New York City. As they continue to spread, artefacts including wooden printing blocks and paintings, have been moved from major temples.

The authorities are keeping a close eye on potential damage to two Unesco-listed sites: Hahoe Village and Byeongsan Seowon in Andong City.

The fires have already destroyed the Gounsa temple, which was built in 618 AD and was one of the largest temples in the province.

A Buddhist architectural structure deemed a national treasure from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) was also destroyed, forestry authorities confirmed.

Tens of thousands of people have so far been ordered to evacuate because of the fires.

Kwon Young-chang, 35, told the BBC that the smoke filled his neighbourhood in Andong, forcing him to head north to Yecheon.

""The damage in Andong is devastating, and our neighbours, who have suffered great losses, are in deep despair,"" he said.

Mr Kwon said the official information he had received had been confusing, and that he had been getting updates from local authorities' social media pages. He feared that older people would not have access to these.

Another Andong resident, who asked not to be named, told BBC Korean that her house, which her family had lived in for more than 30 years, was ""completely burnt down"" within just a few hours.

""There's nothing left. You can't even tell where the house used to be,"" she said. ""It's difficult to see the village like this.""

Jang Jung-suk, who lives in Cheongsong County, says her beekeeping site was completely destroyed by the fire.

""We saw really strong winds the day the fire spread to our village. It was hard to even stand still,"" Jang said.

After briefly evacuating, she and her husband returned to find their home damaged and their business, which they had been building for five years and were just starting to reach a point of stability with, gone. Jang says her husband couldn't hold back tears when he saw the damage.

""I'm at a loss. I need to figure out how to start over,"" she said.

While the weather rarely causes wildfires on its own, it can give conditions that help wildfires to take hold and spread.

This is exactly what has happened in South Korea. Temperatures several degrees above the seasonal norm have combined with dry ground, strong winds and low humidity to fuel fires that authorities say were ignited by human activity.

Lee Han-gyeong, the government official in charge of emergency response, said ""we are witnessing the reality of climate crisis like never before"".

"One million children could die if US cuts funding, charity warns",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyd505vzlwo,BBC,Dorcas Wangira,27-03-25,"A global health organisation has warned that one million children could die from preventable diseases if the US terminates its financial support.

Dr Sania Nishtar - head of Gavi, an alliance that buys critical vaccines for developing countries - told the BBC a cut in US funding would have a ""disastrous impact on global health security"".

This followsa report in the New York Timesthat the Trump administration intends to terminate Gavi's funding - the US is the alliance's third largest donor.

Gavi has not received a termination notice from the US but it was ""engaging with the White House and Congress"" to secure $300m (£230m) for its activities in 2025, and longer-term funding, Dr Nishtar said.

The US has pledged $1.6bn for the 2026-2030 period - about 15% of Gavi's total funding.

Since taking office in January 2025, US President Donald Trump has made it clear he wants overseas spending to be closely aligned with his ""America First"" approach.

The international development sector has been braced for a profound effect on humanitarian programmes around the world.

TheUS Agency for International Development (USAID)was one of the first agencies targeted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) for cuts at the start of 2025, when the Trump administration ordered a 90-day freeze of all US foreign aid.

Of the 500 million children that need to be immunised around the world, 75 million would miss out if Gavi lost US funding, said Dr Nishtar, resulting in deaths from preventable diseases like measles, tuberculosis, pneumonia and polio.

This would also mean that governments and health agencies' ability to keep the world safe through vaccine stockpiles against diseases such as Ebola, cholera and mpox would be compromised, she said.

Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) agrees with Gavi's warning about the potential funding cuts.

""The consequences of this political decision will be catastrophic,"" said MSF USA chief programs officer Carrie Teicher.

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) ""fully supports"" Gavi and is ""engaging"" with US authorities on the disruption caused by the withdrawal of US funding for major programmes, said Africa CDC emergencies incident manager Dr Ngongo Ngashi.

He added: ""We are prioritising routine vaccines but we also know how crucial vaccines for emergencies are.""

Dr Ngashi also said it was ""critical that we find our own funding streams - that are not dependent on the decision of partners"" and which help Africans contribute ""to advancing public health"".

Gavi has said it will try to further broaden its donor base. Indonesia, a country that has previously been a recipient of Gavi's assistance, became a donor last year.

""As a lean and efficient organisation where 97 cents in every dollar raised goes towards our immunisation programmes, it is impossible to consider that any cut in funding by the US would not have disastrous implications for global health and for the safety of people everywhere,"" Dr Sania Nishtar said.

The BBC has contacted the US State Department, which runs what remains of USAID, for comment.

'I have terminal cancer and lost my life savings to whisky barrel scammers',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2r7enl3d1o,BBC,Carla Basu,27-03-25,"Victims have been conned out of millions of pounds in a whisky barrel investment scam, a BBC investigation has found.

Hundreds of people were duped into ploughing their life savings and pensions into casks that were overpriced or did not exist, while some individual casks were sold multiple times to different investors.

The victims include one woman with terminal cancer who invested £76,000 and another woman who spent more than £100,000 on casks which experts say were only ever worth a fraction of the price they paid.

The BBC can reveal that police are investigating three Scotch whisky companies over fraud allegations, with investments running into the millions.

The market's popularity has grown rapidly in recent years because of the reports of huge returns being made from rare whiskies.

Investors buy a cask of whisky when it is first produced and then hope that it rises in value as the spirit ages in the barrel.

It takes three years for spirit to become Scotch whisky in a cask, and investors are encouraged to keep barrels for up to 10 years or more to maximise returns.

There are many legitimate traders – but a lack of regulation has enabled fraudsters to exploit the market. They use misleading claims and even outright fabrications to lure in unsuspecting investors.

There is no central authority regulating or tracking the ownership of casks, making it difficult to verify claims.

As a result, many investors find themselves entangled in complex legal disputes or left with assets worth far less than they were led to believe.

Alison Cocks, from Montrose, invested £103,000 in a company called Cask Whisky Ltd, run by a man calling himself Craig Arch.

She initially bought a single whisky cask for £3,000, and at first everything appeared legitimate.

Mrs Cocks was given certificates, and the company provided an online portal where she could track her investment. Her portfolio appeared to grow, on paper at least.

Comforted by the projected returns she was being promised, which started at 12% and were forecast to increase to as much as 50% over time, she was convinced to invest more.

She bought another three casks for a total of £100,000.

However, she said that the problems started when she told the company she wanted to sell.

""Suddenly they didn't want to talk to me anymore. They were avoiding my calls. I was really panicking,"" she said.

""I decided I would start investigating my own casks.

""On my certificates, it showed where my casks were, allegedly. When I actually contacted those warehouses, they weren't there.""

Mrs Cocks was told by independent whisky valuers that she paid five times what her barrels were actually worth.

She has since been able to track down three of the four casks in warehouses, but none is in her name. One has also been bought by someone else.

The most expensive cask she bought – which cost her £49,500 – does not exist.

Alison Cocks is one of 200 people who invested with Cask Whisky Ltd and are trying to work out if they actually own their casks.

The BBC has discovered that Craig Arch – the company's CEO – is actually Craig Brooks, a disqualified director and convicted fraudster.

In 2019, Brooks and his brother were jailed for a £6.2m fraud, where 350 victims were cold called and convinced to invest in carbon credits and ""rare earth metals"".

The City of London Police Serious and Organised Crime team is now investigating Brooks' whisky company.

But the BBC can also reveal that Brooks is running another cask whisky company, Cask Spirits Global Ltd, under another false name, Craig Hutchins.

As a disqualified director, it is illegal to run or control a company.

Yet, using the name Hutchins, Brooks told an undercover BBC reporter that he was in charge of ""decision making"" and that he dealt with finances.

When confronted, Brooks admitted his name was not Hutchins, but maintained all of the whisky casks he sold existed. He said he never told the reporter he made the company decisions.

Another company, called Whisky Scotland, has also left a trail of dissatisfied investors.

They include NHS worker Jay Evans, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2021. She put her home in Brighton on the market so she could make investments to provide long-term security for her loved ones.

She invested almost £76,000 in Whisky Scotland after being promised lucrative returns from a company director.

Mrs Evans, 54, sold her home and moved to Peacehaven in East Sussex, then used the money from the sale to invest in seven casks.

The company's director sent her voicemails from across the world, telling her she was his ""favourite ever client"" and that he would ""always look after her"".

But two of the casks did not exist, and the other five had been sold at a much higher cost than their true worth.

Mrs Evans has been told it would take 25 years to recoup what she has paid.

The company and directors have now vanished. Its Glasgow office is just a rented space and a BBC reporter was told they were never there.

""They've made somebody who's facing end of life at an early age, they've made it infinitely more difficult. None of it will matter to people like this,"" Mrs Evans said.

Her wife Susie Walker said it was ""heart-breaking"" that the money Jay had worked for had gone overnight, and that she would now need to carry on working.

Self-employed locksmith Geoff Owens, from Wrexham, invested his life savings - more than £100,000 - with Whisky Scotland.

He and other investors are now trying to track down their casks and their investments.

Mr Owens says he will not stop until he finds out what has happened to his money.

""No-one is going to rip me off and walk away from this, without me facing you,"" he said.

""I will get an army together who you've ripped off, and we will try and do something about it.""

The BBC asked the directors of Whisky Scotland for a comment. They did not respond.

Martin Armstrong runs Whisky Broker, a bonded warehouse in Creetown, near Dumfries, which stores 48,000 casks.

He says he is being contacted ""almost every day"" by investors looking for casks sold by unscrupulous companies.

Asked if he thought that fraud could ever be so rife in the sector, he said: ""No. But I knew it was possible.

""When there's money involved, then everything follows.""

Kenny Macdonald - a legitimate whisky cask broker who runs his own company, Dram Mor – said there were other ""good guys"" operating in the industry.

He said there were ""a huge amount of people"" who were ""profiteering"" - but that in those cases, investors were at least getting a product.

""And then you get the ones who are downright nasty. And they're selling somebody a piece of paper, for a cask that just never existed.

""The sharks are circling. They know there's blood. They can smell it.

""And unfortunately, in this particular case, the blood is whisky.""

Macron urges Algeria to free writer jailed for Morocco comments,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rk71lxv11o,BBC,Natasha Booty,27-03-25,"France's President Emmanuel Macron is urging Algeria to free an 80-year-old writer who was sentenced on Tuesday to five years in prison, following accusations he had undermined Algeria's territorial integrity.

Boualem Sansal was arrested in Algeria last year after apparently telling a French far-right media group that, during the colonial era, France gave too much land to Algeria and too little to Morocco.

He had also said that the disputed territory of Western Sahara was historically part of Morocco.

During his detention the French-Algerian author has spent time in hospital for ill-health.

His case has sparked a wave of support from intellectuals and politicians, including Nigerian Nobel Prize-winning author Wole Soyinka, Indian-British novelist Salman Rushdie and French officials.

One conservative mayor of a Parisian suburbis promising to hand out free copies of Sansal's books to every 18-year-old in his town, and says the author's sentencing in Algeria is an attack on free speech.

The French president meanwhile told a news conference: ""I hope there can be humanitarian decisions by the highest Algerian authorities to give him back his freedom and allow him to be treated for the disease he is fighting.""

Back in February, Macron sent a stark warning about the writer's plight, saying ""Boualem Sansal's arbitrary detention, on top of his worrying health situation, is one of the elements that need to be settled before confidence [between our countries] can be fully restored.""

Boualem Sansal now finds himself at centre of a deepening diplomatic row.

""He has unwillingly become a pawn in the troubled relationship between Paris and Algiers,"" a committee of his supporters in France said recently.

Algeria was once a prized French colony and fought a dogged war of independence eventually winning its sovereignty in 1962.

Relations have long been strained between the two countries but reached a new low last year, when France backed Morocco's claim to Western Sahara, where Algeria backs the Polisario group fighting for the territory's independence.

Algiers responded to that slight by withdrawing its ambassador to Paris.

Three years earlier, Algeria severed diplomatic ties with Morocco.

Following Wednesday's court ruling, Sansal's lawyer pleaded to Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune to show ""humanity"" to the writer.

Sansal is well known for his anti-Islamist views and is an outspoken critic of the Algerian government.

His detractors say he is a darling of the far-right who appeases their prejudices.

Far-right French leader Marine Le Pen has called Sansal a ""fighter for liberty and a courageous opponent of Islamism"".

His age has previously been reported as 75, but his publishers Gallimard say he is in fact 80.

Sansal's best-known works include 2084 - a satire about religious radicalism which won the French Academy's Grand Prix of the Francophonie a decade ago.

His next novel, Vivre, is to be published in May and tells the story of a select group of people who are chosen to colonise a new planet as Earth nears apocalypse.

Babysitter finds man under bed after child complains of 'monster',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70e2y98p06o,BBC,Mallory Moench,27-03-25,"A babysitter found a man hiding under a child's bed in Kansas after the child complained about a ""monster"" being there.

While trying to show the child there was nothing under the bed, the female victim ""came face-to-face"" with a male suspect, Barton County Sheriff's Office said. An altercation ensued with the babysitter and one child was knocked over.

The suspect fled and was found and arrested on the same block the next morning, on Tuesday, after leading deputies on a short foot chase.

The 27-year-old, who once lived at the residence and had a protection from abuse order to stay away from the property, was booked into jail on requested charges of aggravated kidnapping, among other crimes.

Other charges requested include aggravated burglary, aggravated battery, child endangerment, felony obstruction of a law enforcement officer and violation of a protection from abuse order.

Law enforcement was dispatched to the location just outside the city of Great Bend around 22:30 local time on Monday (03:30 on Tuesday GMT), where the babysitter told deputies she had been putting the children to bed when one complained about a ""monster"".

The suspect is being held in county jail on a $500,000 (£386,016) bond.

Egypt submarine sinking: What we know so far,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kj9rzmdp9o,BBC,Alex Boyd,27-03-25,"Six people have died after a tourist submarine sank in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt, a local governor has said.

Among 39 others who were rescued, nine were said to have been injured, while four are in critical condition after the incident early on Thursday morning near the city of Hurghada.

In total, 45 passengers were thought to have been on-board the submarine, called Sindbad, when it sank close to the harbour.

Here's what we know so far.

The Red Sea area governor, Amr Hanafy, said six tourists died and 39 further people were rescued after the submarine sank. No people are missing.

He said the 45 passengers on board were from Russia, India, Norway and Sweden. There were also five Egyptians on board.

All of those who died were from Russia. A Russian official in Hurghada, Viktor Voropaev, said that two of those killed were children.

An earlier statement from the Russian embassy in Egypt had said all of the tourists on board were Russian.

The submarine, Sindbad, had been in operation as a tourist submarine for a number of years.

According to the company running the tourist trips - Sindbad Submarines - its vessels take passengers on journeys to explore coral reefs near the Hurghada coastline.

The company says it holds two of the only ""14 real recreational submarines"" in the world, which hold 44 seats for passengers and two seats for pilots.

Tours are designed for both adults and children, the company's website says, and allow passengers to travel 25 metres (82 feet) underwater.

Dr James Aldridge, who took the same trip on one of the company's submarines last month, said each passenger is given ""a seat on a cushion next to your window and there is a recorded safety brief in multiple languages"".

The vessel ""wasn't cramped or overcrowded"", Dr Aldridge, from Bristol, said, adding that he ""never felt unsafe"".

""The sub departed and we toured the reef for 40 minutes,"" he said. ""For the first 20 I was facing the reef, the sub never strayed 'too close'.""

According to Dr Aldridge, the divers accompanying the submarine ""used fish food to attract the wildlife"" to keep the passengers entertained.

Dr Aldridge said the submarine ""never went close"" to a 25 metre depth.

He was not, however, issued a life jacket.

Benjamin Grey, 50, from Camberley, also took a trip on a Sindbad submarine in February - but had quite a different experience.

He boarded with his 13-year-old daughter and his partner, and said he noticed ""problems"" during the trip, including the submarine surfacing ""at least three times"".

""About halfway through there was a diver who looked like he'd picked up a rock,"" he said. ""He was banging something on the bottom of the submarine. Clearly at some point the submarine had stopped moving and the divers outside were doing something.""

He also said - in contrast to Dr Aldridge - that ""no safety procedures were talked through"".

The submarine sank off the coast of the Egyptian Red Sea city of Hurghada, the BBC understands.

It is believed the incident took place in the harbour. The Russian embassy said it happened around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), around 0.6 miles (1km) from the shore.

Hurghada is a popular tourist destination, with its coastline known for its beaches and coral reefs. A number of tourist trip companies operate out of its harbour.

In recent years, there have been other incidents involving Red Sea tourist boats operating out of the city.

In November, a tourist boat called the Sea Story sank, leaving 11 dead or missing - including a British couple - and 35 survivors. The BBC later heardaccusations of safety failings on board.

UK investigators said last monththere had been 16 incidents involving ""liveaboard"" vessels in the area in the last five years, with a number resulting in deaths.

Authorities in Egypt are investigating the cause of the incident, and details are currently unclear.

There continues to be a lot of activity from other boats around the harbour near where the submarine sank.

Red Sea governor Amr Hanafy said the submarine had a valid licence and the crew leader had the correct ""scientific certificates"".

It appeared that the weather was quite calm with no sign of any rough waters.

China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8vp2e7p64o,BBC,Nick Marsh,26-03-25,"On a hot, humid Thursday night in Saitama, China's national football team hit its lowest ebb.

With a minute left on the clock and trailing Japan 6-0, Chinese defenders were likely wishing for the sweet relief of the final whistle.

But Japan's Takefusa Kubo was not feeling charitable. After watching his team-mates toy with their opponents for a while, he received a pass on the edge of the Chinese box and rammed home Japan's seventh goal.

The ball rocketed into the roof of the net, and the man known as ""Japanese Messi"" condemned China to their worst-ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier.

The 7-0 spanking in September - described as ""rock-bottom"" by a Shanghai-based newspaper – followed a year-long line of humiliating defeats which included losses to Oman, Uzbekistan and Hong Kong.

But worse was to come.

A week later dozens of players, coaches and administrators were arrested for gambling, match-fixing and bribery as part of a two-year probe into corruption in the domestic game.

And the defeats have continued. On Tuesday, Australia beat China 2-0 in Hangzhou - cementing them at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group.

It wasn't long ago that China had dreamed of becoming a footballing superpower.

The world's largest population, a thriving economy and a determined Communist Party led by an avid football fan, President Xi Jinping. What could go wrong?

Apparently, quite a lot.

When Xi came to power in 2012, his love for the sport spurred a drive to reform and improve Chinese football. His dream, he once said, was for China to qualify for the World Cup, host it and, ultimately, win it. These were his ""three wishes"".

But a decade later, even Xi seemed to have lost the faith. While making small talk with Thailand's prime minister on the sidelines of an international summit in 2023, the Chinese president was heard saying that China had ""got lucky"" in a recent victory against Thailand.

""When China's government puts its mind to something, it very rarely fails,"" says Mark Dreyer, a Beijing-based sports writer. ""Look at electric vehicles, look at the Olympics. Practically any sector you can think of, China is right up there.""

But football, it seems, could not thrive in the grip of the Communist Party.

A key government report in 2015 noted that The Chinese Football Association (CFA) must have ""legal autonomy,"" and should be ""independent"" of the General Administration of Sport (GAS).

Even Xi admitted that if China wanted to succeed, then the Party would have to do what it seldom does: let go.

And yet, Beijing didn't let go.

""China's failure in football has become a national embarrassment and figuring out the reasons has become a national obsession,"" Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts: One Man's Quest to Teach the People's Republic of China to Love Football, told the BBC.

""But to me, the reasons are pretty clear and they tell you a lot about how the country is run.""

The problem, he and others argue, is that China's one-party state imposes decisions from the top. While this is effective for economic growth, it yields poor results in competitive team sports.

Although Fifa prohibits state interference, Chinese football is rife with political appointments. This is common in China, where the Party controls most aspects of public life.

The current president of the CFA, Song Cai, is also a Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party. His work, in turn, is overseen by a senior government official at the GAS.

""Everything has to report upwards to Communist Party bosses. It basically means that non-football people are making football decisions,"" Mr Dreyer says. ""Football has to be grassroots-led. You start at the bottom of the pyramid and the talent starts to funnel up to the top.""

All major footballing nations have a ""pyramid"" of leagues. The elite professional clubs sit at the top, supported by a deep pool of semi-professional and amateur teams, all of whose players are vying to work their way up.

Such a pyramid thrives on a culture of playing football, en masse, for fun. The larger the pool to draw from, the better the players at the top will be.

""If you look at every country where football is really successful, the sport has grown organically as a grassroots activity over the past 100 years,"" Mr Simons says. ""Professional football in China has continually failed because it's supported by nothing - their pyramid is upside down.""

The statistics bear this out: England's 1.3 million registered players dwarf China's fewer-than-100,000 footballers. This is in spite of China's population being 20 times larger than England's.

""Kids here don't grow up with a ball at their feet. Without that, you're not going to produce elite talent,"" Mr Dreyer says.

Top-level football in Europe and South America traces its origins to streets and parks in every town and village. In China, however, the push began in Beijing.

It wasn't until the 1990s that the government set up the country's first professional league. It created a handful of top clubs in major cities - but neglected the grassroots.

Keen to impress their bosses, officials in this top-down system inevitably opt for a ""short-termist"" approach that sacrifices genuine improvement over time for quick fixes, Mr Dreyer explains.

Some foreigners who have played in China say such a heavily controlled system also leaves little room for young players to develop a natural understanding of the game.

A European currently playing in China, who did not wish to reveal his name, told the BBC that while many Chinese players are ""technically good"", they lack ""football IQ"" at crucial moments on the pitch.

""Creativity and basic decision-making, which we learn instinctively as a kid, you don't see so much here,"" the player says.

This does not mean that there is not a deep love for football in China.

While the men's team, currently ranked 90th in the world, is seen as a constant disappointment, the women's team, ranked 17th, has been a source of pride for years.

Many in China have referred to them as the ""real"" guozu or national team - and in 2023, a record 53 million people tuned in to watch them play - and lose 6-1 - to England at the World Cup.

The men's Super League boasts the highest average attendance of any league in Asia. At its peak in the 2010s, it was attracting big-name foreign players as it rode a wave of investment from state-owned enterprises, buoyed by a thriving economy.

But it was short-lived.

Since the pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown in China, more than 40 professional clubs have folded as state-backed companies started to pull their investments. Private companies, too, have proved fickle in their commitment.

In 2015, the Suning Appliance Group, which also used to own the top Italian club Inter Milan, bought Jiangsu FC. The club went on to win the Super League in 2020. But months later, Suning said they were closing the club to focus on their retail business.

The demise of Guangzhou Evergrande, China's most successful team ever, is yet another example.

Bankrolled by property giant Evergrande Group, they won trophy after trophy under the management of Italian greats such as Marcello Lippi and Fabio Cannavaro. But as they found glory at home and in Asia, their parent company was overstretching itself in an inflated property market.

Evergrande is now the world's most indebted property company and the poster-child for China's real estate crisis, with arrears of more than $300bn (£225bn).

Its former club - now in the hands of new owners - wasexpelled from the league in January. After years of splurging, the eight-time champions are still struggling to pay off their debt.

But that is not the only crisis engulfing Chinese football. Its rapid rise created another problem: corruption.

""I should have followed the right path. I was just doing what was customary at the time,"" says Li Tie, the former manager of China's national men's team, in a 2024 documentary.

In that documentary, Li makes a shocking admission: for years he fixed matches and paid bribes to get certain jobs, including 3m yuan (£331,000, $418,500) to become the national team coach in 2019.

Dressed in all-black, he marks a written confession with an inky fingerprint: ""I'm very sorry.""

China's national team was made to watch the documentary by state broadcaster CCTV while preparing for last year's Asian Cup in Qatar.

The primetime expose, co-produced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), was the first episode of a four-part series on corruption in China called Continued Efforts, Deepening Progress.

In it, dozens of Chinese officials confess - always to camera - to staggering levels of corruption across a variety of industries.

By airing the football episode first, the authorities signalled their serious concern about graft within the sport.

Li, who appeared in a World Cup and once played for Premier League side Everton, is the most high-profile figure to have been apprehended last year in an unprecedented slew of anti-corruption arrests in Chinese football.

In December, he wassentenced to 20 years in jail.

Also publicly shamed in the documentary are former CFA chairman Chen Xuyuan and ex-deputy director of the GAS, Du Zhaocai.

""The corruption of these officials has broken our hearts,"" one fan told CCTV. ""I'm not surprised,"" said another.

The documentary echoed what one ex-national team player told a BBC radio documentary in 2015 in an anonymous interview: that there was a system of ""open bidding"" among players for their spot in the squad.

""I could have won many more caps, but I didn't have the cash,"" he said.

It would take another 10 years before corruption in football exploded into the spotlight. Some suggest this was prompted by China's intolerably bad performances on the pitch.

The struggles of China's men's football team are all the more stark given how other sports are flourishing in the country.

Decades of investment in infrastructure and training have taken China from a sporting backwater to a medal-winning machine that recently equalled the United States with 40 golds at the Paris Olympics.

But many of these are individual sports - weightlifting, swimming, diving -  which require fewer resources and, crucially, less emphasis on community-led grassroots efforts, compared to a game like football.

They are also less lucrative and, therefore, less vulnerable to corruption and mismanagement.

As China's economy reels from a sustained downturn, its officials have bigger challenges than football woes.

But that is little consolation to fans.

The loss to Japan particularly stung. While Japan have gone from strength to strength over the past two decades, China have failed to qualify for a single World Cup.

The day after the loss, the Oriental Sports Daily did not mince its words: ""When the taste of bitterness reaches its extreme, all that is left is numbness.""

According to Mr Dreyer, Japan's approach is antithetical to China's: a long-term vision, a lack of political interference and a commercially savvy club structure.

""Even so, the fan culture here [in China] is still remarkably good,"" he adds. ""They deserve so much more.""

Their disappointment showed following Tuesday's defeat against Australia - but so did their humour.

""It seems like the national team's performance is as consistent as ever,"" wrote one fan on social media. Another joked that if China wants to continue thriving economically, then its football team must suffer so there is a balance in ""national fortune"".

Perhaps they had resigned themselves to what a popular Chinese journalist had written in his blog after Japan beat China.

Football ""cannot be boosted by singing odes or telling stories"", he noted. ""It needs skill, and physical and tactical training. It cannot be accomplished through politics.""

Four lingering questions about Trump officials' Signal chat,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y41xdrxnyo,BBC,Kayla Epstein,27-03-25,"For the past 48 hours, top White House officials have faced questions from lawmakers and the press about how a journalist came to join a sensitive group chat for an upcoming military operation - and why President Donald Trump's national security team was sharing sensitive information in an unsecure manner.

The Atlantic first reporteddetails of the group chat on the platform Signalafter its editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was added to it. He followed the thread as top Trump administration officials discussed upcoming military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

The Atlantic then on Wednesday published the entire text thread that showed the detailed and potentially classified rundown for a March air raids.

While the thread appears to have contained sensitive information, there is still much that remains unknown. Here are four lingering questions regarding so-called ""Signal-gate"".

The Trump administration maintains the information shared in the chat was not classified.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that ""no war plans"" were discussed on the chat. Instead, she characterised the information shared as  ""sensitive policy discussions"".

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers during a congressional hearing that the Signal chat was ""candid and sensitive"", though ""no classified information was shared"".

But under questioning, she and CIA Director John Ratcliffe appeared uncertain about the classification of the attack plan. They later emphasised that Hegseth had the power to classify and declassify the type of details that were shared.

Hegseth has denied sharing classified material, but experts are sceptical that this type of sensitive information would not carry that kind of designation.

Jamil Jaffer, executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University, said that Hegseth did not send ""an operational plan for World War Three, or for the Pacific region"".

""But at the same time,"" Mr Jaffer said, ""these are operational details that could, if released publicly, put American lives at risk or jeopardise the success of the operation.""

In his original article, Mr Goldberg reports that on 11 March he initially ""received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz"", Trump's national security adviser.

Two days later, he writes that he received a notice that he was to be included in a Signal group titled the ""Houthi PC small group.""

Mr Goldberg reports that the group received a message from Waltz, which also noted one of his deputies was ""pulling together"" a team of top staffers relevant to the discussion.

On Tuesday, Trump suggested that a ""lower level"" staffer for Waltz added Mr Goldberg to the chat.

However, Waltz himself told Fox News' Laura Ingraham: ""I take full responsibility. I built the - I built the group.""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was also in the group, said on Wednesday that someone had made a ""mistake"" in adding Mr Goldberg.

It remains to be seen whether the Republican-controlled Congress will launch oversight investigations.

Republican lawmakers have emphatically supported the Trump administration's agenda to this point, so it seems improbable that they would support investigations into the Signal chat.

Democrats in the House are reportedly trying to force a vote on a ""Resolution of Inquiry"" that would require the Trump administration to hand over records related to the incident, according to Reuters, but they do not have a majority.

While some Republicans have raised concerns over the leak, few have appeared eager to cross the president.

The use of Signal to discuss the Houthi strikes posed broader questions about how Trump's top staffers are sharing and discussing sensitive information.

Gabbard testified on Wednesday that Signal came ""pre-installed on government devices"".

She cited guidance from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which mentioned Signal as an example of a messaging service with end-to-end encryption.

Ratcliffe earlier testified to Congress that Signal had been installed on his devices when he took over the CIA.

But it remains uncertain if security officials had provided guidance about using Signal for discussing military operations like the strikes against the Houthis.

""Whether these circumstances were approved or not is still not clear,"" Mr Jaffer said.

CBS News, the BBC's US partner, has reported that the US National Security Agency had warned employees against using Signal due to ""a vulnerability"" that they had identified.

Atomfall: How a forgotten nuclear disaster inspired a video game,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4n5127dxo,BBC,"Peter Gillibrand, Tom Richardson",27-03-25,"Fukushima. Three Mile Island. Chernobyl. Places that will forever be remembered as the sites of nuclear disasters.

Most people will have heard of them. But fewer are aware of the Windscale fire.

It was one of the world's first - and remains the UK's worst - nuclear accident.

A nuclear reactor at the site in Cumbria caught fire on 10 October 1957 and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.

Many details of the event were kept quiet for decades, and it is far less famous than some of the more recent examples.

But a new video game has brought the disaster, and the area where it happened, back into the spotlight.

Atomfall is the latest release from Oxford-based Rebellion, best known for its long-running Sniper Elite series.

CEO Jason Kingsley tells BBC Newsbeat he was walking in the Lake District when the idea of using the real-life Windscale story ""as a trigger point for a fictionalised version of the disaster"" began to take shape.

Atomfall is a survival action game set in the rolling green landscapes of the beauty spot, but on an alternative sci-fi inspired timeline where the area surrounding the plant has become a quarantine zone.

""It went pretty wrong in real life, but it was controlled,"" says Jason.

""It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants or mutants or dangerous cults to emerge.""

Although the Windscale fire was ""very serious"", Jason says it's not something that is especially well-remembered, even among locals.

It was previouslyestimated about 240 casesof thyroid cancer were caused by the radioactive leak, but morerecent researchhas suggested this was unlikely.

Scientists suggested a decision to destroy all milk produced within 310 square miles (800 square km) of the site for a month after the fire helped to prevent exposure.

Windscale was eventually renamed Sellafield and produced nuclear power until 2003. It still employs about 10,000 people in the local area.

When Newsbeat visits Cumbria, most young people we speak to say they haven't heard of the disaster.

And indie game developers Hannah Roberts and Harry Hawson say that they became more aware of it once the game was announced.

For two people like them, who hope to break into the games industry, they're excited to see a game set in the place where they live.

Hannah, 26, says it's evident Atomfall's makers have done their research.

""The actual environments are spot on, they've got fantastic Morris dancing stuff going on - it really tickled me when I saw that,"" she says.

Hannah says other small details - like black and white Cumbrian signposts - were also pleasing to see.

Atomfall's setting and its inspiration have made it an anticipated title since it was first revealed last year, and Harry, 23, says that's been encouraging for him.

""Seeing that such a small space like Cumbria can be taken by the games industry and built upon and people are receptive to that, it's exciting for the future and I look forward to seeing what's next for me,"" he says.

It's fairly unusual for high-profile games set in the UK to be set outside London.

While indie games - such as the Shropshire-set Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and last year's Barnsley-based laughfest Thank Goodness You're Here! - have ventured further north, bigger games haven't tended to stray beyond the M25.

Jason says the US is about 40% of the video games market, so it's important to appeal to players there, and there's a ""natural tendency"" to follow the norms.

Being an independent company, he feels, allows Rebellion to do things differently, and Britain offers lots of inspiration for new settings - if you're prepared to look for them.

""The UK, I think, to understand certain aspects of our culture, you've got to dig into it a little bit because we tend to understate things quite a lot.""

Rebellion's Head of Design Ben Fisher says the goal was to create a ""slightly theme parkish"" version of the Lake District with accurate details.

""There are things that, as locals, it's easy for us to forget are unique to Britain, that are unusual,"" he says.

The team that worked on the game has members from various countries, Ben says, which helped to highlight things the UK natives might have missed.

""The lead artist on the project is from Seattle and was mystified by dry stone walls,""  says Ben.

He adds the team spent time recreating the structures - which are constructed without the use of mortar - to ""capture those local details"".

Featuring a local area in a film or TV show can expose a new audience to that place.

""Ultimately, what's incredibly rewarding about this industry is you can put your ideas down and they can be played by people across the globe,"" Jason says.

""And you know, how wonderful is it to sort of talk about the Lake District to people that live in Africa or Southeast Asia or Canada or wherever it might be.

""That's a kind of form of soft power that very few types of media have.""

Oliver Hodgson, 21, can see Sellafield from his bedroom window.

He hopes that the local area will benefit from some of the soft power Jason describes.

""I think it's just an incredibly powerful thing for young people in west Cumbria,"" he says.

""I think it's really positive to see such a big gaming developer set a story in Cumbria, which is normally just known for its lakes and mountains,"" he says.

Oliver who runs his own PR firm, is working with the creators of a project to createa £4m gaming hub in Whitehavenaimed at boosting digital skills in the area.

Oliver says he's glad the game has taken its inspiration from Windscale and is drawing attention to the area, as well as switching locals on to their history.

""I think we should own it,” he says.

“The story of the Windscale disaster obviously isn't a positive one but we can't rewrite history.

""So acknowledging what happened and teaching and letting young people learn about that history, if this is what brings it into the classroom or on to young people's phones or their social media, then so be it.""

Egypt submarine sinking: What we know so far,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kj9rzmdp9o,BBC,Alex Boyd,27-03-25,"Six people have died after a tourist submarine sank in the Red Sea off the coast of Egypt, a local governor has said.

Among 39 others who were rescued, nine were said to have been injured, while four are in critical condition after the incident early on Thursday morning near the city of Hurghada.

In total, 45 passengers were thought to have been on-board the submarine, called Sindbad, when it sank close to the harbour.

Here's what we know so far.

The Red Sea area governor, Amr Hanafy, said six tourists died and 39 further people were rescued after the submarine sank. No people are missing.

He said the 45 passengers on board were from Russia, India, Norway and Sweden. There were also five Egyptians on board.

All of those who died were from Russia. A Russian official in Hurghada, Viktor Voropaev, said that two of those killed were children.

An earlier statement from the Russian embassy in Egypt had said all of the tourists on board were Russian.

The submarine, Sindbad, had been in operation as a tourist submarine for a number of years.

According to the company running the tourist trips - Sindbad Submarines - its vessels take passengers on journeys to explore coral reefs near the Hurghada coastline.

The company says it holds two of the only ""14 real recreational submarines"" in the world, which hold 44 seats for passengers and two seats for pilots.

Tours are designed for both adults and children, the company's website says, and allow passengers to travel 25 metres (82 feet) underwater.

Dr James Aldridge, who took the same trip on one of the company's submarines last month, said each passenger is given ""a seat on a cushion next to your window and there is a recorded safety brief in multiple languages"".

The vessel ""wasn't cramped or overcrowded"", Dr Aldridge, from Bristol, said, adding that he ""never felt unsafe"".

""The sub departed and we toured the reef for 40 minutes,"" he said. ""For the first 20 I was facing the reef, the sub never strayed 'too close'.""

According to Dr Aldridge, the divers accompanying the submarine ""used fish food to attract the wildlife"" to keep the passengers entertained.

Dr Aldridge said the submarine ""never went close"" to a 25 metre depth.

He was not, however, issued a life jacket.

Benjamin Grey, 50, from Camberley, also took a trip on a Sindbad submarine in February - but had quite a different experience.

He boarded with his 13-year-old daughter and his partner, and said he noticed ""problems"" during the trip, including the submarine surfacing ""at least three times"".

""About halfway through there was a diver who looked like he'd picked up a rock,"" he said. ""He was banging something on the bottom of the submarine. Clearly at some point the submarine had stopped moving and the divers outside were doing something.""

He also said - in contrast to Dr Aldridge - that ""no safety procedures were talked through"".

The submarine sank off the coast of the Egyptian Red Sea city of Hurghada, the BBC understands.

It is believed the incident took place in the harbour. The Russian embassy said it happened around 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT), around 0.6 miles (1km) from the shore.

Hurghada is a popular tourist destination, with its coastline known for its beaches and coral reefs. A number of tourist trip companies operate out of its harbour.

In recent years, there have been other incidents involving Red Sea tourist boats operating out of the city.

In November, a tourist boat called the Sea Story sank, leaving 11 dead or missing - including a British couple - and 35 survivors. The BBC later heardaccusations of safety failings on board.

UK investigators said last monththere had been 16 incidents involving ""liveaboard"" vessels in the area in the last five years, with a number resulting in deaths.

Authorities in Egypt are investigating the cause of the incident, and details are currently unclear.

There continues to be a lot of activity from other boats around the harbour near where the submarine sank.

Red Sea governor Amr Hanafy said the submarine had a valid licence and the crew leader had the correct ""scientific certificates"".

It appeared that the weather was quite calm with no sign of any rough waters.

Gigil: The new word in the dictionary for overwhelming cuteness,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kj9w2zdlgo,BBC,Kelly Ng,27-03-25,"Ever found yourself speechless in the presence of overwhelming cuteness, like your baby nephew or the cat video you saw on Instagram? There's now a word for it: gigil.

Gigil (pronounced ghee-gill) is part of a list of ""untranslatable"" words, or those that do not have English equivalents,that have been added to the Oxford English Dictionary..

Taken from the Philippines' Tagalog language, gigil is a ""feeling so intense that it gives us the irresistible urge to tightly clench our hands, grit our teeth, and pinch or squeeze whomever or whatever it is we find so adorable"".

Alamak, a colloquial exclamation used to convey surprise or outrage in Singapore and Malaysia, also made the list.

""Wouldn't it be useful for English speakers to have a specific word for sunlight dappling through leaves... Or a word for the action of sitting outside enjoying a beer?"" OED said in its latest update.

People who speak English alongside other languages fill lexical gaps by ""borrowing the untranslatable word from another language"". When they do this often enough, the borrowed word ""becomes part of their vocabulary"", OED said.

The majority of newly-added words from Singapore and Malaysia are names of dishes, a testament to the nations' obsessions with food.

These include kaya toast, a popular breakfast option of toasted bread slathered with a jam made from coconut milk, eggs, sugar and pandan leaves;fish head curry, a dish combining Chinese and South Indian influences, where a large fish head is cooked in a tamarind-based curry; and steamboat, a dish of thinly-sliced meat and vegetables cooked in a broth kept simmering in a heated pot.

""All this talk of food might inspire one to get a takeaway, or to tapau,"" OED said, referring to another new word which originated from Mandarin and the Cantonese dialect, meaning ""to package, or wrap up, food to take away"".

Apart from gigil, the newly-added Philippine words include the national pastime of videoke, the local version of karaoke which includes a scoring system, andsalakot, a wide-brimmed, lightweight hat often used by farmers.

Other Philippine additions include what the OED calls ""idiosyncratic uses of existing English words"", such asterror, sometimes used to describe a teacher who is strict, harsh, or demanding.

The OED contains more than 600,000 words, making it one of the most comprehensive dictionaries in the English-speaking world.

Its editors consider thousands of new word suggestions each year. These come from a variety of sources, including  its editors' own reading, crowdsourcing appeals, and analysis of language databases.

Words and phrases fromSouth AfricaandIrelandwere also part of OED's latest update.

Why have the wildfires in S Korea been so devastating?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8l60l8ppzo,BBC,Richard Kim,27-03-25,"Strong winds, dense forest and unusually dry weather - that's the deadly combination that experts say is fuelling the largest wildfires in South Korea's history.

The inferno in the south-east has burned through 35,810 hectares (88,500 acres) as of Thursday - that's about half the size of New York City - killing 27 people so far and displacing tens of thousands.

Authorities believe the wildfires started by accident from human activity, but the main drivers of the devastation are dry land, and strong gusts sweeping over inland regions.

The high concentration of pine forest in North Gyeongsang province, where the fires are burning, is also ""oiling"" the blaze, said a forest disaster expert.

""Pine trees contain resin, which acts like oil, intensifying fires when ignited. This resin causes wildfires to burn faster, stronger, and longer,"" said Lee Byung-doo from the National Institute of Forest Science in Seoul.



Andong, one of the worst-hit cities, is known for its tranquil pine forests.

While they provide shelter and food for local wildlife and sometimes help break the wind, pine trees ""become problematic during wildfires"", Mr Lee told the BBC.

""Because forests [in South Korea] contain large numbers of pine trees, the areas are particularly vulnerable when fires break out,"" he said.

Furthermore, pine trees retain their needles throughout winter, making them susceptible to ""crown fires"" - wildfires that spread by igniting the dense canopy of branches and leaves. This has contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of the flames over the past week.

Unlike neighbouring countries such as China and North Korea, South Korea has made gains in forest cover over recent years.

""Most mountains are now filled with fallen leaves and pine trees... This accumulation has become a significant factor in accelerating the spread of wildfire,"" says Baek Min-ho, a disaster prevention specialist at Kangwon National University.

Climate change is also to blame, experts say.

""This wildfire has once again exposed the harsh reality of a climate crisis unlike anything we've experienced before,"" South Korea's disaster chief Lee Han-kyung said on Thursday.

The ideal environment for these record blazes has been building for the past few weeks, which saw temperatures rise above 20C (68F), unusually high for spring. Analysis by Climate Central, which researches climate science, suggests that these high temperatures have been made up to five times more likely by global warming.

The unusual heat dried out the land and air, allowing fires to spread more rapidly, especially when combined with strong winds.

Dense tree cover and strong winds in the fire-hit region also pose substantial challenges to firefighting efforts.

On Wednesday, a 73-year-old pilot died when his firefighting helicopter crashed in Uiseong county. At least three other firefighters have been killed in the blazes.

Most of the 26 people who died are in their 60s and 70s, officials say. South Korea is an ageing society, where one in five people are at least 65 years old.

North Gyeongsang is its second-oldest province, which also explains the relatively high death toll - it is especially difficult to evacuate older people in a disaster because they may have mobility issues or other health risks.

They may also have more difficulty accessing or interpreting evacuation orders.

Three residents of an elderly care facility in Yeongdeok county died on Wednesday, when the car they were in went up in flames. Only one out of four in the vehicle managed to flee in time, the Korea JoongAng Daily reported.

Acting President Han Duck-soo said on Thursday it was ""worrying"" that many of the victims are elderly, as he ordered the interior minister to relocate to North Gyeongsang to oversee relief efforts.

An Andong resident who evacuated but lost her home told the BBC her family and their neighbours were caught off guard by the fires.

""No one in the village was prepared,"" said the woman, who asked not to be named.

""We had to leave with nothing, and all our belongings are gone. Many of the residents are elderly, so I hope the government can provide temporary shelters where people can stay comfortably,"" she said.

Historical relics have also been burned to the ground - a significant loss to an area considered one of South Korea's cultural centres.

These include treasures in two temples, each more than 1,000 years old. One of them, the Gounsa temple, dates back to the Silla dynasty (57BC to 935AD).

China's dream of becoming a football superpower lies in tatters,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8vp2e7p64o,BBC,Nick Marsh,26-03-25,"On a hot, humid Thursday night in Saitama, China's national football team hit its lowest ebb.

With a minute left on the clock and trailing Japan 6-0, Chinese defenders were likely wishing for the sweet relief of the final whistle.

But Japan's Takefusa Kubo was not feeling charitable. After watching his team-mates toy with their opponents for a while, he received a pass on the edge of the Chinese box and rammed home Japan's seventh goal.

The ball rocketed into the roof of the net, and the man known as ""Japanese Messi"" condemned China to their worst-ever defeat in a World Cup qualifier.

The 7-0 spanking in September - described as ""rock-bottom"" by a Shanghai-based newspaper – followed a year-long line of humiliating defeats which included losses to Oman, Uzbekistan and Hong Kong.

But worse was to come.

A week later dozens of players, coaches and administrators were arrested for gambling, match-fixing and bribery as part of a two-year probe into corruption in the domestic game.

And the defeats have continued. On Tuesday, Australia beat China 2-0 in Hangzhou - cementing them at the bottom of their World Cup qualifying group.

It wasn't long ago that China had dreamed of becoming a footballing superpower.

The world's largest population, a thriving economy and a determined Communist Party led by an avid football fan, President Xi Jinping. What could go wrong?

Apparently, quite a lot.

When Xi came to power in 2012, his love for the sport spurred a drive to reform and improve Chinese football. His dream, he once said, was for China to qualify for the World Cup, host it and, ultimately, win it. These were his ""three wishes"".

But a decade later, even Xi seemed to have lost the faith. While making small talk with Thailand's prime minister on the sidelines of an international summit in 2023, the Chinese president was heard saying that China had ""got lucky"" in a recent victory against Thailand.

""When China's government puts its mind to something, it very rarely fails,"" says Mark Dreyer, a Beijing-based sports writer. ""Look at electric vehicles, look at the Olympics. Practically any sector you can think of, China is right up there.""

But football, it seems, could not thrive in the grip of the Communist Party.

A key government report in 2015 noted that The Chinese Football Association (CFA) must have ""legal autonomy,"" and should be ""independent"" of the General Administration of Sport (GAS).

Even Xi admitted that if China wanted to succeed, then the Party would have to do what it seldom does: let go.

And yet, Beijing didn't let go.

""China's failure in football has become a national embarrassment and figuring out the reasons has become a national obsession,"" Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts: One Man's Quest to Teach the People's Republic of China to Love Football, told the BBC.

""But to me, the reasons are pretty clear and they tell you a lot about how the country is run.""

The problem, he and others argue, is that China's one-party state imposes decisions from the top. While this is effective for economic growth, it yields poor results in competitive team sports.

Although Fifa prohibits state interference, Chinese football is rife with political appointments. This is common in China, where the Party controls most aspects of public life.

The current president of the CFA, Song Cai, is also a Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party. His work, in turn, is overseen by a senior government official at the GAS.

""Everything has to report upwards to Communist Party bosses. It basically means that non-football people are making football decisions,"" Mr Dreyer says. ""Football has to be grassroots-led. You start at the bottom of the pyramid and the talent starts to funnel up to the top.""

All major footballing nations have a ""pyramid"" of leagues. The elite professional clubs sit at the top, supported by a deep pool of semi-professional and amateur teams, all of whose players are vying to work their way up.

Such a pyramid thrives on a culture of playing football, en masse, for fun. The larger the pool to draw from, the better the players at the top will be.

""If you look at every country where football is really successful, the sport has grown organically as a grassroots activity over the past 100 years,"" Mr Simons says. ""Professional football in China has continually failed because it's supported by nothing - their pyramid is upside down.""

The statistics bear this out: England's 1.3 million registered players dwarf China's fewer-than-100,000 footballers. This is in spite of China's population being 20 times larger than England's.

""Kids here don't grow up with a ball at their feet. Without that, you're not going to produce elite talent,"" Mr Dreyer says.

Top-level football in Europe and South America traces its origins to streets and parks in every town and village. In China, however, the push began in Beijing.

It wasn't until the 1990s that the government set up the country's first professional league. It created a handful of top clubs in major cities - but neglected the grassroots.

Keen to impress their bosses, officials in this top-down system inevitably opt for a ""short-termist"" approach that sacrifices genuine improvement over time for quick fixes, Mr Dreyer explains.

Some foreigners who have played in China say such a heavily controlled system also leaves little room for young players to develop a natural understanding of the game.

A European currently playing in China, who did not wish to reveal his name, told the BBC that while many Chinese players are ""technically good"", they lack ""football IQ"" at crucial moments on the pitch.

""Creativity and basic decision-making, which we learn instinctively as a kid, you don't see so much here,"" the player says.

This does not mean that there is not a deep love for football in China.

While the men's team, currently ranked 90th in the world, is seen as a constant disappointment, the women's team, ranked 17th, has been a source of pride for years.

Many in China have referred to them as the ""real"" guozu or national team - and in 2023, a record 53 million people tuned in to watch them play - and lose 6-1 - to England at the World Cup.

The men's Super League boasts the highest average attendance of any league in Asia. At its peak in the 2010s, it was attracting big-name foreign players as it rode a wave of investment from state-owned enterprises, buoyed by a thriving economy.

But it was short-lived.

Since the pandemic and the subsequent economic slowdown in China, more than 40 professional clubs have folded as state-backed companies started to pull their investments. Private companies, too, have proved fickle in their commitment.

In 2015, the Suning Appliance Group, which also used to own the top Italian club Inter Milan, bought Jiangsu FC. The club went on to win the Super League in 2020. But months later, Suning said they were closing the club to focus on their retail business.

The demise of Guangzhou Evergrande, China's most successful team ever, is yet another example.

Bankrolled by property giant Evergrande Group, they won trophy after trophy under the management of Italian greats such as Marcello Lippi and Fabio Cannavaro. But as they found glory at home and in Asia, their parent company was overstretching itself in an inflated property market.

Evergrande is now the world's most indebted property company and the poster-child for China's real estate crisis, with arrears of more than $300bn (£225bn).

Its former club - now in the hands of new owners - wasexpelled from the league in January. After years of splurging, the eight-time champions are still struggling to pay off their debt.

But that is not the only crisis engulfing Chinese football. Its rapid rise created another problem: corruption.

""I should have followed the right path. I was just doing what was customary at the time,"" says Li Tie, the former manager of China's national men's team, in a 2024 documentary.

In that documentary, Li makes a shocking admission: for years he fixed matches and paid bribes to get certain jobs, including 3m yuan (£331,000, $418,500) to become the national team coach in 2019.

Dressed in all-black, he marks a written confession with an inky fingerprint: ""I'm very sorry.""

China's national team was made to watch the documentary by state broadcaster CCTV while preparing for last year's Asian Cup in Qatar.

The primetime expose, co-produced by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), was the first episode of a four-part series on corruption in China called Continued Efforts, Deepening Progress.

In it, dozens of Chinese officials confess - always to camera - to staggering levels of corruption across a variety of industries.

By airing the football episode first, the authorities signalled their serious concern about graft within the sport.

Li, who appeared in a World Cup and once played for Premier League side Everton, is the most high-profile figure to have been apprehended last year in an unprecedented slew of anti-corruption arrests in Chinese football.

In December, he wassentenced to 20 years in jail.

Also publicly shamed in the documentary are former CFA chairman Chen Xuyuan and ex-deputy director of the GAS, Du Zhaocai.

""The corruption of these officials has broken our hearts,"" one fan told CCTV. ""I'm not surprised,"" said another.

The documentary echoed what one ex-national team player told a BBC radio documentary in 2015 in an anonymous interview: that there was a system of ""open bidding"" among players for their spot in the squad.

""I could have won many more caps, but I didn't have the cash,"" he said.

It would take another 10 years before corruption in football exploded into the spotlight. Some suggest this was prompted by China's intolerably bad performances on the pitch.

The struggles of China's men's football team are all the more stark given how other sports are flourishing in the country.

Decades of investment in infrastructure and training have taken China from a sporting backwater to a medal-winning machine that recently equalled the United States with 40 golds at the Paris Olympics.

But many of these are individual sports - weightlifting, swimming, diving -  which require fewer resources and, crucially, less emphasis on community-led grassroots efforts, compared to a game like football.

They are also less lucrative and, therefore, less vulnerable to corruption and mismanagement.

As China's economy reels from a sustained downturn, its officials have bigger challenges than football woes.

But that is little consolation to fans.

The loss to Japan particularly stung. While Japan have gone from strength to strength over the past two decades, China have failed to qualify for a single World Cup.

The day after the loss, the Oriental Sports Daily did not mince its words: ""When the taste of bitterness reaches its extreme, all that is left is numbness.""

According to Mr Dreyer, Japan's approach is antithetical to China's: a long-term vision, a lack of political interference and a commercially savvy club structure.

""Even so, the fan culture here [in China] is still remarkably good,"" he adds. ""They deserve so much more.""

Their disappointment showed following Tuesday's defeat against Australia - but so did their humour.

""It seems like the national team's performance is as consistent as ever,"" wrote one fan on social media. Another joked that if China wants to continue thriving economically, then its football team must suffer so there is a balance in ""national fortune"".

Perhaps they had resigned themselves to what a popular Chinese journalist had written in his blog after Japan beat China.

Football ""cannot be boosted by singing odes or telling stories"", he noted. ""It needs skill, and physical and tactical training. It cannot be accomplished through politics.""

"Five people injured in stabbing in Amsterdam, police say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvge24z1e3xo,BBC,Nathan Williams,27-03-25,"Five people have been injured following a stabbing in central Amsterdam, police say.

The suspect, who has been arrested and will be questioned later on Thursday, was overpowered with the help of a local resident and taken to hospital with a leg injury, police say.

A small area of the central Dam Square remains cordoned off for forensic investigation.

Dutch police say they do not have any details on the condition of the injured people, and the motive for the incident remains unclear.

The number of injured people was for a time said to be four, but in a later update the police said five people were wounded as well as the suspect.

Authorities initially cordoned-off a large area around the Royal Palace in Dam Square, where the emergency helicopter landed.

Images showed a person on a stretcher being loaded into the back of an ambulance.

The injured people were evacuated from the area but an AFP news agency reporter at the scene said there was still a heavy police presence and ambulances.

A witness told the Dutch paper De Telegraaf that they suddenly heard an ""icy scream"" and after that panic broke out in the area.

A shop assistant also said that she heard a lot of shouting and screaming and that people started running, the paper reported.

Witnesses quoted by local media said a girl and an elderly woman were stabbed.

Amsterdam outlet Het Parool quoted a witness saying he approached a girl after hearing a noise. As someone else shouted to call an ambulance, he saw a knife ""sticking out from the girl's back, between her shoulders"", the paper quotes him as saying.

The police have not confirmed who has been stabbed.

Earlier, a police spokesperson told Dutch media there had been reports of a robbery.

They are urging anyone with images of the incident to upload them as evidence.

"RFK cuts 10,000 health department jobs in agency restructuring",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn04dnx94k2o,BBC,Madeline Halpert,27-03-25,"Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr will slash 10,000 jobs from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as a part of a sweeping restructuring.

The move - along with voluntary resignations - will shrink the department's workforce of 80,000 to about 60,000, the White House estimates.

HHS also is consolidating its 28 agency divisions into 15 new sections, including a new Administration for a Healthy America, to help carry out Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again agenda.

""We aren't just reducing bureaucratic sprawl,"" Kennedy said in a statement on Thursday. ""We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.""

In a statement, HHS said the cuts would save taxpayers an estimated $1.8b (£1.38b) per year.

The restructuring comes as President Donald Trump's administration makes broad changes across the government to cut costs, aided by billionaire Elon Musk's  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk and Doge have argued in court documents that Musk's role is advisory only.

HHS - a department with a $1.8 trillion budget that oversees 13 agencies - plans to lay off 3,500 full-time employees at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 2,400 workers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the White House.

The administration is also cutting 1,200 employees from the National Institutes of Health, it said. The remaining employees will be cut from other agencies; officials said FDA inspectors and CDC infectious diseases employees would not be affected.

Kennedy's new Administration for a Healthy America division will focus on maternal and child health, mental health, environmental health and substance abuse.

In a video announcing the changes, Kennedy argued that HHS had been ""inefficient as a whole"" in recent years.

""The rate of chronic disease and cancer increased dramatically as our department has grown,"" he said. ""What we've been doing hasn't worked. That's why we're making this dramatic overhaul.""

In the video, Kennedy noted that the entire federal workforce has been downsized.

""So this will be a painful period for HHS,"" he said.

"VP's arrest ends South Sudan peace deal, his party says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q1jppzp4no,BBC,"Wycliffe Muia, Ashley Lime",27-03-25,"The detention of South Sudan's First Vice-President Riek Machar has effectively collapsed the 2018 peace deal that ended the country's five-year civil war, his party has said.

An armed convoy led by top security officials, including the defence minister, entered Machar's residence in the capital, Juba, and disarmed his bodyguards late on Wednesday, said the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM/IO).

Machar was detained alongside his wife Angelina Teny, who is also the country's interior minister, the party added.

The US has urged the authorities to free Machar, while the UN, African Union and neighbouring countries have all expressed their concern.



The UN Mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, warned that the world's newest nation risked losing the ""hard-won gains of the past seven years"" if it returned to ""a state of war"".

""Tonight, the country's leaders stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict,"" the missionsaid in a statementon Wednesday.

The government is yet to comment on Machar's reported house-arrest.

But addressing religious leaders on Wednesday, President Salva Kiir said ""he will never return the country to war"".

Tensions have been building between Machar and the president for several weeks.

The two leaders agreed in August 2018 to end the civil war between their forces that killed nearly 400,000 people. But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.

Earlier this week, the UN said thatbarrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquidhad been used in airstrikes during fighting between the army and a rebel group previously linked to Machar.

""The arrest and detention of H.E. Dr Riek Machar effectively brings the [peace] agreement to a collapse,"" SPLM/IO deputy leader Oyet Nathaniel Pierino told journalists on Thursday.

""The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,"" he added.

A similar warning was issued by the UN mission in the country, which said the country's leaders ""stand on the brink of relapsing into widespread conflict"".

The situation has been exacerbated by the deployment of Ugandan troops and their battle tanks into South Sudan, following a request by the country's president, according to the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan chair Yasmin Sooka.

She says this raises serious concerns over potential violations of the UN arms embargo and the growing partisan role of foreign forces, which further endangers civilians and risks regional escalation.

Tension remains high in Juba with a heavy military presence reported around Machar's home.

""The public are in a panic,"" civil society leader Edmund Yakani told the AFP news agency.

""There is a high chance of full-scale war but it will be more deadly and more violent because of [the need] for revenge,"" he added.

Pierino called on SPLM/IO members and the public to remain calm as diplomatic efforts continue to resolve the situation.

The BBC understands that the African Union and the regional body, Igad, are expected to send high-level delegations to Juba on Friday, to help curb the escalating crisis.

Reath Muoch Tang, chairman of the party's foreign relations committee, said Machar was under house-arrest, but that security officials initially tried to take him away.

""An arrest warrant was delivered to him under unclear charges,"" Tang said in a statement, calling the action a ""blatant violation of the constitution and the Revitalized Peace Agreement"".

The UN mission warned that violations of the 2018 peace deal ""will not only devastate South Sudan but also affect the entire region"".

The British and US embassies have scaled down their diplomatic staff and urged their citizens to leave the country while the Norwegian and German embassies have closed their operations in Juba.

The US has called on President Kiir to free his rival from the reported house-arrest, urging the two leaders to show commitment to peace.

""We urge President Kiir to reverse this action & prevent further escalation of the situation,"" the US Bureau of African Affairswrote on X.

The escalating tensions come amid renewed clashes between forces loyal to the two rivals in the northern town of Nasir in the oil-rich Upper Nile State.

Politician says no offence meant by two-finger gesture,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce34d5kx1wko,BBC,Kevin Sharkey,27-03-25,"A two-finger gesture by an Irish Parliamentarian has been prominent across social and mainstream media this week.

The politician in question, a highly controversial member of the country's national parliament, subsequently insisted that he meant no offence.

Michael Lowry explained that it was taken out of context, was ""not made with malicious intent"" and he said it was ""not intended to be offensive or to cause offence"".

By then, for many people in Ireland, it was too late, and his explanation didn't really matter.

What mattered much more was that many people in the country felt his gesture was in keeping with the ""shocking"" and ""disgraceful"" scenes witnessed in the chamber in the preceding hour or so.

In the public mind, Lowry's two fingers towards a political opponent spoke louder than any words about the standard of behaviour in the Dáil (lower house of the Irish Parliament) on Tuesday.

No wonder then that newspapers around the country, and beyond, used the image prominently - a classic case of a picture painting many words.

What people outside Ireland could not be expected to know is that the image had added significance for people in Ireland, simply because it was Lowry.

He is a veteran Irish politician whose role in a political and business scandal was found by a tribunal, into certain payments to politicians and related matters, to have been ""disgraceful and insidious"".

Lowry said the 2011 report was ""factually wrong and deliberately misleading"", and that the opinions of the Tribunal chairman, Mr Justice Moriarty, were ""not substantiated by evidence or fact"".

Fast forward to the aftermath of the most recent Irish General Election in November last year.

Lowry was regarded as a kingmaker in the discussions to form a new government.

He was, therefore, viewed as a pivotal player in the build-up to this week's parliamentary session that turned into one of the most disruptive sittings of the Dáil in recent memory,

Of course, he cannot be blamed for the behaviour of hollering and heckling opposition TDs (members of parliament).

But it is a fact that he is widely regarded in the country as the de facto leader of one group of Independent TDs who agreed to support the new Irish government.

In return, the two big parties in the coalition, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, supported the election of a member of that independent group, Verona Murphy, as Speaker of the Dáil.

The independent bloc, with Lowry leading their negotiations, then secured a number of junior ministries for some other members of their relatively small group.

These appointments helped to seal the deal for the formation of the new Irish government.

The public and political consensus at the time was that members of the group had succeeded in punching well above their weight.

But Lowry, as the leader of his group, still wanted more.

Lowry demanded Dáil speaking rights for the remaining members of his government-supporting group, including himself - the ones who did not land plum jobs in the government formation talks.

That single demand by Lowry at the end of last year was a lightning rod for the opposition.

They were of the view that a small group of independent TDs who committed to support the government in good and bad days were then wanting Dáil time to ask questions of the same government.

The opposition believed this would use up valuable parliamentary time that should be reserved for opposition TDs to hold the new government to account.

The opposition parties crystallised Lowry's proposal in the simple mantra ""You can't be in government and opposition at the one time"".

So, this was the catalyst for a parliamentary flare-up whichdelayed the appointment of the new Taoiseach Micheál Martin in January, and again the dispute about this single issue culminated in the chaotic scenes in the Dáil this week.

It was also noteworthy that theSpeaker, Verona Murphy - who now faces a motion of no confidence from the opposition over her handling of the proceedings last Tuesday- was put forward for the post by Lowry's independent group, as part of their deal to support the new government.



So, when Lowry flashed two fingers, in what he himself later described as an ""an errant gesture under provocation"", other members of the Dáil were not the only people in Ireland who had their own view about what the gesture represented.

In his own words, Lowry said he meant no offence but that did not stop people around the country making up their own minds about the symbolism of a two-finger gesture in the national parliament on a day of chaotic and unruly scenes in the Dáil.

"Sutton Hoo helmet may actually come from Denmark, archaeologist suggests",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj92mjd4np1o,BBC,"Adrienne Murray, James Brooks",27-03-25,"A discovery by a metal detectorist in Denmark has raised questions about the origins of the iconic Sutton Hoo helmet, thought for decades to have links to Sweden.

The detectorist found a small metal stamp on an island in southern Denmark, with similar markings to those on the famous helmet.

Peter Pentz, a curator at the National Museum of Denmark, says the discovery raises the possibility the Sutton Hoo helmet may in fact have originated in the country.

The archaeologist told the BBC that if the helmet is indeed proved to have come from Denmark, it could change our understanding of the balance of power in 7th Century northern Europe.

Sutton Hoo is thought to be the burial site of King Raedwald, an East Anglian ruler who died in 624AD.

First excavated in 1939, more than 260 artefacts were uncovered at the Suffolk estate, including an iron and copper clad helmet, considered one of the period's greatest treasures. Other items, like a shield and drinking horns, also show a connection to Scandinavia.

The helmet, now housed in the British Museum, is decorated with various motifs, including two small panels depicting warriors on horseback.

It is believed to have been influenced by earlier Roman style and historians previously thought it may have come from Uppland, in eastern Sweden, as similar motifs depicting warriors on horseback have also been discovered on helmets there. Historians think it might have been an heirloom or diplomatic gift.

But researchers at the National Museum of Denmark now say the recently unearthed metal stamp bears a ""striking similarity"" to the helmet's motifs.

The green-tinged copper alloy stamp was found two years ago, by local archaeologist Jan Hjort. He says he was scouring a field with a metal detector on the Danish island of Taasinge, when he unearthed the metal object.

At first he thought it was a common ""picture plate"", but after closer examination, he realised it was something ""extraordinary"", he told the BBC.

""What is unique is the motif,"" he says. ""It's a very powerful image.""

""The stylistic similarities are so significant,"" Mr Pentz, the curator, says. ""This is the closest link we've ever seen.""

Similar motifs have also been found in Germany, but this is the first unearthed in Denmark.

Mr Hjort's find was handed to a local museum but it has only recently been studied.

The item measures just 5cm by 4cm (2in by 1.6in), and is now believed to be a stamp or ""die"", also known as a ""patrice"".

While the pattern is not identical to the Sutton Hoo helmet, after close study of the two fragmented helmet panels, Mr Pentz says there are ""many similarities"".

""If we focus on the horse itself, we see that it's the same horse,"" he says, pointing to its nose piece, mane, ear and tail.

He thinks the Sutton Hoo and Danish motifs are closer than their Swedish counterparts, suggesting the helmet may have actually originate from, or around, the Danish island.

The curator believes Taasinge may have been home to a 7th Century metal workshop - a thin sheet of silver, possibly used for producing foils, and other metal scraps has been found in the area.

""I would say this die comes from the same workshop, or comes from the environment of the Sutton Hoo helmet,"" Mr Pentz says. ""Production probably took place here or trade.""

The Anglo-Saxon ship burial site at Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, is widely considered to be England's ""Valley of the Kings"". Its 1939 discovery was recently dramatised in the 2021 Netflix film, The Dig.

""It really did revolutionize our understanding of the Anglo-Saxons,"" says Laura Howarth, an archaeology and engagement manager at Sutton Hoo, now a National Trust estate.

Anglo-Saxon refers to groups of people who came to England from Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. Even 86 years later, there have been fresh digs at the site, and new theories emerging about the burials.

The Sutton Hoo helmet was painstakingly pieced back together over many years after it was first uncovered broken into hundreds of pieces. And is now on display at the British Museum. Ms Howarth calls the helmet the ""face of the Anglo-Saxon period"".

""It's the artistry and the craftsmanship behind the helmet,"" she says. The Danish discovery shows Sutton Hoo is ""not a finished book"", Ms Howarth adds.

""Looking at it, it's definitely part of this kind of family of designs that are happening at this time,"" she says, pointing out that there are other items with strong links to Sweden in the Sutton Hoo burial grave and a German motif also shares close similarities.

Mr Pentz believes the new find builds on to a theory that Denmark was more important during this era than previously thought, potentially placing Sweden and England on the periphery of a central Danish ""power base"".

However, the National Trust's Ms Howarth is more sceptical. ""It's quite a lot to pinpoint exactly the relationship and the power dynamic that was existing between Denmark, Sweden and the community at Sutton Hoo at this time, just based off-one find,"" she says.

Mr Pentz says there are ""some obstacles"" to his theory. The Sutton Hoo helmet foils were fragmented into countless pieces and the Danish stamp is very worn.

As a next step he hopes there will be detailed 3D scanning of the motifs.

The find was also discovered in area that has seen little excavation work, and it's possible that the stamp may have been traded or transported from elsewhere.

It will go on display at the country's National Museum in Copenhagen in April.

"China tariffs may be cut to seal TikTok sale, Trump says",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c241ezrpg69o,BBC,Peter Hoskins,27-03-25,"US President Donald Trump says he may cut tariffs on China to help seal a deal for short video app TikTok to be sold by its owner ByteDance.

Trump also said he was willing to extend a 5 April deadline for a non-Chinese buyer of the platform to be found.

In January, hedelayed the implementationof a law passed under the Biden administration to ban TikTok.

The legislation, which was signed into law in 2024, cited national security grounds for the sell or be banned order.

""With respect to TikTok, and China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday.

""Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,"" he added.

Trump also said he expected at least the outline of a deal to be reached by the 5 April deadline.

In response to the comments, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry said Beijing ""has repeatedly stated its position. China's opposition to the imposition of additional tariffs has always been consistent and clear"".

Trump made the comments afterannouncing new import taxes of 25% on all cars and car partscoming into the US in a move that threatens to widen the global trade war.

The BBC has contacted TikTok for comment.

The biggest sticking point to finalising a deal to sell the TikTok business, which is worth tens of billions of dollars, has always been securing Beijing's agreement.

Trump has previously tried to use tariffs as leverage in the negotiations.

On his first day back in the White House, on 20 January, the president threatened more import duties on China if it did not approve a TikTok deal.

The hugely popular app is used by around 170 million Americans.

Trump, who called for TikTok to be banned in his first term as president, now has an account on the platform.

He has more than 15 million followers and has said he received billions of views on the app during his presidential election campaign.

Separately, the US increased levies on all imports from China to 20% this month.

That doubled the tariffs Trump imposed on the world's second largest economy on4 February.

On 10 February, China responded with its own tariffs, including a 10-15% tax on some US agricultural goods.

Beijing has also targeted various US aviation, defence and tech firms by adding them to an ""unreliable entity list"" and imposing export controls.

The 10% levy doubled to 20% on 4 March.

China has urged the US to return to dialogue with Beijing as soon as possible.

February's spell in the Middle East ended in distressing fashion, as a man who had been following Raducanu around the circuit was evicted from her second-round match and given a restraining order.

Raducanu appeared rudderless for much of that period, although she was rarely short of support. Her strength and conditioning coach Yutaka Nakamura has barely left her side since starting in early December.

Roman Kelecic, a coach from her teenage days, helped out in Abu Dhabi. Jane O'Donoghue, a friend and former LTA coach, was in Doha and Dubai. Tom Welsh was drafted in from the Loughborough Academy as a short-term hire for Indian Wells, only for Vladimir Platenik to usurp him by arriving in California for a hastily arranged trial.

After only two weeks that trial was ended by Raducanu on the eve of her first-round victory in Miami - and a seat offered once again to OâDonoghue and the broadcaster and coach Mark Petchey.

How 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach

Second Serve: Your new weekly tennis briefing

Petchey coached an 18-year-old Andy Murray for 10 months - during which he won his first ATP title - and trained with Raducanu during the pandemic summer of 2020.

Those weeks at the National Tennis Centre in London appear to have left quite an impression on Raducanu. There is a mutual respect and rapport between the two.

O'Donoghue has been a regular confidante for Raducanu, and was the LTAâs national womenâs coach until 2019, when she left the sport for pastures new.

Raducanu trusts them and is able to relax in their company, but they both have day jobs.

Petchey is in broadcasting - most notably with the Tennis Channel - and OâDonoghue in finance. She is currently on a sabbatical, but there is no suggestion she wants to return to the far less secure world of tennis coaching on a permanent basis.

Both could offer input but, as things stand, not the type of support Raducanu said she was seeking when speaking to the BBC at Indian Wells.

""Once I have a structure in place and I can fall back on the process again I will feel very set,"" she said this month.

""In the Middle East it was very difficult for me because I didn't really have any direction or structure or which tournaments to play and it was very difficult doing it all on my own.

""I'm that kind of person who needs a plan and needs preparation. That's what I'm building and that's making me feel more comfortable.""

Jane O'Donoghue (left) was with Emma Raducanu in Miami

Raducanu is part of the Great Britain team which will compete in the Billie Jean King Cup qualifying round in early April, and will be able to spend the next two weeks working with the LTA coaching team.

But she will need a more lasting plan swiftly.

Her clay-court season could take in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome before thre French Open, and there will be very little respite in the schedule before the end of October.

That plan does not need to revolve around one person.

Many top players employ more than one coach, usually because it is very hard for any one individual to commit to more than 30 weeks on the road each year.

Jack Draper ended last summerâs partnership with Wayne Ferreira as he preferred the ""one voice"" of James Trotman, but now travels to some events with Alex Ward.

Perhaps things could have worked out differently with Cavaday if an additional coach had been brought into the team when his health problems first arose in the spring of 2024.

Exposure to different personalities and ways of thinking has always been appealing to Raducanu, but the period with Cavaday offered her stability and calmness.

They liked each other, having first established a coaching partnership when Raducanu was a girl. Cavaday was a good sounding board, and there was evidence from her play last spring and summer that the two could flourish in future.

Other partnerships fizzled out much more quickly.

Platenik lasted only two weeks. His coaching acumen is widely admired, but his personality did not seem a good match for Raducanu.

One former player compared him to a ""freight train"", saying he was intense and opinionated. Platenik says Raducanu told him she was feeling âstressedâ when ending the brief collaboration.

Torben Beltz looked an excellent choice, given his Grand Slam success with Angelique Kerber, but Raducanu did not feel he had enough to offer.

Dmitry Tursunov ended their partnership because he thought Raducanu needed to listen to just ""one voice"". He referred to ""red flags"" and a feeling there may be further problems down the line.

Her spell with Sebastian Sachs concluded after operations on both hands and left ankle, which kept her on the sidelines for the second half of 2023.

There did not seem much logic in dispensing of the services of Nigel Sears after Wimbledon 2021, but it is hard to argue with the choice of Andrew Richardson, who then steered her to that historic triumph at the US Open.

However, that partnership ended there.

Would Raducanu go back to a coach she has previously let go? Sears still looks a good bet and has a proven track record of success with Daniela Hantuchova, Ana Ivanovic and Anett Kontaveit.

He is no longer working with the Australian Olivia Gadecki, and is a regular at the National Tennis Centre in London, where he works with the LTA's women's team.

For all her progress in Miami, Raducanu may have a difficult spring and summer without the right personnel around her.

Does she ever throws a covetous glance at Draper's set-up?

His team looks a thoroughly professional outfit, and some hard decisions have recently been made.

Physio Will Herbert and strength and conditioning coach Steve Kotze are no longer involved. They have been replaced by Shane Annun and Matt Little, who were so integral to Andy Murray's team.

And Trotman remains as head coach. He has been working full-time with the new Indian Wells champion since the end of 2021, in which time Draper has risen from outside the top 250 and into the world's top 10.

Red Bull confirm Tsunoda to replace Lawson,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/cdxq14pp27yo,BBC,Andrew Benson,27-03-25,"Yuki Tsunoda's first race with the senior Red Bull team will be the Japanese Grand Prix, from 4-6 April

Red Bull have confirmed that they will demote Liam Lawson and replace him with Yuki Tsunoda with immediate effect.

The decision comes after Lawson had completed just two grands prix for Red Bull, and three months after Tsunoda was passed over for the New Zealanderas a replacement for Sergio Perez.

Tsunoda, 24, will partner Max Verstappen at Red Bull from the next race in Japan on 4-6 April, while Lawson will return to second team Racing Bulls as team-mate to French rookie Isack Hadjar.

Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said in a statement: ""It has been difficult to see Liam struggle with the RB21 at the first two races and as a result we have collectively taken the decision to make an early switch.""

Red Bull are third in the constructors' championship after two races, behind McLaren and Mercedes, and Verstappen has expressed his belief that their car may be only the fourth fastest in the field.

The Dutchman was a close second behind race-winner Lando Norris' McLaren in the wet season-opening Australian Grand Prix, and fourth at the Chinese race last weekend.

Lawson qualified 18th in Melbourne and crashed out of the race. In China, he qualified last for both the sprint and the grand prix, and finished 14th and 12th.

His finishing position in the grand prix in Shanghai was boosted by the disqualifications of both Ferraris and Pierre Gasly's Alpine, without which he would have been 15th.

Horner's statement said: ""We acknowledge there is a lot of work to be done with the RB21 and Yuki's experience will prove highly beneficial in helping to develop the current car.""

The decision to swap Lawson and Japanese Tsunoda was made on Monday at a meeting of Red Bull bosses in Dubai, including Horner and the chief shareholder Chalerm Yoovidhya.

When Red Bull made the decision to pay off Perez two years before the end of his contract at the conclusion of last season, they chose Lawson because they believed Tsunoda lacked the mental fortitude to be Verstappen's team-mate and that Lawson had more potential.

That was despite the fact the 23-year-old New Zealander had completed just 11 grands prix over two seasons for Red Bull's second team.

At the time, Red Bull's car had fallen from competitiveness and, although Verstappen clinched a fourth consecutive world title, he won only twice in the final 14 races of the 2024 season.

The car appears not to have improved in relative competitiveness over the winter, and Verstappen is continuing to complain it has balance problems that affect its performance.

What's the future for F1 engines and why is it up for debate?

Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions

Red Bull have long been renowned for the ruthlessness with which they handle their young driver programme, but even in that context dropping Lawson after two races is extraordinary.

Horner's statement said: ""We have a duty of care to protect and develop Liam and together we see that, after such a difficult start, it makes sense to act quickly so Liam can gain experience as he continues his F1 career with Racing Bulls, an environment and a team he knows very well.""

Tsunoda's debut for the senior team will come at his home race at Suzuka, a track that is owned by Japanese car company Honda, which is Red Bull's engine partner and has long been a backer of the driver's career.

He has been with Red Bull's second team, previously called Alpha Tauri and RB, since making his F1 debut in 2021.

His promotion is an opportunity to secure his F1 career, at a time when his future in the sport was looking uncertain.

Honda is moving to Aston Martin for 2026 and there is no space for Tsunoda at that team.

If he can prove himself at Red Bull, he has the opportunity to show the team's bosses that he should be considered as a future driver for their team despite their long scepticism over his ultimate potential.

Tsunoda has had a positive start to the 2025 season, qualifying fifth in Australia and ninth in China, where he finished sixth in the sprint race.

Lawson will be advised that his demotion is an opportunity for him to rebuild his career, in the same way as earlier Red Bull rejects Gasly and Alex Albon have done.

Gasly was demoted to the second Red Bull team after just half a season in 2019 in a swap with Albon, who was given a season and a half before being demoted to reserve driver in place of Perez.

Gasly has since moved to Alpine and Albon to Williams, and both have thrived.

Perez no longer has an F1 seat after being dropped at the end of last season with a pay-off worth many millions of dollars.

Kenya keeper the subject of match-fixing investigation,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cqlyqp0en07o,BBC,,27-03-25,"Patrick Matasi made his international debut in 2017 but has not appeared for Kenya since last year

The Kenya Football Federation (FKF) has launched an investigation into allegations that goalkeeper Patrick Matasi has been involved in match manipulation.

The 37-year-old, who plays for Kenyan Premier League club Kakamega Homeboyz, has won over 30 international caps.

His most recent appearance for the Harambee Stars came in October last year, in a qualifier for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.

An undated video posted online - which the BBC has not been able to verify - appears to show Matasi agreeing a deal to influence the outcome of a league game.

""I have spoken to him. He was also shocked at what he was seeing in the video and he told me he doesn't know about match-fixing,"" Homeboyz owner Cleophas Shimanyula told BBC Sport Africa.

The FKF said it would work with world governing body Fifa, the Confederation of African Football and other ""relevant authorities"" during its investigation.

""We reaffirm our zero-tolerance policy on match manipulation and are committed to safeguarding the credibility of our competitions,"" a statement added.

""This investigation will adhere to FKF's anti-match manipulation regulations and Fifa guidelines, ensuring a fair, transparent, and thorough process.

""The rights of the player and his club will be respected, and appropriate action will be taken based on the findings.""

BBC Sport Africa has contacted Matasi for comment.

Shimanyula backed Matasi, pointing to the fact the veteran has kept three clean sheets in as many games since joining the club a month ago.

""When we watched this video, we found that Matasi has not wronged the club,"" he said.

""In a video there can misinterpretations and false narratives and we cannot trust everything.

""He will keep playing for us because there's no wrongdoing on his part as far as we are concerned - unless there's evidence or the FKF writes to us to say they are suspecting the player of some wrongdoing.

""He is innocent until proven guilty and then we will act.""

The FKF has called on anyone with credible information to assist its investigation, with any reports to be handled with strict confidentiality.

Shimanyula also challenged the Kenyan footballing community to provide evidence against Matasi.

""Kakamega Homeboyz is against any form of match manipulation,"" he said.

""In the past we've reported match-fixing regarding some of our players who fixed a game with the coach and punishments were handed down by Fifa.

""We have our own internal systems that we use to also look at match-fixing and I cannot speak on behalf of other clubs.

""As Kakamega Homeboyz we are asking anyone who has evidence of Matasi fixing a game to bring it forward.""

James scores late as Lakers end losing streak,https://www.bbc.com/sport/basketball/articles/ckgn7d48g8vo,BBC,,27-03-25,"Lebron James won the game just before the buzzer sounded

LeBron James scored the match winner with time almost up as the Los Angeles Lakers ended their losing streak with victory against the Indiana Pacers.

The Pacers held a one-point lead with 42 seconds remaining, but James was on hand to tip in a Luka Doncic miss a split-second before the buzzer to secure a 120-119 victory in Indianapolis.

James did not make a field goal until the fourth quarter but finished the night with 13 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists.

""It's another great example of where he doesn't necessarily have it going early, and got off to a slow start offensively but he was so good defensively and then takes over in the fourth quarter"" Lakers coach J.J. Redick said.

""He gets rewarded by the basketball gods because he didn't let go of the rope and didn't stop competing.""

The Lakers, fourth in the western conference, improved their record to 44-28 after ending three-game losing run.

Doncic had 34 points, seven rebounds and seven assists for Los Angeles, while Austin Reaves scored 24 and Rui Hachimura added 14.

Elsewhere on Wednesday, the Washington Wizards ended a five-game losing streak with victory against the Philadelphia 76ers, while the Toronto Raptors routed the Brooklyn Nets 116-86.

Nikola Jokic scored 39 points - and secured his 30th triple-double of the season - on his return from injury to inspire the Denver Nuggets to a 127-117 win against the Milwaukee Bucks, while the Boston Celtics extended their winning streak to seven  with a 132-102 win against the Phoenix Suns.

The Los Angeles Clippers kept their play-off hopes alive by coming back from 14 points down to defeat the New York Knicks 126-113, improving their record to 41-31.

Premier League to have two transfer windows this summer,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c0egvyg7wllo,BBC,Russell Fuller,27-03-25,"Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca (left) and Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola could use the earlier window to sign players for the Club World Cup

The Premier League has announced it will have two transfer windows this summer to allow Manchester City and Chelsea to sign players before the Club World Cup.

The window will open between Sunday, 1 June and Tuesday, 10 June, then close for five days before running again from Monday, 16 June until Monday, 1 September.

This summer features the first expanded Fifa Club World Cup, which involves 32 teams and adopts the format of the regular World Cup of the past few years.

Chelsea and Manchester City are the Premier League teams in the tournament which takes place in the United States from Sunday, 15 June.

But the Premier League can only have 12 weeks of a summer window - hence the five-day break in order to run it until 1 September.

Fifa has allowed new players to be registered for the Club World Cup from 1-10 June, and again from 27 June-3 July for the knockout stage.

Firstly, to bring order to the global registration system, world governing body Fifa only permits the transfer window in any individual country to be open for 16 weeks in any calendar year.

In Europe, precedent dictates four of those weeks are for the winter window, leaving 12 in the summer. In 2024, the Premier League transfer window opened on 14 June and closed on 30 August.

However, in October, Fifa approved an additional window from 1-10 June that would allow the 32 clubs competing in the Club World Cup to register new players before the tournament.

It also agreed to open a registration window mid-tournament, from 27 June and 3 July, to allow clubs to register additional players for the knockout stage.

As well as Manchester City and Chelsea, European heavyweights Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid, Inter Milan, Juventus, Paris St-Germain, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal are among others playing in the tournament.

In order to ensure Manchester City and Chelsea did not have an advantage over the other 18 top-flight clubs, the Premier League has adopted the same window.

However, 12 weeks from 1 June is 24 August. The Premier League wanted to be aligned with the rest of Europe's big leagues around when the summer window closes. Those leagues preferred to close the window at the end of August, so that meant the window had to close and reopen.

Firstly, the dates.

The Champions League final takes place in Munich on 31 May. After that, there are Nations League semi-finals and finals and World Cup qualifying double-headers. In Europe, those games take place 6-10 June.

It means players could be negotiating transfers in the build-up to important matches.

One potential impact concerns international players who may move to clubs competing in the Club World Cup.

Let us take two examples - Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kevin de Bruyne. Both are internationals who might be called up by England and Belgium for their June matches.

However, both are out of contract at Liverpool and Manchester City respectively on 30 June.

Alexander-Arnold currently plays for a club not involved in the United States this summer, butlooks likely to join Real Madrid who are.

So, do Real reach an agreement over a fee with Liverpool to trigger Alexander-Arnold's release early so he can play a full part in the competition? Or do they wait until 30 June and add him to their squad for the knockout stage?

Manchester City are involved in the Club World Cup. So, as it presently stands, De Bruyne could play in the group stage but would not be eligible for the knockout stage.

If De Bruyne does not want to commit for a further year, he could sign a short extension that covers the tournament and then leave. Or he could leave before the tournament and sign for a different club. If that club were also involved at the Club World Cup, De Bruyne would be in the same situation as Alexander-Arnold.

Fifa has also tweaked its registration rules to effectively mean clubs can sign players solely for the duration of the tournament. It is thought unlikely either Manchester City or Chelsea would be looking at that scenario.

Man City and Chelsea could earn Â£97m at Club World Cup

How does the new Club World Cup work & why is it so controversial?

How clubs kept to spending rules & what next?

Semi-automated offside technologymight be introduced to the Premier League in April.

It was trialled in the FA Cup fifth round - and will be tried again for the three quarter-final ties at Premier League grounds this weekend.

The plan was to introduce it for the Premier League in October or November, but issues with the system have delayed that.

If no problems arise from these FA Cup games, it will be rolled out in the Premier League next week.

Semi-automated offsides are designed to make the judgement of tight calls easier for officials by rendering key parts of the process automatic.

Bespoke cameras have been installed at all 20 Premier League grounds.

In the last round of the FA Cup there was a record eight-minute VAR stoppage during Bournemouth's win against Wolves when officialswere unable to rely on the new technologybecause of a congested penalty area.

Lawson will be advised that his demotion is an opportunity for him to rebuild his career, in the same way as earlier Red Bull rejects Gasly and Alex Albon have done.

Gasly was demoted to the second Red Bull team after just half a season in 2019 in a swap with Albon, who was given a season and a half before being demoted to reserve driver in place of Perez.

Gasly has since moved to Alpine and Albon to Williams, and both have thrived.

Perez no longer has an F1 seat after being dropped at the end of last season with a pay-off worth many millions of dollars.

Were Ferrari at fault or unlucky with disqualifications?
