    "Since this is my first attempt at scraping data, I will begin by examining only trustworthy news outlets. I believe that starting with the BBC would be the easiest, as I did my research and found out that they were ranked as the 4th most trusted news by Americans. Even though we live in Europe, I choose to believe this statistic. Later on, I plan to expand my list of trustworthy sources, but for now, this is my starting point, so bare with me.\n",
