      "['The main rival to Turkey\\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been formally arrested and charged with corruption.\\r\\n\\r\\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of Istanbul, is expected to be selected as the opposition Republican People\\'s Party\\'s (CHP) 2028 presidential candidate in a ballot on Sunday.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. \"I will never bow,\" he wrote on X before he was remanded in custody.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis detention sparked some of Turkey\\'s largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\\r\\n\\r\\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday, triggering four consecutive nights of demonstrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Sunday, he was formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was remanded in custody pending trial. Local media reported he had been taken to Marmara Prison in Silivri.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn social media posts, Imamoglu criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\", and said judicial procedure was not being followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe urged people across the country to join protests and to take part in Sunday\\'s vote. Imamoglu is the only person running in the CHP\\'s presidential candidate selection.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutors want to charge him with \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but the Turkish court said it was \"not deemed necessary at this stage\" to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CHP had a de facto alliance with the pro-Kurdish Peoples\\' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) in connection with last year\\'s local elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nDEM has been accused of being affiliated with the PKK - or Kurdistan Workers\\' Party - which it denies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe PKK declared a ceasefire early this month, after waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than 40 years. It is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\\r\\n\\r\\nImamoglu is seen as one of Erdogan\\'s most formidable political rivals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe arrest does not prevent his candidacy and election as president. However, if he is convicted of any of the charges against him he would not be able to run.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day before his arrest, Istanbul University announced it was revoking Imamoglu\\'s degree due to alleged irregularities, a measure - which if upheld - would put his ability to run as president into doubt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the Turkish constitution, presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\\r\\n\\r\\nImamoglu\\'s lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.\\r\\n\\r\\nErdogan has held office for the past 22 years, as both prime minister and president of Turkey.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, due to term limits, he cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nOpposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the Ministry of Justice has criticised those who link Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands have taken to the streets across Turkey in largely peaceful demonstrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorities tried to stifle demonstrations with a four-day ban on all gatherings in Istanbul, which was extended to Ankara and Izmir as the protests spread.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiot police have repeatedly clashed with protesters and could be seen firing pepper gas and water cannons towards crowds of demonstrators.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurkish authorities said 343 people were arrested on Friday night.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Saturday, tear gas hung in the air outside the mayor\\'s office in Istanbul before the protests had even properly begun.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the crowds had grown throughout the evening, it became hard to breathe as round after round was fired to disperse demonstrators.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanting \"rights, law, justice\", people of all ages defied the government ban to protest against what they see as an unlawful detention.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne young woman, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, told the BBC she was not protesting for political reasons or because she supported the opposition, but instead to defend democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'m here for justice, I\\'m here for liberty. We\\'re free people and Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother woman, who had brought her 11-year-old son to the protests, said she wanted to include him because she is worried about his future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s getting harder to live in Turkey day by day, we can\\'t control our lives, we can\\'t choose who we want and there is no real justice here,\" she said.\\r\\n\\r\\n'\n",
      " \"More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry has announced.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat number - 50,021 - equates to about 2.1% of the 2.3 million pre-war population of the territory, or around 1 in 46 people.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 113,274 others had been injured in the same period, the health ministry said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFigures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently disputed data published by Gaza's authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe figures released by the MoH for the number of people killed do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November, the UN's Human Rights Office said its analysis showedclose to 70% of verified victims over a six-month period were women and children.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn January, The Lancet medical journal published a study which suggested thedeath toll could in fact be substantially higherthan official figures reported by MoH - by up to 41%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsrael responded to the 7 October attack with a massive military offensive, which has caused vast destruction to homes and infrastructure, in addition to those killed or injured.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe MoH also reported on Sunday at least 39 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people killed to 673 since Israel resumed its military operations in the territory on Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\n",

      " 'If there s one thing President Barack Obama isn t threatened by, it s Donald Trump.After the Brexit decision, in which the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, many Americans were left upset and afraid that what had happened overseas could be a sign that Trump might actually win the election. Trump himself has definitely played up those fears in his statements following the decision by making statements such as,  I really see a parallel between what is happening here and in the U.S.  and voters  will have the chance to re-declare their independence  in November. Luckily, Obama is setting the record straight.In an interview with NPR s Steve Inskeep, it was clear that Obama wanted Americans to know that there were distinct differences between America and Britain, and that the Brexit vote wasn t a warning about what might happen in November. In fact, Obama was confident enough to actually laugh when Inskeep asked him about Trump s statement that Americans will be able to reject  the global elite  in the general election. Obama took a swipe at the billionaire business mogul: Mr. Trump embodies global elites and has taken full advantage of it his entire life. So, he s hardly a spokesperson, a legitimate spokesperson for a populist surge of working-class people on either side of the Atlantic. Obama urged Americans to stay calm, saying that he didn t think Brexit would lead to any  major, cataclysmic changes.  He said: I think that the best way to think about this is, a pause button has been pressed on the project of full European integration. I would not overstate it. There s been a little bit of hysteria post-Brexit vote, as if somehow NATO s gone, the trans-Atlantic alliance is dissolving, and every country is rushing off to its own corner. That s not what s happening. Obama stated that the U.S. and Europe still have similar international interests. He said: The basic core values of Europe, the tenants of liberal market-based democracies; those aren t changing.

      " 'The Syrian army and its allies have taken full control of Deir al-Zor city from Islamic State, the largest and most important city in eastern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday. There was no immediate comment from Syrian state media, but a commander in a military alliance fighting in support of Damascus said that while advances had been made, some IS-held pockets still remained in the city. The Syrian army launched its attack against Islamic State there in September, backed by Russian air strikes and fighting alongside Iran-backed militias and the Lebanese Shi ite group Hezbollah. The Islamist group had held most of the city since 2014, except for one large pocket where Syrian army troops and 93,000 civilians had been holed up for three years. The provincial capital is located on the western side of the Euphrates River. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by the U.S.-led coalition, launched their own attack on Islamic State in the province in September, advancing along the eastern side of the river. The city s strategic significance for Islamic State stemmed from its location near the Iraqi border, where the group also controlled territory, as well as its importance as the oil-producing province s capital. The recovery of the eastern province s capital underscores President Bashar al Assad s re-established control over the eastern part of Syria. As the army has pushed east in recent months, oil and gas fields have once more fallen to the government, as well as to the SDF. Islamic State still controls parts of Deir al-Zor province, its territory extending across the border to neighboring Iraq where Iraqi forces are waging a separate offensive against the militant group. The Islamist group also controls a small pocket in Hama province in western Syria, and a besieged enclave south of Damascus where it is fighting rebel factions. The Syrian army is also advancing on Albu Kamal city in Deir al-Zor province, located on the Iraqi-Syrian border. Russian bombers struck Islamic State targets in the border town on Thursday, RIA news agency reported.'\n",
      " 'The United States will give Israel $38 billion in military assistance over the next decade, the largest such aid package in U.S. history, under a landmark agreement signed on Wednesday. The deal, whose details were reported by Reuters earlier, will allow Washington‚Äôs chief Middle East ally to upgrade most of its fighter aircraft, improve its ground forces‚Äô mobility and strengthen its missile defense systems, a senior U.S. official said. While the package constitutes the most U.S. military aid ever given to any country, it entails concessions by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, according to officials on both sides. Those include Israel‚Äôs promise not to seek additional funds from Congress beyond what will be guaranteed annually in the new package, and to phase out a special arrangement that has allowed Israel to spend part of its U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons, the officials said. Nearly 10 months of drawn-out aid negotiations underscored continuing friction between President Barack Obama and Netanyahu over last year‚Äôs U.S.-led nuclear deal with Israel‚Äôs arch-foe Iran, an accord the Israeli leader opposed. The United States and Israel have also been at odds over the Palestinians. But the right-wing Netanyahu decided it would be best to forge a new arrangement with Obama, who leaves office in January, rather than hoping for better terms from the next U.S. administration, according to officials on both sides. A new pact now allows him to avoid uncertainties surrounding the next president, whether Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump, and to give Israel‚Äôs defense establishment the ability to plan ahead. Obama‚Äôs aides wanted a new deal before his presidency ends, seeing it as an important part of his legacy. Republican critics accuse him of not being attentive enough to Israel‚Äôs security, which the White House strongly denies, and of taking too hard of a line with the Israeli leader. The $38 billion memorandum of understanding covers U.S. fiscal years 2019-2028 and succeeds the current $30 billion MOU signed in 2007, which expires at the end of fiscal 2018. ‚ÄúPrime Minister Netanyahu and I are confident that the new MOU will make a significant contribution to Israel‚Äôs security in what remains a dangerous neighborhood,‚Äù Obama said in a written statement. The agreement was signed at the State Department by U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon and by Jacob Nagel, acting head of Netanyahu‚Äôs national security council. According to a White House ‚Äúfact sheet,‚Äù the deal includes: -annual payments of $3.3 billion in so-called foreign military financing -$500 million a year for Israeli missile defense funding, the first time this has been formally built into the aid pact. -A phasing-out of a special arrangement that for decades has allowed Israel to use 26.3 percent of the U.S. aid on its own defense industry instead of on American-made weapons. -Elimination of a longstanding provision that has allowed Israel to use about 13 percent of the U.S. aid to buy military fuel. -The funding will allow Israel to update ‚Äúthe lion‚Äôs share‚Äù of its fighter aircraft, including purchasing additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Israel is scheduled to receive 33 F-35 aircraft, the first two of which will be delivered in December.']\n"
