      "['The main rival to Turkey\\'s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been formally arrested and charged with corruption.\\n\\nEkrem Imamoglu, the mayor of the Turkish city of Istanbul, is expected to be selected as the opposition Republican People\\'s Party\\'s (CHP) 2028 presidential candidate in a ballot on Sunday.\\n\\nHe denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated. \"I will never bow\", he was quoted as saying after being remanded in custody pending trial.\\n\\nHis detention has sparked off some of the largest protests in more than a decade. Erdogan has condemned the demonstrations and accused the CHP of trying to \"disturb the peace and polarise our people\".\\n\\nImamoglu was one of more than 100 people, including other politicians, journalists and businessmen, detained as part of an investigation on Wednesday.\\n\\nOn Sunday, he was formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\".\\n\\nProsecutors want to charge him with \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but the Turkish court said it was \"not deemed necessary at this stage\" to do so.\\n\\nThe CHP had a de facto alliance with the pro-Kurdish Peoples\\' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) in connection with last year\\'s local elections.\\n\\nDEM has been accused of being affiliated with the PKK - or Kurdistan Workers\\' Party - which it denies. The PKK declared a ceasefire early this month, after waging an insurgency against Turkey for more than 40 years. It is proscribed as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US.\\n\\nImamoglu is seen as one of Erdogan\\'s most formidable political rivals. He is the only person running in the CHP\\'s presidential candidate selection.\\n\\nThe arrest does not prevent his candidacy and election as president. However, if he is convicted of any of the charges against him he would not be able to run.\\n\\nA day before his arrest, Istanbul University announced it was revoking Imamoglu\\'s degree due to alleged irregularities, a measure - which if upheld - would put his ability to run as president into doubt.\\n\\nAccording to the Turkish constitution, presidents must have completed higher education to hold office.\\n\\nImamoglu\\'s lawyers said they would appeal the decision to revoke his degree to the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights.\\n\\nThe Supreme Election Council will decide whether Imamoglu is qualified to be a candidate.\\n\\nErdogan has held office for the past 22 years, as both prime minister and president of Turkey. However, due to term limits, he cannot run for office again in 2028 unless he changes the constitution.\\n\\nOpposition figures say the arrests are politically motivated. But the Ministry of Justice has criticised those who link Erdogan to the arrests, and insist on its judicial independence.\\n\\nThousands have taken to the streets across Turkey in largely peaceful demonstrations.\\n\\nAuthorities tried to stifle demonstrations with a four-day ban on all gatherings in Istanbul, which was extended to Ankara and Izmir as the protests spread.\\n\\nRiot police have repeatedly clashed with protesters and could be seen firing pepper gas and water cannons towards crowds of demonstrators.\\n\\nTurkish authorities said 343 people were arrested on Friday night.\\n\\nOn Saturday, tear gas hung in the air outside the mayor\\'s office in Istanbul before the protests had even properly begun.\\n\\nAs the crowds had grown throughout the evening, it became hard to breathe as round after round was fired to disperse demonstrators.\\n\\nChanting \"rights, law, justice\", people of all ages defied the government ban to protest against what they see as an unlawful detention.\\n\\nOne young woman, dressed in black and wearing a face mask, told the BBC she was not protesting for political reasons or because she supported the opposition, but instead to defend democracy.\\n\\n\"I\\'m here for justice, I\\'m here for liberty. We\\'re free people and Turkish people cannot accept this. This is against our behaviour and culture.\"\\n\\nAnother woman, who had brought her 11-year-old son to the protests, said she wanted to include him because she is worried about his future.\\n\\n\"It\\'s getting harder to live in Turkey day by day, we can\\'t control our lives, we can\\'t choose who we want and there is no real justice here,\" she said.\\n\\n'\n",
      " \"More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's military campaign in Gaza, the territory's Hamas-run health ministry has announced.\\n\\nThat number - 50,021 - equates to about 2.1% of the 2.3 million pre-war population of the territory, or around 1 in 46 people.\\n\\nA total of 113,274 others had been injured in the same period, the health ministry said.\\n\\nFigures from the Gaza Ministry of Health (MoH) have been widely used throughout the war and are seen as reliable by the United Nations (UN) and international institutions. But Israel has consistently refuted data published by Gaza's authorities.\\n\\nInternational journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.\\n\\nThe figures released by the MoH for the number of people killed do not differentiate between civilians and fighters.\\n\\nIn November, the UN's Human Rights Office said its analysis showedclose to 70% of verified victims over a six-month period were women and children.\\n\\nIn January, The Lancet medical journal published a study which suggested thedeath toll could in fact be substantially higherthan official figures reported by MoH - by up to 41%.\\n\\nThe war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, were killed and 251 other taken hostage.\\n\\nIsrael responded to the 7 October attack with a massive military offensive, which has caused vast destruction to homes and infrastructure, in addition to those killed or injured.\\n\\nThe MoH also reported on Sunday at least 39 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of people killed to 673 since Israel resumed its military operations in the territory on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"\n",
      " 'Saira Baloch was 15 when she stepped into a morgue for the first time.\\n\\nAll she heard in the dimly-lit room were sobs, whispered prayers and shuffling feet. The first body she saw was a man who appeared to have been tortured.\\n\\nHis eyes were missing, his teeth had been pulled out and there were burn marks on his chest.\\n\\n\"I couldn\\'t look at the other bodies. I walked out,\" she recalled.\\n\\nBut she was relieved. It wasn\\'t her brother - a police officer who had been missing for nearly a year since he was arrested in 2018 in a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan, one of Pakistan\\'s most restive regions.\\n\\nInside the morgue, others continued their desperate search, scanning rows of unclaimed corpses. Saira would soon adopt this grim routine, revisiting one morgue after another. They were all the same: tube lights flickering, the air thick with the stench of decay and antiseptic.\\n\\nOn every visit, she hoped she would not find what she was looking for - seven years on, she still hasn\\'t.\\n\\nActivists say thousands of ethnic Baloch people have been disappeared by Pakistan\\'s security forces in the last two decades - allegedly detained without due legal process, or abducted, tortured and killed in operations against a decades-old separatist insurgency.\\n\\nThe Pakistan government denies the allegations, insisting that many of the missing have joined separatist groups or fled the country.\\n\\nSome return after years, traumatised and broken - but many never come back. Others are found in unmarked graves that have appeared across Balochistan, their bodies so disfigured they cannot be identified.\\n\\nAnd then there are the women across generations whose lives are being defined by waiting.\\n\\nYoung and old, they take part in protests, their faces lined with grief, holding up fading photographs of men no longer in their lives. When the BBC met them at their homes, they offered us black tea - Sulemani chai - in chipped cups as they spoke in voices worn down by sorrow.\\n\\nMany of them insist their fathers, brothers and sons are innocent and have been targeted for speaking out against state policies or were taken as a form of collective punishment.\\n\\nSaira is one of them.\\n\\nShe says she started going to protests after asking the police and pleading with politicians yielded no answers about her brother\\'s whereabouts.\\n\\nMuhammad Asif Baloch was arrested in August 2018 along with 10 others in Nushki, a city along the border with Afghanistan. His family found out when they saw him on TV the next day, looking scared and dishevelled.\\n\\nAuthorities said the men were \"terrorists fleeing to Afghanistan\". Muhammad\\'s family said he was having a picnic with friends.\\n\\nSaira says Muhammad was her \"best friend\", funny and always cheerful - \"My mother worries that she\\'s forgetting his smile.\"\\n\\nThe day he went missing, Saira had aced a school exam and was excited to tell her brother, her \"biggest supporter\". Muhammad had encouraged her to attend universty in Quetta, the provincial capital.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know back then that the first time I\\'d go to Quetta, it would be for a protest demanding his release,\" Saira says.\\n\\nThree of the men who were detained along with her brother were released in 2021, but they have not spoken about what happened.\\n\\nMuhammad never came home.\\n\\nThe journey into Balochistan, in Pakistan\\'s south-west, feels like you are stepping into another world.\\n\\nIt is vast - covering about 44% of the country, the largest of Pakistan\\'s provinces - and the land is rich with gas, coal, copper and gold. It stretches along the Arabian Sea, across the water from places like Dubai, which has risen from the sands into glittering, monied skyscrapers.\\n\\nBut Balochistan remains stuck in time. Access to many parts is restricted for security reasons and foreign journalists are often denied access.\\n\\nIt\\'s also difficult to travel around. The roads are long and lonely, cutting through barren hills and desert. As the infrastructure thins out the further you travel, roads are replaced by dirt tracks created by the few vehicles that pass.\\n\\nElectricity is sporadic, water even scarcer. Schools and hospitals are dismal.\\n\\nIn the markets, men sit outside mud shops waiting for customers who rarely come. Boys, who elsewhere in Pakistan may dream of a career, only talk of escape: fleeing to Karachi, to the Gulf, to anywhere that offers a way out of this slow suffocation.\\n\\nBalochistan became a part of Pakistan in 1948, in the upheaval that followed the partition of British India - and in spite of opposition from some influential tribal leaders, who sought an independent state.\\n\\nSome of the resistance turned militant and, over the years, it has been stoked by accusations that Pakistan has exploited the resource-rich region without investing in its development.\\n\\nMilitant groups like the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), designated a terrorist group by Pakistan and other nations, have intensified their attacks: bombings, assassinations and ambushes against security forces have become more frequent.\\n\\nEarlier this month,the BLA hijacked a train in Bolan Pass, seizing hundreds of passengers. They demanded the release of missing people in Balochistan in return for freeing hostages.\\n\\nThesiege lasted over 30 hours. According to authorities, 33 BLA militants, 21 civilian hostages and four military personnel were killed. But conflicting figures suggest many passengers remain unaccounted for.\\n\\nThe disappearances in the province are widely believed to be part of Islamabad\\'s strategy to crush the insurgency - but also to suppress dissent, weaken nationalist sentiment and support for an independent Balochistan.\\n\\nMany of the missing are suspected members or sympathisers of Baloch nationalist groups that demand more autonomy or independence. But a significant number are ordinary people with no known political affiliations.\\n\\nBalochistan\\'s Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti told the BBC that enforced disappearances are an issue but dismissed the idea that they were happening on a large scale as \"systematic propaganda\".\\n\\n\"Every child in Balochistan has been made to hear \\'missing persons, missing persons\\'. But who will determine who disappeared whom?\\n\\n\"Self-disappearances exist too. How can I prove if someone was taken by intelligence agencies, police, FC, or anyone else or me or you?\"\\n\\nPakistan\\'s military spokesperson Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif recently said in a press conference that the \"state is solving the issue of missing persons in a systematic manner\".\\n\\nHe repeated the official statistic often shared by the government - of the more than 2,900 cases of enforced disappearances reported from Balochistan since 2011, 80% had been resolved.\\n\\nActivists put the figure higher - at around 7,000 â€“ but there is no single reliable source of data and no way to verify either side\\'s claims.\\n\\nWomen like Jannat Bibi refuse to accept the official number.\\n\\nShe continues to search for her son, Nazar Muhammad, who she claims was taken in 2012 while eating breakfast at a hotel.\\n\\n\"I went everywhere looking for him. I even went to Islamabad,\" she says. \"All I got were beatings and rejection.\"\\n\\nThe 70-year-old lives in a small mud house on the outskirts of Quetta, not far from a symbolic graveyard dedicated to the missing.\\n\\nJannat, who runs a tiny shop selling biscuits and milk cartons, often can\\'t afford the bus fare to attend protests demanding information about the missing. But she borrows what she can so she can keep going.\\n\\n\"Silence is not an option,\" she says.\\n\\nMost of these men - including those whose families we spoke to - disappeared after 2006.\\n\\nThat was the year a key Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, was killed in a military operation, leading to a rise in anti-state protests and armed insurgent activities.\\n\\nThe government cracked down in response - enforced disappearances increased, as did the number of bodies found on the streets.\\n\\nIn 2014, mass graves of missing people were discovered in Tootak â€“ a small town near the city of Khuzdar, where Saira lives, 275km (170 miles) south of Quetta.\\n\\nThe bodies were disfigured beyond identification. The images from Tootak shook the country - but the horror was no stranger to people in Balochistan.\\n\\nMahrang Baloch\\'s father, a famous nationalist leader who fought for Baloch rights, had disappeared in early 2009. Abdul Gaffar Langove had worked for the Pakistani government but left the job to advocate for what he believed would be a safer Balochistan.\\n\\nThree years later Mahrang received a phone call that his body had been found in Lasbela district in the south of the province.\\n\\n\"When my father\\'s body arrived, he was wearing the same clothes, now torn. He had been badly tortured,\" she says. For five years, she had nightmares about his final days. She visited his grave \"to convince myself that he was no longer alive and that he was not being tortured\".\\n\\nShe hugged his grave \"hoping to feel him, but it didn\\'t happen\".\\n\\nWhen he was arrested, Mahrang used to write him letters -  \"lots of letters and I would draw greeting cards and send them to him on Eid\". But he returned the cards, saying his prison cell was no place for such \"beautiful\" cards. He wanted her to keep them at home.\\n\\n\"I still miss his hugs,\" she says.\\n\\nAfter her father\\'s death, Mahrang says, her family\\'s world \"collapsed\".\\n\\nAnd then in 2017,  her brother was picked up by security forces, according to the family, and detained for nearly three months.\\n\\n\"It was terrifying. I made my mother believe that what happened to my father wouldn\\'t happen to my brother. But it did,\" Mahrang says. \"I was scared of looking at my phone, because it might be news of my brother\\'s body being found somewhere.\"\\n\\nShe says her mother and she found strength in each other: \"Our tiny house was our safest place, where we would sometimes sit and cry for hours. But outside, we were two strong women who couldn\\'t be crushed.\"\\n\\nIt was then that Mahrang decided to fight against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Today, the 32-year-old leads the protest movement despite death threats, legal cases and travel bans.\\n\\n\"We want the right to live on our own land without persecution. We want our resources, our rights. We want this rule of fear and violence to end.\"\\n\\nMahrang warns that enforced disappearances fuel more resistance, rather than silence it.\\n\\n\"They think dumping bodies will end this. But how can anyone forget losing their loved one this way? No human can endure this.\"\\n\\nShe demands institutional reforms, ensuring that no mother has to send her child away in fear. \"We don\\'t want our children growing up in protest camps. Is that too much to ask?\"\\n\\nMahrang was arrested on Saturday morning, a few weeks after her interview with the BBC.\\n\\nShe was leading a protest in Quetta after 13 unclaimed bodies - feared to be missing persons - were buried in the city. Authorities claimed they were militants killed after the Bolan Pass train hijacking, though this could not be independently verified.\\n\\nEarlier Mahrang had said: \"I could be arrested anytime. But I don\\'t fear it. This is nothing new for us.\"\\n\\nAnd even as she fights for the future she wants, a new generation is already on the streets.\\n\\nMasooma, 10, clutches her school bag tightly as she weaves through the crowd of protesters, her eyes scanning every face, searching for one that looks like her father\\'s.\\n\\n\"Once, I saw a man and thought he was my father. I ran to him and then realised he was someone else,\" she says.\\n\\n\"Everyone\\'s father comes home after work. I have never found mine.\"\\n\\nMasooma was just three months old when security forces allegedly took her father away during a late-night raid in Quetta.\\n\\nHer mother was told he would return in a few hours. He never did.\\n\\nToday, Masooma spends more time at protests than in the classroom. Her father\\'s photograph is always with her, tucked safely in her school bag.\\n\\nBefore every lesson begins, she takes it out and looks at it.\\n\\n\"I always wonder if my father will come home today.\"\\n\\nShe stands outside the protest camp, chanting slogans with the others, her small frame lost in the crowd of grieving families.\\n\\nAs the protest comes to an end she sits cross-legged on a thin mat in a quiet corner. The noise of slogans and traffic fades as she pulls out her folded letters - letters she has written but could never send.\\n\\nHer fingers tremble as she smooths out the creases, and in a fumbling, uncertain voice, she begins to read them.\\n\\n\"Dear Baba Jan, when will you come back? Whenever I eat or drink water, I miss you. Baba, where are you? I miss you so much. I am alone. Without you, I cannot sleep. I just want to meet you and see your face.\"\\n\\n'\n",

      " 'Sir Keir Starmer\\'s plan for an international force to support a ceasefire in Ukraine has been dismissed as \"a posture and a pose\" by Donald Trump\\'s special envoy.\\n\\nSteve Witkoff said the idea was based on a \"simplistic\" notion of the UK prime minister and other European leaders thinking \"we have all got to be like Winston Churchill\".\\n\\nIn an interview with pro-Trump journalist Tucker Carlson, Witkoff praised Vladimir Putin, saying he \"liked\" the Russian president.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t regard Putin as a bad guy,\" he said. \"He\\'s super smart.\"\\n\\nWitkoff, who met Putin 10 days ago, said the Russian president had been \"gracious\" and \"straight up\" with him. Putin told him, he added, that he had prayed for Trump after an assassination attempt against him last year. He also said Putin had commissioned a portrait of the US president as a gift and Trump was \"clearly touched by it\".\\n\\nDuring the interview, Witkoff repeated various Russian arguments, including that Ukraine was \"a false country\" and asked when the world would recognise occupied Ukrainian territory as Russian.\\n\\nWitkoff is leading the US ceasefire negotiations with both Russia and Ukraine but he was unable to name the five regions of Ukraine either annexed or partially occupied by Russian forces.\\n\\nHe said: \"The largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions, Donbas, Crimea, you know the names and there are two others.\"\\n\\nThe five regions - or oblasts - are Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Crimea. Donbas refers to an industrial region in the east that includes much of Luhansk and Donetsk.\\n\\nWitkoff made several assertions that are either not true or disputed:\\n\\nThe US is set to hold separate talks in Saudi Arabia with Ukraine and Russia about a ceasefire at meetings over Sunday and Monday.\\n\\nAhead of that, Ukrainian authorities said Russia had launched drone attacks on Kyiv overnight, resulting in deaths of three people, including a five-year-old child.\\n\\nOfficials said that eight people had been injured.\\n\\nRussia also struck the southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday, killing a family of three.\\n\\nMeanwhile, on Sunday Russia\\'s ministry of defence said it had shot down 59 Ukrainian drones across a number of regions in the south as well as in Crimea, the peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.\\n\\nDuring his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion.\\n\\nHe said it was \"correct\" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"\\n\\nHe added: \"There\\'s a sensibility in Russia that Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched together in this sort of mosaic, these regions, and that\\'s what is the root cause, in my opinion, of this war, that Russia regards those five regions as rightfully theirs since World War Two, and that\\'s something nobody wants to talk about.\"\\n\\nPutin has repeatedly said that the \"root causes\" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.\\n\\nWitkoff said in theTucker Carlson interview: \"Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don\\'t need to absorb Ukraineâ€¦ They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\"\\n\\nAsked about Keir Starmer\\'s plans to forge a \"coalition of the willing\" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: \"I think it\\'s a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.\"\\n\\nHe said a ceasefire in the Black Sea would be \"implemented over the next week or so\" and \"we are not far away\" from a full 30-day ceasefire.\\n\\nHe also gave details of how Trump wanted to co-operate with Russia after relations had been normalised. \"Who doesn\\'t want to have a world where Russia and the US are doing collaboratively good things together, thinking about how to integrate their energy polices in the Arctic, share sea lines maybe, send LNG gas into Europe together, maybe collaborate on AI together?\"\\n\\n'\n",

      " 'Having a chip in your brain that can translate your thoughts into computer commands may sound like science fiction - but it is a reality for Noland Arbaugh.\\n\\nIn January 2024 - eight years after he was paralysed - the 30-year-old became the first person to get such a device from the US neurotechnology firm, Neuralink.\\n\\nIt was not the first such chip - a handful of other companies have also developed and implanted them - but Noland\\'s inevitably attracts more attention because of Neuralink\\'s founder: Elon Musk.\\n\\nBut Noland says the important thing is neither him nor Musk - but the science.\\n\\nHe told the BBC he knew the risks of what he was doing - but \"good or bad, whatever may be, I would be helping\".\\n\\n\"If everything worked out, then I could help being a participant of Neuralink,\" he said.\\n\\n\"If something terrible happened, I knew they would learn from it.\"\\n\\nNoland, who is from Arizona, was paralysed below the shoulders in a diving accident in 2016.\\n\\nHis injuries were so severe he feared he might not be able to study, work or even play games again.\\n\\n\"You just have no control, no privacy, and it\\'s hard,\" he said.\\n\\n\"You have to learn that you have to rely on other people for everything.\"\\n\\nThe Neuralink chip looks to restore a fraction of his previous independence, by allowing him to control a computer with his mind.\\n\\nIt is what is known as a brain computer interface (BCI) - which works by detecting the tiny electrical impulses generated when humans think about moving, and translating these into digital command, such as moving a cursor on a screen.\\n\\nIt is a complex subject that scientists have been working on for several decades.\\n\\nInevitably, Elon Musk\\'s involvement in the field has catapulted the tech - and Noland Arbaugh - into the headlines.\\n\\nIt\\'s helped Neuralink attract lots of investment - as well as scrutiny over the safety and significance of what is an extremely invasive procedure.\\n\\nWhen Noland\\'s implant was announced,experts hailed it as a \"significant milestone\", while also cautioning that it would take time to really assess - especially given Musk\\'s adeptness at \"generating publicity for his company.\"\\n\\nMusk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\"\\n\\nIn reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.\\n\\n\"I think he was just as excited as I was to get started,\" he said.\\n\\nNonetheless, he stresses that Neuralink is about more than its owner, and claims he does not consider it \"an Elon Musk device\".\\n\\nWhether the rest of the world sees it that way -especially given his increasingly controversial role in the US government- remains to be seen.\\n\\nBut there is no questioning the impact the device has had on Noland\\'s life.\\n\\nWhen Noland awoke from the surgery which installed the device, he said he was initially able to control a cursor on a screen by thinking about wiggling his fingers.\\n\\n\"Honestly I didn\\'t know what to expect - it sounds so sci-fi,\" he said.\\n\\nBut after seeing his neurons spike on a screen - all the while surrounded by excited Neuralink employees - he said \"it all sort of sunk in\" that he could control his computer with just his thoughts.\\n\\nAnd - even better - over time his ability to use the implant has grown to the point he can now play chess and video games.\\n\\n\"I grew up playing games,\" he said - adding it was something he \"had to let go of\" when he became disabled.\\n\\n\"Now I\\'m beating my friends at games, which really shouldn\\'t be possible but it is.\"\\n\\nNoland is a powerful demonstration of the tech\\'s potential to change lives - but there may be drawbacks too.\\n\\n\"One of the main problems is privacy,\" said Anil Seth, Professor of Neuroscience, University of Sussex.\\n\\n\"So if we are exporting our brain activity [...] then we are kind of allowing access to not just what we do but potentially what we think, what we believe and what we feel,\" he told the BBC.\\n\\n\"Once you\\'ve got access to stuff inside your head, there really is no other barrier to personal privacy left.\"\\n\\nBut these aren\\'t concerns for Noland - instead he wants to see the chips go further in terms of what they can do.\\n\\nHe told the BBC he hoped the device could eventually allow him to control his wheelchair, or even a futuristic humanoid robot.\\n\\nEven with the tech in its current, more limited state, it hasn\\'t all been smooth sailing though.\\n\\nAt one point, an issue with the device caused him to lose control of his computer altogether, when it partially disconnected from his brain.\\n\\n\"That was really upsetting to say the least,\" he said.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know if I would be able to use Neuralink ever again.\"\\n\\nThe connection was repaired - and subsequently improved - when engineers adjusted the software, but it highlighted a concern frequently voiced by experts over the technology\\'s limitations.\\n\\nNeuralink is just one of many companies exploring how to digitally tap into our brain power.\\n\\nSynchron is one such firm, which says its Stentrode device aimed at helping people with  motor neurone disease requires a less invasive surgery to implant.\\n\\nRather than requiring open brain surgery, it is installed into a person\\'s jugular vein in their neck, then moved up to their brain through a blood vessel.\\n\\nLike Neuralink, the device ultimately connects to the motor region of the brain.\\n\\n\"It picks up when someone is thinking of tapping or not tapping their finger,\" said chief technology officer Riki Bannerjee.\\n\\n\"By being able to pick up those differences it can create what we call a digital motor output.\"\\n\\nThat output is then turned into computer signals, where it is currently being used by 10 people.\\n\\nOne such person, who did not want his last name to be used, told the BBC he was the first person in the world to use the device with Apple\\'s Vision Pro headset.\\n\\nMark said this has allowed him to virtually holiday in far-flung locations - from standing in waterfalls in Australia to strolling across mountains in New Zealand.\\n\\n\"I can see down the road in the future a world where this technology could really, really make a difference for someone that has this or any paralysis,\" he said.\\n\\nBut for Noland there is one caveat with his Neuralink chip - he agreed to be part of a study which installed it for six years, after which point the future is less clear.\\n\\nWhatever happens to him, he believes his experience may be merely scratching the surface of what might one day become a reality.\\n\\n\"We know so little about the brain and this is allowing us to learn so much more,\" he said.\\n\\nAdditional reporting by Yasmin Morgan-Griffiths.\\n\\n'\n",

Five minutes later, the teenagers returned.\\n\\n\"I thought, \\'oh no â€“ I don\\'t have anything left,\\'\" Athena says. \"I opened the door and the kids were stood there with bags of candy.\\n\\n\"And then they handed them to my child because they thought that he might not have any more candy.\"\\n\\nShe adds: \"It was absolutely wonderful because teenagers get such a bad rap nowadays.\"\\n\\nAthena says their behaviour just reaffirms her faith in humanity and young people in particular. \"The next generation has so much kindness and empathy... at some point, the world is going to be in really good hands.\"\\n\\nHer positive view of young people is shared by Jocelyn Tress, 88, and her husband Mark, 89.\\n\\nThe couple were on their way to the airport from their home in Fulham, southwest London when one of their tyres was punctured on the M25.\\n\\nGiven their age and the speed of the traffic, they didn\\'t dare change the tyre themselves, and rang the AA. They were told someone might be there in around half an hour. They feared they would miss their flight to Portugal, where they were supposed to be going on holiday.\\n\\nTen minutes later, however, a young man in a white van pulled up behind them on the hard shoulder. He said he had noticed them parked there after initially driving past them, so he turned off the motorway and came back to see if they needed any help.\\n\\n\"He quickly changed our tyre,\" says Jocelyn. In the hurry she forgot to find out his name but did ask why he had stopped.\\n\\nJocelyn recalls him saying: \"When I went past and saw you were in trouble, I thought, suppose they were my granny and grandpa?\"\\n\\nShe adds: \"He would accept nothing for his kindness.\"\\n\\nJocelyn says there have been occasions when she has fallen on the pavement, only to be helped up by a young person nearby. \"I think on the whole young people are very, very helpful,\" she says.\\n\\nThe stranger who helped Sarah Marten, 66, was older but intervened at a similar time of need. Her story is from 25 years ago, but the impression it left on her remains today.\\n\\nShe was in the John Lewis store in Brent Cross, west London with her children to find a leotard, tutu and tights for her three-year-old daughter Emily, who was about to start ballet lessons.\\n\\nFinding the right size and style had taken quite a long time. Her son Joel, who is 19 months younger than his sister, was not enjoying himself. \"Because he was so young, it had been quite a stressful morning to be honest,\" Sarah tells us. \"He was ready to get back in the car.\"\\n\\nAt the till, Sarah\\'s debit card was declined by her bank. She had neither a credit card nor enough cash with her to make the purchase. After such a trying morning, and with her children now desperate to go home, Sarah became upset.\\n\\nThen a man behind her in the queue stepped forward and asked her how much money she needed.\\n\\nHe opened his wallet and insisted he pay for the ballerina clothes.\\n\\nHe gave her Â£40. \"That was quite a lot back then,\" says Sarah. \"I was very surprised that somebody would do something like that and not expect the money back.\"\\n\\nThe man did not want to be repaid but Sarah insisted and took his business card. She sent him the money shortly afterwards.\\n\\n\"I remember him being really charming and very kind,\" she says. \"I have actually told other people that he was an angel for me in those circumstances.\"\\n\\nSarah, whose children now work in food and music, says remembering that act of kindness and hearing of similar deeds helps restore her faith in human nature.\\n\\n'\n",

Some were close friends. Others were godfathers to each other\\'s children. The location of his current air base in western Ukraine cannot be revealed for security reasons.\\n\\nBut as US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire gather pace - and fresh talks with Russia and Ukraine planned on Monday - things have changed.\\n\\n\"If any ceasefire comes [about], we will feel safer,\" says Maria.\\n\\nAcross Ukraine, more and more people are openly talking about war fatigue. They\\'re calling for an end to the most brutal fighting in Europe since World War Two, and for firm guarantees of Western protection to ensure Russia can\\'t attack again.\\n\\nAt the same time, Maria fears that any deal could involve accepting the loss of four Ukrainian regions in the south-eastpartially seized by Russia, as well as Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. \"Nobody will give us back our lost territories\", the 29-year-old says. \"They will stay under Russian occupation.\"\\n\\nShe asks: \"What [did] so many men, our heroes, sacrifice their lives for if Ukraine can\\'t fight for them, and is forced to make concessions?\"\\n\\nWhen Maria and Ivan met, the prospect of a full-scale war in Ukraine seemed impossible.\\n\\nMaria was an English teacher at a local children\\'s club in western Ukraine attended by the daughter of one of Ivan\\'s comrades.

They soon started seeing each other.\\n\\nOn one of their first dates, Ivan warned Maria he had a dangerous job. She said it wouldn\\'t be a problem. Ivan was courageous, caring and protective, and Maria was falling in love.\\n\\nHe soon had to go on a long-term deployment far from home. They lost touch for a year, and it seemed like their relationship might be over.\\n\\nBut then he returned with a giant bouquet of flowers and promised her he didn\\'t want to waste her time. Within a year, the two were married and they were soon expecting their first child.\\n\\nIt was only once Russia launched its full-scale invasion that Maria understood what he\\'d meant about the harsh realities of his work.\\n\\nTheir daughter Yaroslava was only three months old at the time. Ivan missed her early milestones: helping her take her first steps, seeing her first teeth come through and comforting her during her first illness.\\n\\n\"When Ivan is deployed far away from home, I send him thousands of our daughter\\'s photos to help him feel that at least virtually he is spending the day with us,\" says Maria.\\n\\nOn one nearby mission, Maria put her daughter in a pram and rushed to a checkpoint where he could run out to catch them for five minutes.\\n\\nShe brought him home-made food.

      " 'Maria\\'s life has been reduced to waiting for the next phone call from her husband - never knowing if it might be the last.\\n\\nIvan, a 31-year-old Ukrainian fighter pilot, began defending the skies from the very first hours of Russia\\'s full-scale invasion in February 2022, and has now flown more than 200 perilous missions in his old Soviet-era Mig-29 warplane.\\n\\nThe squadron commander has lost several comrades in the war. Some were close friends. Others were godfathers to each other\\'s children. The location of his current air base in western Ukraine cannot be revealed for security reasons.\\n\\nBut as US-led efforts to negotiate a ceasefire gather pace - and fresh talks with Russia and Ukraine planned on Monday - things have changed.\\n\\n\"If any ceasefire comes [about], we will feel safer,\" says Maria.\\n\\nAcross Ukraine, more and more people are openly talking about war fatigue. They\\'re calling for an end to the most brutal fighting in Europe since World War Two, and for firm guarantees of Western protection to ensure Russia can\\'t attack again.\\n\\nAt the same time, Maria fears that any deal could involve accepting the loss of four Ukrainian regions in the south-eastpartially seized by Russia, as well as Crimea, annexed by Russia in 2014. \"Nobody will give us back our lost territories\", the 29-year-old says. \"They will stay under Russian occupation.\"\\n\\nShe asks: \"What [did] so many men, our heroes, sacrifice their lives for if Ukraine can\\'t fight for them, and is forced to make concessions?\"\\n\\nWhen Maria and Ivan met, the prospect of a full-scale war in Ukraine seemed impossible.\\n\\nMaria was an English teacher at a local children\\'s club in western Ukraine attended by the daughter of one of Ivan\\'s comrades. The comrade offered to set Ivan up with Maria, who he described as \"a very nice teacher\".\\n\\nAt first Ivan felt pressured by the arrangement - but he eventually agreed to come.\\n\\nHe was glad he did. They soon started seeing each other.\\n\\nOn one of their first dates, Ivan warned Maria he had a dangerous job. She said it wouldn\\'t be a problem. Ivan was courageous, caring and protective, and Maria was falling in love.\\n\\nHe soon had to go on a long-term deployment far from home. They lost touch for a year, and it seemed like their relationship might be over.\\n\\nBut then he returned with a giant bouquet of flowers and promised her he didn\\'t want to waste her time. Within a year, the two were married and they were soon expecting their first child.\\n\\nIt was only once Russia launched its full-scale invasion that Maria understood what he\\'d meant about the harsh realities of his work.\\n\\nTheir daughter Yaroslava was only three months old at the time. Ivan missed her early milestones: helping her take her first steps, seeing her first teeth come through and comforting her during her first illness.\\n\\n\"When Ivan is deployed far away from home, I send him thousands of our daughter\\'s photos to help him feel that at least virtually he is spending the day with us,\" says Maria.\\n\\nOn one nearby mission, Maria put her daughter in a pram and rushed to a checkpoint where he could run out to catch them for five minutes.\\n\\nShe brought him home-made food. They talked. And found that every minute together was worth the months they\\'d spent waiting.\\n\\nBefore Yaroslava could even speak, she would use her tiny hands to gesture that her dad was flying through the skies.\\n\\n\"Our daughter knows that her dad is a pilot,\" she says. \"When she had a birthday and her father ate a birthday cake over a video call, we explained to her that he couldn\\'t be with us as he was defending Ukraine from the Russians.\"\\n\\nThe family now have a professional photo taken of them every six months. \"It\\'s very hard for me to say but I have to be completely honest. We never know if it [will be] our final call or meeting,\" Maria says, on the brink of tears.\\n\\nShe feels she has to be ready for \"everything, including the worst-case scenario\".\\n\\nDuring the first year of the war, she would regularly hear about casualties among friends. \"You call their wives and can\\'t find the words to say.

      " 'Scenes playing out in Nigeria during holiday periods could be in a movie: emotional reunions at airport terminals, champagne flowing like water in high-end clubs and A-list Afrobeats performers dominating stages to packed audiences nationwide.\\n\\nThis is when Nigerians abroad return for a visit to the home country. They are nicknamed I Just Got Back (IJGB) and bring with them more than full suitcases.\\n\\nTheir Western accents dip in and out of Pidgin, their wallets are boosted by the exchange rate, and their presence fuels the economy.\\n\\nBut it also highlights an uncomfortable truth.\\n\\nThose who live in Nigeria, earning in the local naira currency, feel shut out of their own cities, especially in the economic hub of Lagos and the capital, Abuja, as prices go up during festive periods.\\n\\nResidents say this is particularly the case for \"Detty December\", a term used to refer the celebrations around Christmas and New Year.\\n\\nDetty December makes Lagos almost unliveable for locals - traffic is horrible, prices inflate and businesses stop prioritising their regular customers, a radio presenter based in Lagos tells the BBC.\\n\\nThe popular media personality asked not to be named for voicing what some might consider controversial opinions.\\n\\nBut he is not the only one to hold these views and has some are pondering, with Easter and the diaspora summer holiday season approaching, whether the IJGBs are helping bridge Nigeria\\'s class divide or are making it even wider.\\n\\n\"Nigeria is very classist. Ironically, we\\'re a poor country, so it\\'s a bit silly,\" the radio presenter adds.\\n\\n\"The wealth gap is massive. It\\'s almost like we\\'re worlds apart.\"\\n\\nIt is true that despite oil-rich Nigeria being one of Africa\\'s biggest economies and the continent\\'s most populous country, its more than 230 million citizens face huge challenges and limited opportunities.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year,the charity Oxfam warnedthe wealth gap in Nigeria was reaching a \"crisis level\".\\n\\nStatistics from 2023 are startling.\\n\\nAccording to the World Inequality Database more than 10% of the population owned more than 60% of Nigeria\\'s wealth. For those with jobs, 10% of the population took home 42% of the income.\\n\\nThe World Bank says the figure of those living below the poverty line is 87 million - \"the world\\'s second-largest poor population after India\".\\n\\nMartins Ifeanacho, professor of sociology at the University of Port Harcourt, says this gap and resulting class divide has grown since Nigeria\\'s independence from the UK in 1960.\\n\\n\"We\\'ve gone through so much economic hardship,\" the academic, who returned to Nigeria after studying in Ireland in the 1990s, tells the BBC.\\n\\nHe points the finger at the greed of those who are in position of political power - be it at a federal or state level.\\n\\n\"We have a political elite that bases its calculations on how to acquire power, amass wealth for the purpose of capturing more power.\\n\\n\"The ordinary people are left out of the equation, and that\\'s why there is a lot of hardship.\"\\n\\nBut it is not just about money in the bank account.\\n\\nWealth, real or perceived, can dictate access, status and opportunity - and the presence of the diaspora can magnify the class divide.\\n\\n\"Nigeria\\'s class system is hard to pinpoint. It\\'s not just about money, it\\'s about perception,\" explains the radio presenter.\\n\\nHe gives the example of going out for a meal in Lagos and how peacocking is so important.\\n\\nAt restaurants, those arriving in a Range Rover are quickly attended to, while those in a Kia may be ignored, says the radio presenter.\\n\\nSocial mobility is difficult when the nation\\'s wealth remains within a small elite.\\n\\nWith odds stacked against those trying to climb the ladder, for many Nigerians the only realistic path to a better life is to leave.\\n\\nThe World Bank blames \"weak job creation and entrepreneurial prospects\" that stifle the absorption of \"the 3.5 million Nigerians entering the labour force every year\".\\n\\n\"Many workers choose to emigrate in search of better opportunities,\" it says.\\n\\nSince the 1980s, middle-class Nigerians have sought opportunities abroad, but in recent years, the urgency has intensified, especially among Gen Z and millennials.\\n\\nThis mass exodus has been dubbed \"japa\", a Yoruba word meaning \"to escape\".\\n\\nA 2022 surveyfound that at least 70% of young Nigerians would relocate if they could.\\n\\nBut for many, leaving is not simple. Studying abroad, the most common route, can cost tens of thousands of dollars, not including travel, accommodation and visa expenses.\\n\\n\"Japa creates this aspirational culture where people now want to leave the country,\" says Lulu Okwara, a 28-year-old recruitment officer.\\n\\nShe went the UK to study finance in 2021 - and is one of the IJGBs, having returned to Nigeria at least three times since moving.\\n\\nMs Okwara notes that in Nigeria there is a pressure to succeed. A culture where achievement is expected.\\n\\n\"It\\'s success or nothing,\" she tells the BBC. \"There is no room for failure.\"\\n\\nThis deeply embedded sentiment makes people feel they must do anything to succeed.\\n\\nEspecially for those who come from more working-class backgrounds. The IJGBs have a point to prove.\\n\\n\"When people go out there, their dream is always to come back as heroes, mostly during Christmas or other festivities,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\\n\\n\"You come back home and you mix with your people that you\\'ve missed for a long time.\\n\\n\"The type of welcome they will give to you, the children that will be running to you, is something that you love and cherish.\"\\n\\nSuccess is chased at any cost and putting on a foreign accent can help you climb Nigeria\\'s social ladder - even if you have not been abroad.\\n\\n\"People fake accents to get access. The more you sound British, the higher your social status,\" says Prof Ifeanacho.\\n\\nHe recalls a story about a pastor who preached every Sunday on the radio.\\n\\n\"When they told me that this man had not left Nigeria, I said, \\'No, that\\'s not possible.\\' Because when you hear him speak, everything is American,\" he says in disbelief.\\n\\nAmerican and British accents, especially, act as a different kind of currency, smoothing paths in both professional and social settings.\\n\\nPushback on social media suggests some IJGBs are all front - they may lap up the returning hero adulation but in fact lack financial clout.\\n\\nBizzle Osikoya, the owner at The Plug Entertainment, a business that hosts live music events in West Africa, says he has encountered some issues that reflect this.\\n\\nHe tells the BBC about how several IJGBs have attended his events - but who have gone on to try and get their money back.\\n\\n\"They went back to the US and Canada and put a dispute on their payments,\" he says.\\n\\nThis may reflect the desperate effort to maintain a faÃ§ade of success in a society where every display of wealth is scrutinised.\\n\\nIn Nigeria, it seems, performance is key - and the IJGBs who are able to show off will certainly be able to climb the class ladder.\\n\\nGo toBBCAfrica.comfor more news from the African continent.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us on Twitter@BBCAfrica, on Facebook atBBC Africaor on Instagram atbbcafrica\\n\\n'\n",

Trump has also vowed to impose a sweeping range of \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 2 April.\\n\\nJoly said that because the US and Canadian economies are so intertwined, \"we have the most leverage in the world when it comes to the US\".\\n\\nShe noted it is not just Canadians feeling the pain from tariffs, but \"hardworking Americans\" too.\\n\\nBut Joly said it could be Americans who are the most successful in urging an end to the trade war.\\n\\n\"We think that ultimately the only ones that will be able to help us win this war... are the Americans themselves because they\\'re the ones that can send a message to their lawmakers,\" she told the BBC.\\n\\n\"We can win the hearts and minds of Americans, because ultimately they\\'re the ones paying for this\" she added, noting that both American and Canadian jobs are at risk because of the tariffs.\\n\\nThe trade war is expected to be at the forefront of Canadians\\' minds when they head to the polls in their first federal election in nearly a decade.\\n\\nReports suggest Prime Minister Carney couldcall for a snap electionon Sunday. That election is expected to be held on 28 April.\\n\\nAnd it is not just the Liberals making the case against US tariffs, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has also been on the trade war.

      " 'An Israeli air strike on the southern city of Khan Younis in Gaza has killed top Hamas political leader Salah al-Bardaweel, a Hamas official has told the BBC.\\n\\nLocals say the air strike killed both Bardaweel, regarded as Hamas\\'s highest-ranking political leader, and his wife. Israeli officials had no immediate comment.\\n\\nThe total death toll in Gaza since the war began surpassed 50,000 on Sunday, its Hamas-run health authorities said, with least 30 people killed in Khan Yunis and Rafah so far on Sunday.\\n\\nIsrael resumed heavy strikes on Gaza earlier this week - in effect ending the first phase of a ceasefire that lasted almost two months. It blamed Hamas for rejecting a new US proposal to extend the truce.\\n\\nHamas, in turn, accused Israel of abandoning the original deal - mediated by Qatar, Egypt and the US. It envisaged the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the subsequent release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners - in addition to negotiations to end the war entirely and reconstruct Gaza.\\n\\nIn a statement on Sunday, Hamas said Bardaweel, 66, had been praying along with his wife when an Israeli missile struck their tent.\\n\\nA father of eight, Bardaweel was one of Hamas\\'s most prominent political figures.\\n\\nBorn in Khan Younis refugee camp, he was known to be close to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and is considered part of the second generation of Hamas leadership, following the movement\\'s founders.\\n\\nHe headed the political wing of Hamas\\'s parliamentary bloc and was re-elected to the group\\'s political bureau in 2021.\\n\\nFollowing the killing of Sinwar and Rawhi Mushtaha during the ongoing war, Bardaweel was regarded as Hamas\\'s highest-ranking political leader.\\n\\nThe air strike that killed Bardaweel was part of one of the most intense waves of aerial bombardment in southern Gaza since the collapse of the ceasefire agreement last Tuesday.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent Society told the BBC that Israeli forces were surrounding several of the organisation\\'s ambulances as they attempted to reach an area hit by an Israeli strike in Rafah.\\n\\nHe added that several paramedics were wounded, and contact had been lost with one of the trapped teams, which has been besieged for hours.\\n\\nThe Israeli military issued evacuation orders for residents of the Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood in western Rafah after the area was hit by heavy shelling and a limited ground assault.\\n\\nThe attack included tank fire from Israeli forces positioned along the Philadelphi Corridor on the border with Egypt, and helicopters also took part in the assault.\\n\\nAlaa al-Din Sabah, a resident of the neighbourhood, said in a voice message to the BBC: \"Bullets are raining down on us like it\\'s pouring. A woman was shot and is bleeding. Ambulances couldn\\'t reach her.\"\\n\\n\"I can see one of the paramedics lying on the ground, screaming.\"\\n\\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.\\n\\nMore than 49,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says, and there is large-scale destruction to homes and infrastructure in the Strip.\\n\\n'\n",
